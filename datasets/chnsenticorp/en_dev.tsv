1	The environment and service attitude of this hotel is also quite good, but the room space is too small~~ It is not said that it can accommodate too much luggage~~ And the style of the room is OK~~ The Cantonese dim sum in the Chinese restaurant is not very delicious~~ It needs to be improved~~ ~~But the price is reasonable~~acceptable~~The style of western restaurants is very good~~but the taste is average and it is too patient to wait~~I need to improve~~ 
1	<Recommended Book> It is recommended to all fans who like <Red Mansion> to collect this book. You must know that when I heard about this book, I spent a long time in the library looking for and borrowing it, but I couldn't do it this time. As soon as you see Dangdang there, buy it immediately, and red fans should also remember to stock up! 
0	The shortage of goods has not been discovered yet, Jingdong’s order processing speed is really...Packing is completed on Tuesday, and delivery is only on Friday... 
1	I have lived here in Fuzhou since 2001. This time I feel that the room is a little bit better and the hot spring water is still available. Overall very satisfied. Breakfast is simpler. 
1	A good netbook with a beautiful appearance, the operating system should be a big selling point, and the battery is okay. On the whole, the positioning as a netbook is good. 
0	The carpet in the room is too dirty, it is very noisy near the train station, but fortunately it is double-glazed. The service is average. The TAXI at the entrance of the hotel is a long-term cooperative relationship of the hotel, and monthly fees must be paid to the hotel. From the hotel to the airport, it costs 147 yuan to pay the meter, and then it has to be 200 yuan. You may be slaughtered 30-40 yuan. 
0	I wanted to look through it when I was okay, but unfortunately I couldn’t stand it. It’s still incomparable with Zhang. Most of his books sell well because of Zhang’s influence. I really don’t like this man. I don’t know how to buy it. I regret it. 
1	The appearance of this machine is very good, I like it, the performance is good, it is an LED display, the wireless network card is: 5100AGN wireless network card, if you install a 2G 800MHZ memory, it is invincible, the notebook has a small heat, and overall it is very worthwhile I bought it, provided that this machine was bought by 4299. 
1	The full keyboard and the graphics card with numeric keys are powerful enough. Compared with A card, it is easy for N card to prefer N card GHOST XP. In addition to fingerprint recognition. All drivers can be installed, fingerprint recognition, friends who have to use XP, Alternative drivers can be used. Contribute the driver address: http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/F9Dc/Fingerprints_XP_080530.zip (ASUS official address, rest assured) 
1	The workmanship is beautiful, and my wife likes it very much. T4200 is enough, a good price-performance machine. It was very comfortable after a test. Prepare TWOW to take a lap tonight and see how the whole machine performs! 
1	This book is the second book I contacted Li Yueer. The book analyzes the reasons behind the representative performance of the child, telling parents what kind of behavior we should be happy with, what kind of behavior we should pay attention to, and what kind of education the child's behavior reflects... This is a book from the child A book summed up from the heart, children are telling us how to be parents. The paper quality of the book is a bit rough, I wonder if it was originally designed like this? However, the advantages of content have surpassed everything, and I don't mind this. 
1	Twenty years ago, I read the original English version in college and I was deeply moved. I always wanted to buy a collection after graduation, but I never found it. I searched the Chinese version of this book on the Internet a few days ago, and read it again DOWN. Once again decided to buy a collection. Unexpectedly, I found it on Dangdang. Obviously, this book has received little attention, half of the cover is yellowed, and it seems that it has been half-pressed under other books for a long time, and it has fallen a lot of dirt. The pages of the book are yellow, not smooth, and not shiny, but I really like this feeling, it feels like a book rather than a pictorial. 
0	The author writes this question from the perspective of a person who thinks he is a success, and it feels very unobjective. Although I don't like it very much, there are many views that are still desirable. 
1	I checked in on January 20th. . Book a big bed room. COSCO is located in the west ring, obviously with interior decoration style. . Haha. For example, the TV can receive Central One without cnn. . 400 a night. . 380 and one night in two days. I think it's worth it! What lg and I think best is the big bath. . I am tired from the street every day. . You can take a refreshing bath. . It is really. . . goooooooood. Other equipment is relatively simple. . But this price. . Such a large area (less to say, 25 square meters) is difficult to find in hk. . For people who love subways. . The only flaw is that his location is far from the subway. . The Empire of Hong Kong Island where I used to live is much more convenient. . . . 
0	The name of Dangdang does not match the truth, and the order will not be delivered for many days. Asking the customer service will only defer, and will only ask the user to place another order. Such service can't keep customers. It is better to go to other websites to buy books. 
0	It turned out to be piano lacquer, not matte, a little regret. Because of the battery, I feel a little heavier, no way, and the relationship with the bear's paw 
0	XP driver is hard to find! I picked up the goods on the 17th, now the price is reduced by 100 yuan, and also sent anti-virus software! 
1	It is a practical and concise design reference book! ! The book elaborates on the principles and reference knowledge of air-conditioning technology, the design characteristics and air-conditioning methods of various buildings, the design methods and steps of air-conditioning systems, the methods and characteristics of cold and heat sources, and typical solutions for automatic control and monitoring of air-conditioning systems. ; It also fully reflects the progress and development of air conditioning design in recent years. This book can be used as a reference for air-conditioning design, marketing, installation and operation management personnel, as well as for undergraduates and graduate students majoring in architectural environment and equipment engineering. 
0	There is no optical drive, and reinstalling Windows requires an external optical drive, which will be very troublesome for computer novices (no one can use Linux) 
1	This set of books is very good. My daughter loves it when she sees it. She takes a Journey to the West and reads it very enthusiastically. Although she doesn't have much literacy, the vivid pictures are enough to make her connect the TV series with the book. , Which is the Dragon King of East China Sea. The delivery is also very fast, but the one who is unhappy is the deliveryman. Originally ordered a dozen books at a time, it was an order, he complained, why don’t you make an order with two books, so there are several orders, like yours, I can’t make money with a dozen books per order. No one wants to give so much. 
1	Heqing is really good. The business single room I live in is very large, with complete facilities and a very warm feeling. What makes me particularly satisfied is the hill behind the hotel. I walked up along the path. There are many trees and some blooming flowers. One side of the hill is clear water and some small islands in the distance, especially in summer. very comfortable. Next time I will live in Heqing. 
1	I originally bought this book for 10,000 yuan per person. I really want to know what the content of the book will touch everyone. I want to arrange him as a movie. After watching it, it is indeed very emotional, although I feel that it is smiling There is actually no need to write a continuation of living, but since everyone is in favor of it, it shows how important it is to persist in faith and to be optimistic in the post-war era. A simple life is really interesting. I believe if I were this person. No matter what mom raised, I think he will be a person with a clear conscience, so it is a good book 
1	"I bought this book because of the original author Wang Guowei. In fact, my literary level is enough to read the ""Song Ci Appreciation Dictionary"". ""Human Cihua"" is a bit more advanced to me. What often appears and expresses in the book is an ""artistic conception"", which cannot be subordinated. When commenting on a word or a sentence, if the reader is not very familiar with the original sentence, how to appreciate the artistic conception. I had no choice but to put it down when I couldn't see two paragraphs. I bought this book only because the author is Wang Guowei. I have great admiration for modern Chinese cultural figures. They have real knowledge and true temperament when they are born at an untimely time. Unlike today's ""scholars"" and ""masters"" are true or false. "
0	Slowly reading one by one, the original cover of the book had problems, and finally found that the book content had problems with binding. I hope I won't receive books like this in the future, so I don't even want to buy them here, alas! I just ordered some more books, and I hope that these problems won't happen again. . 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, unexpectedly beautiful, the workmanship is very good, very suitable for girls to use. Added a 2G memory, the speed is very fast. Who says Vista is difficult to use? Hehe, it's all about others. The sound effect is also good. 
1	My son will soon turn 4 years old. After getting this handmade book, he can't wait to make it. I did a few with him, and then let him play by himself. Maybe it’s too small to be folded by the line, and the scissors are not used well. They cut off the wrong way, so there is no one set by him. The little guy himself is very interested in the hand-made work done by himself. I used to only know about watching TV, but now I will spend some time to make it. My goal has been achieved. Suggestion: This book is good for 5-year-old children. Small scissors are better and safe. 
1	This is a very upsetting baby book. Although slurred, I feel that this is the only way to describe it. Baby Anne has always given me the impression of a silent woman with a complicated and heavy mood. She is used to using pen instead of language, and she is alone in a corner quietly engraving and reading gloomy words. So when I saw a collection of essays from Yi, I subconsciously ignored it. I guess this must be another copy of those immutable words, full of coolness. But you might as well open the first page and look at the table of contents first. This book is a leap, a change, which I found from the catalog. 
1	"The room was very big, and everyone was taken aback. There is a supermarket and snack night market opposite, and there is a bakery next door, which is very convenient. From the passenger terminal, directly take the No. 1 bus (departure station) to Carver. The name of the station is ""Shaolin Hotel"". It only costs 2 yuan to ride a bouncing car. The facilities in the room are good, but the side facing the road is also noisy, and the parking lot on the inner side is also noisy. Breakfast is the standard of the factory canteen, so I only score 4 points. "
0	There is nothing to say about the content of the book, mainly the paper, the printing is too poor, the paper used is very rough and worse than ordinary pirated books, and the cut is not good. The quality of this book sold in physical bookstores is much better than that of Dangdang 
1	This set of picture books is very suitable for 1-3 year old babies. The pictures and text are very concise, which can give parents and children a lot of space. Some people may think that the content is too simple and a bit repetitive, but for a little baby, he can't take in too much information at once, and moderate repetition is more helpful to her memory. The baby especially likes to read the toothbrushing book in it. Combined with seeing adults brushing their teeth, I find it more interesting. We take this opportunity to rinse her mouth and brush her teeth after drinking milk every night. Recommend to everyone. 
1	Good room service at the front desk! The breakfast is also very rich and the price is clean enough. make persistent efforts! Chinese hotels have few smoke-free rooms, or putting ashtrays in drawers is smoke-free treatment. Do 75% non-smokers like us need to endure 25% more smokers? I hope that hotels run by China will learn from foreign companies. Please provide more non-smoking floors. Thank you. There is no smoke-free floor in my original room rate, so I have to pay an additional 20% to upgrade the non-smoking floor room with a higher level. We are the 75% non-smokers, it is about time that the Hotel respect us to have the freedom of freshair, BAN the Smokers in the Check-in or Check-out counter please. Thank you. No or very few smoke-free rooms! Smoking is not allowed in the elevator, and there are still some smokers who still do not obey the rules! I am a non-smoker and a victim of second-hand smoke! (Out of China’s 1.3 billion population, there are only 320 million smokers. Less than 1/4!!! ) Smokers who read this comment, please feel okay? Thank you. 
0	The room is too old and too noisy. There is no hot water in the bathroom. It is recommended that Ctrip cancel and cooperate with it. Additional comment November 11, 2007: The service attitude is poor, the language is either too cold or cold, the room facilities are outdated. The bathroom is small. 
0	In my humble opinion, this restaurant is really nothing commendable, and it is even difficult to find a place to put a laptop! The computer was finally set up, but the power socket was not found. I was extremely depressed! Breakfast? Not to mention the deliciousness and variety, it is no exaggeration to say that even filling your stomach is a problem. If it doesn't work, you can try it! As other commentators have said, the messy phone calls continue to make you feel uneasy and terrible! The only good thing is the convenience of going to the airport. Advise you not to choose this hotel. 
1	The appearance is OK, and it's okay to play games under VISTA after 2 days. The heat is sometimes large and sometimes small, but I don't know why, but overall it is not very large. I bought a 4600 and gave it a gift. 
1	The environment is good and the room is very clean. The quality of the service staff is very good, the attitude is very good, and the checkout is fast. If the hotel staff can see this, it is recommended that the meal coupon can be reprinted. I was misled to the 4th floor during breakfast. A bit unhappy. 
0	The heat dissipation is poor. When the 2400XT is in standby mode, it is 60 degrees, and the CPU is 60 degrees. It is very hot. The speaker effect is too poor and the sound is too dry. This is the only thing that makes me dissatisfied. The memory is a single 1G, which needs to be upgraded to dual channel. 
0	Maybe because I am not working in a foreign company, this book did not resonate with me. It doesn't feel as attractive as the reviews on the Internet. It's just a bland reading after reading it. 
0	Quite bad! His city view room is by the street! Mountain view room is far away! It makes no difference! Poor service attitude! The original mountain view room was changed to a city view room without permission without a computer! 
0	Maybe Du Lala is a symbol of success, but if my friends around me are as vicious as Du Lala, it is difficult for me to get along with her. So I don’t understand why this book is so popular. The article contains Tao, what Tao is it this time? After all, what made her complacent was only the little bit of ambiguity that the long-haired foreigner had towards her. She traded this for some benefits, and couldn't help but ecstatic that she didn't have to trade her body. Her work style and attitude are similar to most women who work normally in the workplace. Who has never worked overtime in an empty office until the early hours of the morning? The only difference is that there are no long-haired devils in the big class room. 
1	The content inside is what parents have to experience in the process of educating their children, and they are very visible. It makes a lot of sense. Now I imitated a bit according to what was said inside, but the child liked it. Especially in this aspect of reading, my children always like to listen to me telling stories, and they have some basic reading skills. Now she has added Braille reading. After a few days of work, she also likes Braille reading. If I don't read the storybook firmly, she will find it strange. Ha ha! Very practical, there are good books worth thinking about every mother, 
0	I received an invoice number: 10342543 (amount of 3217 yuan) on June 5th. It belongs to the order number: 4491950. But today, the Finance Department can not pass the certification (the password area has a line in the password area is unclear). I really don’t know your company’s invoice. What did the clerk do! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	It’s light, with a gigabyte of memory as a gift, it’s really fast, it’s pretty good, and there’s no need to change to XP 
1	When I first bought it, I spent a few days reading this story before going to bed. From the beginning to the end, I felt worried. Very sad. I am distressed by Fang Hui's sensitivity. I have always guessed that she may be a Virgo who is pursuing perfection, and Chen Xun has always been considered by me to be an Aries, ha ha, just a guess. But after reading the whole book, I think I can think of a lot of my own stories. The people in the stories are very youthful, happy, and sad. The author uses a very delicate brushwork to describe the mood of many people. It's worth seeing. 
1	The small book is good, I bought it for 1699 yuan, and I think it is very affordable. The workmanship is good. I bought 3 sets with my colleagues. The pink is the best. 
1	I woke up in the morning and flipped through my son's book, but suddenly found two typos on pages 178 and 179. Suddenly feel uncomfortable. After reading the book, it has been printed five times in less than two years, which shows that it is still very popular. However, no small mistakes like editing can be seen, which also reflects the lack of rigor in the basic work of this book. (Morning supplement on April 5) 
1	The economy room was renovated later, it is smaller than the original room and only suitable for single person, because the bathroom is separated by frosted glass and there is no bathtub. 
1	Men love vixens, and women love them too. The fox Xiang Gong in the article is really coveted. It’s just that the storyline of the article is rather blunt at certain times, interspersed with many supernumerary topics that I think have nothing to do with the main line of the story. I think it’s because the author has too much to share with readers. However, the overall story narration is intermittent; and the processing of the emotional sublimation part is also rushed, which makes people occasionally feel inexplicable. But on the whole, this is a subject I like, and the description of the spirits in it is also very vivid, and it is an interesting book. 
1	A very good hotel, I will go there in the future! Convenient transportation, good service, good good 
1	International hotels have always been very good. I have stayed in many four-star hotels and I have always been most satisfied. The room rates are very reasonable, except for the toothbrush shampoo, the soap quality is very good, the room has a good view, the decoration and the color are very refreshing, and I am working I feel very comfortable when I return to this hotel room when I am busy. Recently, the hotel has changed to a new style of toothbrush. It feels not very good. The revolving restaurant on the 50th floor also has a good view. The bar on the fourth floor sells cigars, and the western food on the second floor has the middle Cheese, free parking. All the service staff are very professional and have a good attitude. I have lived in China as a foreigner for 10 years. Apart from toothbrushes, I feel it is the best hotel. 
1	"It looks very good, the keyboard ""looks"" and feels good, the heat dissipation of the machine is quite good, the screen is also very bright, it is something from HP... "
0	Too bad, the air conditioner is noisy and the facilities are not complete. How could Ctrip choose such a partner? 
0	The battery is not durable, the wireless is not turned on, the sound is not turned on, and the maximum brightness is not turned on. It can only be used for about 90 minutes. I don’t know if my case is the case. 
1	"Today I bought another book that I intend to give to my friends~~~~ I didn’t expect that my boyfriend also read Zeng Zihang’s book, and also reprinted an article in his space, called ""Three No Women Are Most Men’s Dreams"". Haha, I thought it was his own masterpiece at first, wondering when did he become so good in writing? Still thinking about the issue of men and women? It won't be a short run~~~~~ I asked, it turned out to be reprinted from Zeng Bo~~ Hee hee, don't worry! "
1	The best value is the 6-cell battery. Asus's quality is guaranteed and keyboard typing is comfortable. There is no feeling of shrinking. 
0	The piano paint is a fingerprint collector. I still like the previous matte surface. The computer does not have a system disk. It took a long time to repartition, and it feels that the machine is not very strong. 
1	Toshiba’s workmanship is good, but the heat dissipation is beautiful, but it didn’t say anything bad. The bottom of the screen was a little hot. I drove it for five or six hours, and there was nothing hot on the fuselage. It looks very comfortable 
1	It looks good. I went to see 6535 in the urban area when I chose it before. It is also a 3999 machine in Jingdong, but the appearance is much worse than that of CQ40, especially near the touchpad, and there is A side. The appearance of CQ40 is still good, although There is no internal film, but the general appearance is basically retained. 
1	The top double room, we got off the plane and took a bus, and we got there. The outside of the hotel is not very young, the inside is good, the air-conditioning is sufficient, the inside of the room is also good, the overall feeling is good, the opposite is the seafood street, which one eats well Yes, I can’t walk for 200 yuan for 2 people. Haha, the hotel has a shuttle bus directly to Hong Kong, not bad. 
0	It is estimated to be the worst hotel in the hotel I stayed on a business trip this month. It can be said that it is not as good as home. The price is 328, breakfast is included, and it is given to the 9th floor. When you open the elevator, you know it’s wrong, dirty carpet , The door of the room is tattered and can't be opened yet, withdraw! The person at the front desk below asked what was wrong. Later, I was going to upgrade to a superior room. Let’s take a look. Oh, it’s still bad, but it’s almost 6 o’clock and the road is snowing again. There are other things to do, so I’ll do it at night. When I came back, the toilet was leaking or hot. I sat on it, steaming and wet buttocks. For the first time, the bathroom was very ordinary, the old hotel with toothless teeth, and I especially hate the waiter at the front desk. I don’t dare to serve in the future. If you stay at this hotel again, the Ctrip operator will say that it is a good star hotel, and you know you are cheating money 
1	Funds are the same as all investment projects, and they must first understand before they can grasp the scale, and will not follow the trend and cause losses. This book about fund introduction is a good choice. It does not emphasize concepts like general books. Although it also involves concepts, the author uses his own way to interpret it so that people who are new to the fund can better understand it. The content popularizes many concepts of the fund in a very easy-to-understand language like the public. For ordinary citizens, in order to gain something, they must understand many situations in the fund industry and will not blindly follow the trend when it is critical. For novices, it is highly recommended. 
0	There are not many words and the pictures are wonderful. I personally think it is more suitable for younger children, such as first grade or preschool children, but the words do not have pinyin, which restricts children's reading. The quality of the book is not bad. 
0	It was shown on August 6th that my order was processed. It has been half a month and I haven't got the book yet. When will I get it? I hope you can be supervised! 
1	Perfect screen, good sound, good game performance, good heat dissipation. Hard disk can hardly hear sound. 
0	The book review said it was very good. The little niece didn't read it, and even the colorful pictures in it didn't attract her. I don't know if children don't like learning, or books are not suitable for Chinese children, Khan! ! ! ! 
1	I have read a book with a similar title and thought that the content of these books should be roughly the same. I didn’t expect to turn it over. Although the few pages are thin, the teaching methods are all aimed at young children, how to use some figurative language in education, which inspired me very much (because other books mostly teach piano skills. Lord); even mentioned how parents of piano boys should better guide their children, cooperate with teachers, and improve their musical quality and sense of responsibility. Teacher Li Feilan is indeed a piano educator! These insights help us cultivate children's interest in piano since childhood. 
0	The front desk service of the hotel is poor and the guests are not warm. Claimed that Ctrip has no reservations. It feels that the guests are begging for them, and we must live. This hotel will not stay next time! 
1	The hotel is more convenient to go to the development zone, which is far from the city. The hotel's services and facilities are very good. What is super cute is the electronically controlled toilet in the bathroom. Although there is no drying function, the Chinese can also use other functions. Foreigners dare not use it because the signs are all in Chinese. The Japanese restaurant on the first floor tastes first-rate, praise~~ I don’t know why the business is not so good. Overall, this hotel is very good, and the company's foreigners are quite satisfied. Hotel feedback January 9, 2008: Hello! On behalf of all the colleagues of Yinfan Tianzhichuan Japanese Restaurant, I would like to express my gratitude! After the installation and use of Yinfan's electronically controlled toilet, it is deeply loved by customers! However, foreign guests, especially Japanese guests, can use this new technology more skillfully because their country has already used this new technology. Yinfan’s Japanese restaurant started to be renovated on January 10, 2008, and opened for business. At present, a huge advertising campaign is underway. I believe our future will be better! 
1	From Tianya to the publication of this book, although it took a lot of time to wait, it was very worthwhile. In the vicissitudes of life, many of us have become accustomed to modern hospitals and all the doctrines of Western medicine, but we have gradually forgotten what our ancestors left us. I am very happy that Dr. Luo Dalun has used a special perspective to describe the great doctors who have made great contributions to our medical career. Let us not only understand their medical ethics, but also understand some basic knowledge of Chinese medicine, and more importantly, what talent Is the real doctor! ! ! Absolutely good book, worth collecting! ! ! ! 
0	To be honest, this hotel is relatively poor. I checked the address of the hotel in advance when I went to Tianjin. Frante is near the airport bus terminal, so I chose it but I was disappointed afterwards. The room is small and it is still a wooden loft. Yes, it was very noisy (does not rule out the reason for the special room). At that time, the weather was still relatively cold, and the bath water in the bathroom was cold. The waiter said that more water was needed, so it didn't get much hot after 10 minutes. I heard that the hotels in Tianjin are not very good, so I insisted on staying here for two nights. Later, I went to the Friendship House opposite to see my friends and found that it was very good. On the last night in Tianjin, I chose there, cheaper than Fulante, and the environment is good, the rooms are large, the bathroom facilities are good, and the service is good. Personal experience, objective evaluation, hope the hotel can improve. . . 
1	Type AB people seem very confused. Many times they don’t know what they are thinking. This blood type manual allows readers to understand the inner world of type AB people from a different perspective, so as to understand the living conditions of this group of minorities. I I am an AB person. Most of the time, I am pretentious and extremely inferior in some respects. Many small details and small actions in life are very close to the instructions described above. It is very magical. This is not the fate and numerology. Kind of book. But it is a good way to understand yourself or type AB people. 
1	I read it with a plea for help. Unlike what many people say, don’t rush to finish it and then put it on the shelf. I finished reading the story in one breath. Rarely picked up afterwards. I do need a relatively long time to pick up and read again. I thought I basically found the answer after reading it. In fact, I can't even answer the first question for myself. . . . . . It helped me open a whole new world. I broke in and hurriedly watched it again and then slipped out. It seems to understand something, but it seems to get nothing. I will get it, this is just the beginning. 
0	Don’t live in the room in the side building, the room is too bad, and cockroaches were found in the bathroom, the price is not cheap, very uncomfortable, the room in the main building is OK 
1	Friends are quite satisfied with the evaluation of the hotel, but the traffic is very congested. It takes a long time to enter and exit each time. 
0	Check-in time: 2008.5.14 Location: relatively close to the scenic spot, relatively close to the highway, good location service attitude: very general Hotel environment: completely not up to its star standards, the reception hall is acceptable, dirty after entering Chaotic guest room environment: outdated floor, broken furniture, bathroom equipment not working, etc. Service attitude: very average, not enthusiastic, casual Breakfast situation: very poor, smorgasbord, no buffet, either pickles or kimchi, either steamed buns or stale steamed buns Surrounding environment: very noisy at night, there is no waiter, the shouting of guests 
0	When I bought it, I read the reviews and said it was good, but only after I bought it, I didn’t show it to my child. I think she might not like it. 
1	The price is affordable, basically OK. Hotel feedback April 17, 2008: I hope to stay at this hotel again next time. 
0	Both this hotel and Qufu left an unforgettable impression-rubbish! ! I advise you to never go there again, so you don't have time to regret it! The overall impression is: regardless of hotels, shops, transportation or tourist attractions, in addition to the charges have been in line with international standards, the other is the level of old, young, and border areas! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Sad, the hometown of Master Confucius who is famous for advocating benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, perfection and faith 
1	The screen has no dead or dark spots, which is pretty good. The configuration is cost-effective. It has been used for half a month and is basically normal. 
1	The service is very good, I hope it’s not just in time for the Olympics. There are people leading the way everywhere. You feel at home! The breakfast is fairly rich, and there are many restaurants at the door. The beach is just outside. The scenery is beautiful. Worth staying! 
1	Ensure the smoothness of the game: mid-definition running pes2009, low-definition running Call of Duty 5, high-definition running Spore 
1	The size is moderate and the color is bright. The performance is pretty good, and the current configuration of the same size netbook is relatively high. The speed is also very fast. 
1	Not bad after renovation, the room is clean and the double bed room is very comfortable. Printing is expensive 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the sound quality is good, watching movies is cool, the keyboard is good, and the vista system is being explored 
1	Yesterday, my friend helped me to sign for the notebook, but I finally touched it today. I tried to test a few, and there was no big problem. The hanging heart was finally relieved. The overall feeling is pretty good. 
0	I feel that the author's views are completely opposite to my own, and it is difficult to agree with the author's views! There may be cultural and regional differences! I bought more than a dozen books, and I think this book is the most useless. A waste of money! 
0	I have never seen such a small room. If two people walk around in the room, they need to let them go. The attitude of the hotel staff is cold. I have never seen them laugh or greet you actively. The distance from the subway Dongchong line is not bad. The surrounding environment of the hotel is not very good. It is a residential area (of course not where the rich live). If I go next time, I will definitely not stay here again and I don’t recommend it 
0	The location is very good, the rooms and facilities are very old. Service 1*. I also experienced the front desk clerk at checkout. Additional comment December 9, 2007: Why didn’t Ctrip develop the opposite Shangri-La as a partner? Next time I go to Shangri-La , It may be decided through Yilong.com. 
0	Access denied when partitioning, no matter how to partition, please help! How to install the 1G memory sticks? You should not be able to install it yourself 
0	Room facilities are relatively simple. The waiter service is also average, with poor sound insulation. The harassment call at night, oh, don’t mention it 
1	Call to book the first four days of the Spring Festival, standard room 338 yuan, including double breakfast. Arrive at the hotel at 11 o'clock on the first night of the first day of the new year and upgrade to a business room for free because the room is full The room was clean. Near the subway station. I took a taxi only once, and took a taxi from Xidan Civil Aviation Bus Station to the hotel for 13 yuan. It takes less than an hour to ikea. But now hotel room rates are increasing, if the price is right, it is worth choosing. 
0	I ordered this book through the introduction on the Internet, but after reading a few pages, I felt a kind of foolish feeling. The introduction on the Internet was a big overstatement, and the content in the book was very boring and not interesting at all. Sex can be discussed, even someone like me who loves English can't read it, let alone the elderly and children. However, the quality of the book is very good. 
1	Very average five-star hotel, the surrounding environment feels messy 
1	First of all, the service is very good. The service level in the south is generally higher than that in the north. It makes people feel at home. There was a girl at the elevator asking about the floor to go to. She thought it was the elevator to welcome the guests, and then recommended to the entertainment floor. Good impression. The hardware is very ordinary, just like Samsung. Breakfast is average, and Ctrip's 30 yuan is not particularly cheap. 
0	I took my child. The TV screen was unsightly when I turned it on. I was afraid that my child would press it, so I had to hide the remote control. How can a five-star hotel be like a street hotel? The hotel should reflect on it. 
1	Very good book! Because of the school’s book exchange activities, my son changed the book to someone else, but unfortunately, before he finished reading it, others urged him to return it. The child was very reluctant, but other people urged me very tightly. The child told me that I would copy it. Right! I like the look very much, I ordered it on Dangdang. The delivery is fast and the quality is good. The most important thing is that the children love it! I finished reading it all night, and it was really good. After reading it, I recalled my first grade, and it seemed to be like this... I was just thinking why the author didn’t publish a second grade book, and the child was in second grade right away, and then I wrote it ^- ^ Looking forward to... 
1	The delivery speed and service of the book are very good! The packaging of the book is also very good, it is a hardcover book wrapped in plastic film, thank you Dangdang staff! This book records one strange case after another in the form of chapters. In fact, what lies behind the strange cases is the ugliness and evil of human nature. It is a very beautiful book. After reading it, it is really not enough. If There is a sequel, I will buy it again! Highly recommended, like the atmosphere of suspense thriller and criminal case together! 
1	The fruit was very good, the room was average, nothing special, but the breakfast was awful 
1	I have seen a lot of reviews before I bought it, and I have used EeePC's previous generation 10-inch notebook, so after seeing its battery evaluation, it is it! Samsung NC10 battery is comparable to it, but the price is not comparable, 400 yuan more expensive than it! After a few days of use, I mainly lie in bed and watch the web and watch American TV series. After a night, there is still battery power. Disable its touchpad, coupled with the Pennefather 7100 wireless mouse that I bought, hehe, it can only be described in two words: ease! 
0	It is very depressing that the c drive is not partitioned. I transferred the things from the old computer to the notebook. As a result, I used more than 20G of space and there was no way to back it up. 
0	Look at the reviews of SL500 (2746-CA2), I don’t dare to change the system; A side feels a bit cheap, considering the price of the whole machine is acceptable; the other is that the delivery is too few, and the most practical memory and mouse None of it. . . 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the color is very favorite, the configuration is balanced, the interface is rich, and the price is good. It has a camera and microphone for direct video chat; it has a card reader and is compatible with xD cards. The keyboard is super large, it will be relatively convenient to use. 
0	"Insufficient power battery life. It took too long to use the check, and it took more than a week. For advanced customers, we should use ""Pay the check and pick up the spot"". Don't give the goods only when they arrive at the account. "
1	Cost-effective, LED screens are more power-saving, and the configuration is good at the same price. Compatibility is good, both Transcend and Kingston memory can be used. 
1	"I first met Zhang Manjuan on the CD of Zhang Qingfang as a lyricist. The delicate words and even the lyrics are like love letters. Later I learned that Zhang Manjuan was also a writer. So I started planning to read her book and picked this very strange name. ""Zhang Manjuan Monsters""-writing about monsters and people-I like ""Eternal Lost│ Female Conch"" most. Zhang Manjuan's text does not speak of great principles, but leaves room for thinking. ""Maybe it's unknown; maybe it's sealed as a secret; maybe you don't want to admit that the monster lives in your heart."" "
1	I believe that the ibm product has good performance and good screen. It is lighter than the original company's Dell D610. So some people say that the SL400 is heavier. I don't think it is enough for office and general entertainment. 
1	"It was originally used as an exam reference book, but after reading it, I found that the value is not there. As far as the exam books are concerned, it is obviously not as refined as the history of Chinese aesthetics by Mr. Ye Lang, but as a reader for deepening traditional Chinese aesthetics, it is a very good book. Mr. Chen Wangheng is worthy of being a contemporary leader in ""realm aesthetics"", Of the three parts, I have benefited the most from the source of the category of ""Yijing"" in Chinese classical aesthetics. Recommend this book as a collection, very good, whether it is for Chinese studies or design, it is of great reference value and learning value~~ "
1	The price is cheap, the configuration is very sufficient, what kind of dual-core, large memory, large hard disk, wireless. Open it and see, the screen is perfect. 
1	Apart from being close to the airport, there is nothing to say. There should be no 5 stars. 
1	Older hotels, better service, not many breakfast varieties. But it is very convenient to go to the beach. 
1	There is a common sensational behavior. When describing a trend, a certain curve is infinitely enlarged. As the ordinate unit becomes smaller and smaller, the slope of the curve becomes larger, causing a visual impact. In fact, the rate of change is often only one percentage point. Today's media prefer this method very much. I don't know if they don't understand or deliberately twist it. Needless to say, the confusion between correlation and causality is the most classic example of the relationship between the growth rate of the US economy and the length of women’s skirts on the streets of Paris. Read this book, and reflect on what you have seen and heard in life with surprise and laughter. 
1	Garden-style hotel, in the city, a bit old, but the rooms by the garden are nice! 
0	The six-cell battery protrudes one piece, which affects the appearance; the weight is slightly heavier than the general netbook; the touchpad is not sensitive, and the left and right buttons are not suitable; no accessories (mouse, bag); the price is slightly higher 
1	The screen is good, and I installed the V system directly for fear of trouble, which is not bad! The battery is about 3 hours, and there are several power saving modes to choose from! 
1	Lightweight, suitable for ladies and business people. Think’s word of mouth is there. The keyboard is full-size, suitable for anyone. 
1	I read this book with a very elegant attitude. I was a little disappointed when I saw it halfway through. I felt that the writing was not as comprehensive as I had hoped. But when I read it patiently, I feel that just a cursory browsing is not enough. After reading the whole book, I have the desire to read it again. I like essential oils and the calming power. In fact, I have been exposed to essential oils 8 years ago, but I have never been immersed in it like I am now. In fact, happiness is not measured by money and status. As long as you have a contented and grateful heart, you can be happy every day. 
1	First of all, the price/performance ratio is good. There are no dead pixels on the screen after receiving the goods. The temperature control of the cooling base can be lowered by about 12 degrees on average. It does not generate much heat without running large programs. The various interfaces are relatively complete. If you do not know a little professional knowledge when installing the system, it is very It is difficult to install. First, after booting, press F2 to enter the BIOS according to the prompt, change the mode under MAIN to IDE interface, and then change the startup item to CD-ROM boot, delete the pre-installed system before installing XP, basically the GHOST version of the system is installed No, you can only install it with the installation disk. 
1	Consistent excellent heat dissipation performance. It hasn’t been long before. The company has already bought two sets in front of me. I think one is for heat dissipation, the other is for one-key recovery, and the third is that the skin is durable and stable. These few things prompted me to buy this one again. 
1	I received the goods in the afternoon, but I didn’t rest until 11pm because of overtime. After a day of tiredness, I wandered on the bed and couldn't wait to open the package of the book. What was displayed in front of me was a book that was exquisite like a work of art, and a variety of food exhibitions were presented before my eyes. In one sigh, I read it all over, clipped my favorite dishes with a note, and prepared to practice. What I particularly like is the words that the editors wrote on the top of the recipes that have a sense of romantic life. Good food should also have a good life appreciation feeling to set off! The wonderful Beitai kitchen makes me want to try it too if I don’t want to go to the kitchen. 
1	"The themes of this series of books, such as ""Talking about Kangxi"" and ""Talking about Yongzheng"" are very attractive to me. I tried to download some videos of Teacher Ji from ""Cultural China"" on the Internet, but I still feel that reading is more enjoyable. However, it has to be said that the publishing house is not serious enough in the proofreading. Following a mistake in ""Said Kangxi"" in pacifying the beginning and end of San Francisco, the age of Jierhalang and Dorgon in the second paragraph of page 114 of this book The difference is 13 years old, but the article says it is 3 years old. In addition, after reading this series of books, I found that ""Said Kangxi"" and ""Said Xiaozhuang"" had too much repetition in content. Some paragraphs are even word-for-word, and there is a suspicion of making up the word count. "
1	The system is easy to install, the LED screen is good, that is, the ratio of 16 to 9 looks longer, and it is a 14.0 screen. The appearance is cool, suitable for young people, the keyboard imitates SONY, not bad. 
1	I just came back from Haitian and lived in the standard room on the 15th floor of the East Building. The windows are very large. Sitting by the window, facing the left is the sea view, and the right is the mountain view. The Haitian Hotel is sandwiched between Donghai Road and Hong Kong West Road. The scenery is very beautiful Not bad. If you choose to live near Hong Kong Road, this one is undoubtedly the most beautiful view outside the window. The bed and pillows are quite comfortable, the toilet is a bit old, but the hot water is very stable, and it can be opened (Is it a five-star hotel? Good!) The 15% service fee is a bit expensive. When you check in, you go to find your own room, and no one takes care of your luggage. This is a bit of a shame for the expensive service fee. The doorman called TAXI to start. It costs 10+1 yuan, and it is recommended that you do not sit. Walk a few steps by yourself to call on the street, the starting fee is 8 yuan. The TV is a bit smaller, about 18 inches. Two biscuits and a small wild flower will be given the night before leaving. . . Haha, the food in the hotel is not expensive, but the service charge of +15% is a bit. . . . . . Overall it is a very good choice. It is very convenient to go to various attractions. The airport bus runs every half an hour at the back door of the hotel. It is fine to watch the sea in a daze in the room, 700 yuan a night. 
1	At the daughter's repeated request, she decided to buy an abacus to play with her, so that she could feel the feel of the abacus and the fun in it.. Just because I can't remember the dialing method of the abacus, I am afraid to mislead my daughter, so I bought this book. There are many books on abacus and mental arithmetic on the Internet. It is not easy to choose the right one. I entered the process of understanding with my daughter with the mentality of trying it out... The children who come into contact with abacus, the daughter likes it very much, and she is willing to watch the pictures and practice page by page. Seeing her daughter's self-narcissism, the whole family is very happy. 
0	The linux system has never been played before, and the D side is slightly lacking in workmanship and has a strong plastic feel. But worth the price. 
1	Living before New Year's Day, the Sichuan girl has a strong sense of service and is very careful. Ask one answer two three, think ahead of the guests. The room is a bit old, but the bath and air-conditioning are OK. It's a pity that the hot spring didn't take a bath, but friends who took it said it was good. I went to squeeze my feet, the technique is very good, I like it. 
1	1. The piano is painted on the outside, and the keyboard is surrounded by alloy and recessed settings, so it is very beautiful! 2. High cost performance! 3. Altec Lansing sound quality is very good! 
0	The screen is a bit smaller, and you have to install the system yourself, which is more troublesome for those who don’t know how to do it, and you have to go to the computer company to reinstall it for 30 yuan. 
1	It’s been almost a month since I left the hotel, but I still want to say a few words: When I arrived it was very late, I had dinner at the restaurant in the store. By the way, I asked if I could have breakfast at five o’clock the next day. The waiter kindly told me Although the restaurant hadn't opened at that time, they could arrange delivery to the room. At 5:35 the next morning, the rich breakfast was delivered to the room, and I apologized for being five minutes late. I am so touched! Although it was only a short night, I can clearly feel that the store staff are working hard! Encourage! 
0	From the trivial things, it’s not like a four-star hotel: the doorman seems invisible when the car reaches the door, and talks to himself. There is no even the door, the breakfast variety is few, and the room facilities are not as good as Samsung. But this hotel is considered the best in Yixian, if you want to stay, you can only use it 
1	I think this book is worthy of taste. Through reading, first of all, we can avoid these mistakes in our future work; second, we can easily see through these tricks; finally, we should pay special attention to professional ethics. In this field, we must at least maintain our own purity, and never use our expertise to lie or do some negative things. The development of statistics in China is so slow that a large number of principled professionals are needed. My belief is to start from myself and contribute my meager strength to the statistical cause of the motherland. 
0	The machine heats up slightly and is thicker. . . In addition, it is unbearable that express delivery is slower than surface mail. Things were sent out on Monday. After a long week, they finally climbed from Guangzhou to Shenzhen (a 2-hour journey). This tortoise China Post Logistics. In the past, Yuantong bought on Monday and could be there on Tuesday. Now I dare not buy anything on JD.com 
1	The big brand, the hardware configuration is very good, the system is changed to xp, and it runs fast without adding memory! Suitable for our Mimi Shao brother. 
1	Advantages: The room hardware is good, brand new and modern; although the house itself is old, the old house is tall and spacious. Disadvantages: The price is actually small and expensive; the room is slightly crowded; the broadband charge is 10 yuan and the network cable needs to be actively obtained; breakfast is not included; the pick-up is OK but not sent, although the guests have a lot of luggage. Reference: The hotel offers 100 yuan for a standard room for frequent residents, and 320 yuan for a direct check-in room, and a discount of 350 yuan for the remaining suite when we check in at night. There are at least 4 lodgings near the airport. If you want to find a better discount, there are several hotel/guest houses near the airport when you leave the airport and wait to pick up your luggage. The cheapest airport guest house is only tens of yuan. . 
0	This set of cats and mice was originally intended to be given to friends, but more than ten sets were delivered for the first time. Every one of them was well packaged and the quality was problematic. According to the delivery, it is more troublesome to exchange the goods. It is better to return the goods directly and place the order again. This is repeated several times, but the quantity I want has not been delivered. No way to complain! ! ! ! Sadly! ! ! ! But in general, this set of discs can only be said to be of high quality and low price. After reading it, it is found that it is not genuine and the image quality is average. Give it to you to think clearly! 
1	"This book interprets the relationship between commitment and responsibility from a male perspective. From Duffy's dazedness at the beginning to the courage to face his sincerity and promise to Mel's marriage. The whole story seems to be very organized, the author's insight from male vision and the description of mental activities are very vivid. Although I feel that the final touch of Mel's pregnancy is a bit of a finishing touch, this story always runs through the word ""promise"". Mike Gayle's book always makes people feel happy after reading. His book allows women to understand the world of men's thoughts, which is evocative. "
0	I don't like the works of this kind of subject matter, it is too heavy. A lot of it is related to personal preference. I don't like the work of rural subjects. The reality is too cruel and unbearable. 
0	Easy to stick fingerprints! ! ! CD-ROM read disk ring! ! ! There is debris in the screen (a small black spot, not a dead spot), let alone an example, it is acceptable 
1	I found a lot of typos...maybe the new input method is not suitable for it, maybe it's because I am too excited and self-reflection... 
0	If you don’t know how to install the system, you will feel a headache. You have to change it in the bios, and the hard disk type is IDE for normal installation. 
0	The maximum sound is still a bit small. The memory is a bit small and you need to add it yourself, but it seems that the memory and compatibility are good. I installed Apacer, and there is no problem. 
0	In summary, the point of view is not bad. But the sentence is too long and protracted, and a question is repeated N times with the same sentence. 
0	The touchpad is too small to use, the 6-cell battery is too large and heavy, and the notebook can’t be placed flat (so I plan to buy a 3-cell battery), the mirror screen is reflective, vista is not a business version, and there is no gift. Zhongtong Express is too low It's too slow, it is recommended not to save postage. 
1	My daughter is six and a half years old, and she reads a little bit shallowly, so she will finish her reading in a while and put it aside. But I find that she often turns up. My colleague saw me buying this book, took it immediately, and sighed as he read it: My daughter (four years old) must like the picture on it, and at the same time it cultivated her interest in mathematics. So he immediately ordered a set. Very good book. If I don’t receive such an easy and interesting mathematics enlightenment education from time to time, I won’t let the boredom of mathematics grow up with me, so that I will go to college and make up the exam for high maths. 
1	I hope everyone can try to stay in every hotel like me, because every hotel has its own characteristics 
0	It’s even better if the memory is DDR3~ Jingdong’s courier knocked on the door. . . And it’s not fair to customers that they won’t inspect the goods without signing 
1	The rooms of the Horizon Club are quite different from the ordinary guest rooms. The ordinary guest rooms are quite outdated. It is often heard that foreign guests experience free upgrades to the room, but the Chinese have never encountered it! 
1	The hotel recommended by a friend, the location is good, the traffic is very convenient, and the hotel’s service is also very considerate. When checking in, a glass of ice lemon tea is delivered at the front desk, which makes people feel the hotel’s attentive service. On summer nights, sit in the outdoor beer garden and drink Drinking beer and chatting with friends is very pleasant. 
0	It's boring, it's okay to show to elementary students. The story and language are not good. It is similar to the English learning card used in childhood, but it is not as beautiful as the English learning card. 
1	The location is good, but the facilities are very old. Others are also ok. I saw someone above said that I can make long-distance calls for free, but I made two local calls, and I also charged 2 yuan for local calls when I checked out. 
1	"It's because our city's book month recommended this book that I paid attention to. The quality of the book is very good and exquisite. Of course there are very few discounts. I checked it first and found that when I was a child, I had seen a comic strip adapted from this book, which seemed to be called ""Ba School"". I didn't particularly like it at the time, but it felt like the author was making up a story. But my daughter likes this novel very much and will read it every day. She has to tell me what she thinks is interesting. worth buying. In addition, children watch the excitement of this book, and adults watch the doorway. There will be gains. "

1	The book is very delicate. After all, the author is a professional, and he has unique ideas in cultivating children's artistic feelings. Although I still don't understand the appreciation of children's works in it, I agree with some of the author's views. I used to enroll my child in an art class and thought everything was ok. After reading the book and gaining something, I have already started to take my child to see art exhibitions, listen to music, watch children’s dramas, visit modern art exhibitions, etc. The series are interlinked. Very good book. If the author runs a children's art tutoring class, I will definitely take the children! 
1	I stayed on the first day of the New Year in a standard sea view room in the West Building. The hotel is relatively old and the room is very small. The strange thing is that it is too hot without the air conditioner. The west building is the first phase, the east building is the second phase, but the west building is closer to the sea. Sea view standard rooms are on both sides of the building, so you need to look sideways to see the sea view, which is a bit tired. But it is the old five-star, the service efficiency is very high, everything is delivered quickly, and the waiters at the hotel counter are very courteous and polite. I took the booking form of Ctrip with me so that I could watch the flight time, but when I checked in, I forgot to check in the counter. I called the counter that night to keep it for me, but turned around and forgot. Four days later, when I was about to fly, I remembered that I was still there when I hit the counter. About five minutes later, my brother sent me a delivery. I was very happy. Another point, we had a breakfast in the cafe of the hotel. The lady was lovely, but the black pepper beef that we waited so hard was salty. I don't know if it's the locals' taste or our bad luck. 
1	After reading this book in one day, the whole body is filled with the warm light of happiness. A book written by a person who has a say in the field of picture books with soft and sweet words, simple words outline the taste of happiness . What is the meaning of picture books and how to choose picture books for my children. I am not married yet, and I can still feel that kind of happiness. The text in the book reminds me of my mother. The good time we spent together, I can still enjoy I have been working hard on the road to find happiness, I am happy and feel the beauty of those lives! Thanks to those who love each other! Thank you Mr. Matsui Nao! 
1	"Mr. Jin did a good job, but I found a lot of mistakes, haha. Do your studies with skepticism. For example, Mr. Jin’s explanation of singing white face and red face in the book is wrong. According to the Peking opera, it is a red loyal and white traitor; singing white face is Play the villain, and Mr. Jin wrote the opposite. Another example: Better half can be used to describe a wife in a joke, and Mr. Jin has written it as Bitter half. There was also Mr. Jin who left the ""Analects"" when he was writing the ""Four Books"". I counted for a long time, and there were only three books... Although there are some errors, readers can look at it dialectically if they are attentive. "
0	"Yu Dan’s ""The Analects of Confucius"" experience (highly recommended by Yi Zhongtian's preface) First of all, I don’t think Yi Zhongtian really wanted to write a preface to Yu Dan’s book. From that article, I can’t feel that he has any admiration for this book, but it’s just not good. I wrote it off, after all, I started with the same show. Secondly, the content of this book is on the surface the experience of writing the Analects, and the content is just using the Analects as an introduction, telling some irrelevant words, and interspersed with short stories that do not fit the theme. A little bit of suspicion of selling dog meat. Yu Dan played well when she was doing the show. This is a must-have skill for her career as a professor. You can quote from others and make the Analects attractive enough, but if you really get this book for scrutiny, it will really not stand up to it. You can take a closer look. Anyway, I have read many stories on the Internet, and I know the theme, but Comrade Yu Dan's experience in the Analects seems to be far from the theme. But one thing is certain. She made the Analects civilians and let more people pay attention to it, which is consistent with the purpose of Baijia Forum. Since it is ""experience"", there is nothing wrong with it. I am not saying that I have to translate the Analects sentence by sentence into an obscure professional essay, so that it is impossible to communicate with the people. Therefore, the Analects is easy to understand, and it is close to the public. The achievement may be here. Professors sometimes fool people, so please accept it critically. "
1	Walk through the fog of the red wall of history, listen to the rhythm of the pulse of the great poets, feel the temperature of the century's sincere and innocence, and enjoy the joy of good books and beautiful essays! 
1	Shao Zhiyong's entry into the screen and becoming the leading actor is only a momentary affirmation. It is a pity that his past is colorful and does not require her participation; his future will be interesting, even without her participation. And her? There is only one Dahong certificate on the bottom of the box. If her feelings are, it would not be appropriate to put it in the end. But Jiuli definitely doesn't need to use pity to describe her, she has her own thoughts and love has her own personality. Even if she has gone all the way in exchange for the presence of another woman, she still needs to cry exaggeratedly to leave. Sitting in front of the window, she was crying silently, this is her world, the world where one person lives! 
0	It is very troublesome to install the system. It will not start when installing with GHOST disk. What GRUB appears, and then I get the installation disk. But in the dead of night, as long as I operate the computer, I hear the sound of the hard drive. I wonder if it is normal? 
0	I placed an order and paid. The order is out of stock. The price has been reduced by 100 yuan when it arrives again. I have not been notified and there is no refund. I don’t know how to solve it? 
1	Perfect screen, good delivery speed. I bought one for my dad and didn't change the vista, it felt okay. The keyboard feels good and the buttons are large and comfortable. The fan sound is so small that it can basically be ignored. Good heat dissipation 
1	It took me two breaths to finish reading the book, sacrificing the two hours after midnight and the more than one hour of nap. I don't seem to have any impression of the workplace skills and perceptions in the book, but the work of the marketing department makes me full of curiosity. Also, a question that I have been thinking about these past two days, that is, what dreams I have, seems to be more in need of thinking. Then, I thought, ah, when I was young, why didn't I know that Peking University was so good, otherwise I would have to pass the exam if I tried to suckle. Compared with Mia, it turns out that my friends and girlfriends are so few.

1	Combining with the general history of China will benefit a lot, and let your vision exaggerate from your own country to the entire human history of the world. After reading, I felt that we were a little too proud in the past. We always think that there are four great inventions leading the world for a long time. In fact, this is not the case. We should be humble. In the eyes of Westerners, modern Japan is more successful than China in Asian countries, defeating the Russians for the first time and winning the victory of modern Asia over Europe. We should reflect carefully, learn from the success factors of Europe and America, understand the shortcomings of our nation, and contribute to China's rise again in the future. 
1	Because I checked Ctrip's reviews before, I didn't expect much of this hotel. But after moving in, it feels okay overall. Although there is still a gap between five-star ratings, it should be acceptable in Jilin. There seemed to be no suitable restaurants around the hotel. Finally, I had a Brazilian barbecue buffet at the hotel, which was 88 yuan more expensive than other places, and the level was average. Another is that the bathroom is really small. 
1	The one I bought in 1999 is really cheap, the workmanship is good, and I am satisfied after a few days. Not worse than the 3999 dell netbook of acquaintances. 
0	It is very different from expectations, and it feels a bit unrealistic. Many opinions are not persuasive and hard to resonate. 
0	I got a headache when I installed XP, but I still didn't succeed, so I gave up! It's better to install vista and make do with it, it will be fine if you get used to it! 
0	Room equipment is relatively outdated, not five-star standard, guests are very dissatisfied 
1	Very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good 
0	There are too few accessories. I bought a high-end version, which has one mainframe, one power supply, and a bigger one, no more. Without a mouse, an inner bag, not to mention outsourcing, don't even think about wiping, it should be equipped with a standard battery. 
0	At least I didn't find it good-looking, it didn't appeal to me at all, there was nothing ridiculous, some words were very profound. The printing of the book is very good, the content is not well introduced. 
0	Without a camera, the driver of the wireless network card has to be downloaded from the official website, which is more inconvenient. I hope this aspect is more user-friendly. 
1	The geographical position is superior, and it is convenient to go everywhere. The room is relatively small, but the view and hygiene are good. Very quiet, surrounded by old residential areas, quite distinctive. Service attitude is good. I should choose here next time I go! 
1	A very good book. It can be seen that a great person cares for his family in his heart. From this, he can also learn from his self-discipline, self-denial, self-discipline, and his earnest hope and strict requirements for his family. How can such a patriarch who leads by example and strict requirements not cultivate excellent children? It really makes our current parents look forward to it, and it is worth studying and reflecting. Classics are classics, there are more books than people write now. Each family letter is short, concise and concise, and at the same time very easy to read. There are almost no obstacles to reading ancient Chinese. I like it very much. 
1	Dinosaurs, although few look good, but many children just love to watch them. Dinosaur Land is a set, but I'm not sure if the three-and-a-half-year-old child likes it, so I bought one first. As a result, children are crazy about it. You can tell this story continuously all night. Moreover, the baby listens carefully every time. After a few days, the children will be able to repeat the whole book decently. Seeing she likes it so much, I bought another set. The children look forward to it every day. The storyline is very simple, but for a three and a half year old baby, it still feels very exciting. Nice picture book. 
1	"After reading ""Thousand Mountains"", the meaning is still not enough. The story is not over yet, this is the idea I have as soon as I read it. I strongly urge the bandit to write a sequel, I think this is not my own idea. Because the story of ""Mo Sheng"" still has a lot of room for imagination and a lot of unexplained plots, watching ""Thousand Mountains"" is the one that I shed the least tears, less than Jingnian's, which proves that this book hasn't To ""play meat"". So even if you are not sure about the sequel, you can at least write a few translations to satisfy us. "
1	It's really a good book that makes people pick it up and don't put it down. The language is easy to understand, and there is nothing that makes people feel obscure. After reading it, it feels shocking and can't wait to promote it to the family. It turns out that the beautiful foods that we saw under the colorful packaging have so many inside stories. Carefully jot down the bits and pieces in the book so that I understand how to choose healthy food calmly and objectively, and try to avoid taking junk food home. Since then, I will pay more attention to the food ingredient list when I buy things again. It is really clear to shop! 
0	My family stayed on June 7th and Out on the 8th. I was very dissatisfied with the full glass shower room and the movements of the people inside. It was clear that I had to walk out of the sink after taking a shower and put on clothes. There are more than ten children The age is embarrassing, and the toilets are extremely small. The most infuriating hotel is a five-star hotel. The five-star fee but the product brand is far below the standard (referring to sanitary ware, faucet, hardware) . Special reminder to the residents of the room on the parking lot, remember to draw the curtains when you go to the toilet, don't think it is from reflective glass, your beauty inside is really heart-pounding! ! ! 
0	I don't like the VISTA system very much, which is annoying. I reinstalled the system myself, and found that the drivers were all VISTA, which caused me to restore to VISTA with one click. 
1	The book is well-bound, suitable for family collection and reading. It would be great to understand a person through his letters, and it is a family letter, and to understand this person also understand more about that era and that society, and give us modern people a little inspiration. And I also learned about his study habits, methods and aspects of teaching children. More rewarding. The cover is soft and hardcover. It would be better if the cover had the photo of each teacher. It is divided into two volumes for easy reading. The fonts inside are different: the letter is in teacher Qi Gong’s handwritten font, and the comment is Song Ti. 
0	Also, if breakfast is a little bit later, there is nothing to eat, and the cooking is very average 
1	Fashionable appearance, sapphire blue shell highlights individuality, high performance, low price, three thousand yuan in the killer of books, with the guarantee of the international brand of Hong? XP drive disk 
0	The room is quite poor, but it is also quite cheap. The traffic is not very convenient. It is recommended not to choose.

1	Checked in again a week later. This time I booked a business double room. It seems that the original deluxe double room cannot be booked. The business room has a fax machine, a bathtub in the bathroom and a large window on the wall. But it seems to be small, the price is more than 100 yuan is acceptable, but I still think the deluxe room is practical and the room is more spacious. There was fruit delivery in the room this time, I don't know if it is because of the business room. The hotel is still very comfortable, and the details still need to be improved, such as the large windows on the wall between the bathroom and the room, the glass is very beautiful, but can you consider installing blinds, or it will be inconvenient for visitors to use the bathroom in the room. This time the restaurant did not turn off the lights at 8pm, and it seemed to be still open. I wonder if the comments made last time worked, so I should like it. The hotel used to have an underground parking lot. This time my car was parked underground. Although it is more complicated to go up and down the stairs, there is ample space for parking. The man in charge of the garage is very responsible and feels good. 
1	Perfect screen, very helpful sound quality, I didn't change the system, only made some optimizations and it was very fast. When the genuine P9400 chip becomes cheaper, change one. From the evaluation point of view, the performance of this configuration and the high ratio is actually not much difference in ordinary use, and the cost performance is super. If you change to a higher-end CPU, it will be more than a thousand yuan cheaper than buying it directly. 
1	Hundreds of dollars cheaper than the market price, good quality, complete functions, performance to meet ordinary household and work use, and good heat dissipation. 
0	Jiefang West Street in front of the door is being renovated across the board, and cars can't get in at all without prior notice. The big bed is made up of two single beds, the plastic outer packaging of the mattress is still intact, and the mattress is extremely thin, which can feel the coolness. Too many harassing calls. The checkout speed is too slow. 
1	The swimming pool is under renovation without prior notice, which is very bad, otherwise I won’t book it 
0	The book is very good, but how Dangdang did it, I have always trusted you. Wouldn’t you feel embarrassed to send an old book this time? 
1	First is a perfect screen, satisfied~! All the configurations are enough, don’t play games, just draw CAD and some PHOTOSHOP, then watch movies. Good deal~! Before, everyone said that the heat dissipation is not good, but it is not a big problem. 
1	The old man also knows that you are curious, knows that you have questions, he also allows you to ask questions, and then he will use his profound knowledge to analyze for you patiently, which is reasonable and does not draw conclusions, as if interacting with you. 
1	I have been using linux, I think it is much faster than xp, I like it very much; the keyboard is a little smaller than my previous Samsung, the axis is very strong, the screen feels very comfortable, but I hate the input method 
1	The appearance is really beautiful, the workmanship and feel are also very good! The price is also very high, if you don't use the wireless network card, it will be turned off, so the temperature of the touchpad will be lowered. 
1	The cost performance is very high, all configurations are relatively uniform, and daily office and household needs can basically be met 
0	"The most recent order number is 1442083355. One set of books ""The Wisdom of the Book of Changes"" Dangdang.com has few CDs. In order to get a solution, I wrote twice, and no one responded in two or three days. Then I call [08/1/04 1:30] 010-51236699 customer service hotline, the extension is 3037. Reflect the situation. Dangdang's response was disappointing and asked me to send the book back in full for replacement. Said that no matter where everyone is treated like this. I said it’s so much trouble, can’t you send over the tape you forgot to bring. Dangdang said, no. Such a small matter, such a treatment, personal feeling, shopping on Dangdang, no trouble, as soon as it appears, you are unlucky! I don't plan to ask for the CD, and I won't send the book back, because their attitude makes me worry. I am unlucky. I just consider not buying books online in Dangdang in the future. "
1	Behind the Silver Street of Jinfu, it should be rebuilt from a residential building. I stayed there last month. I originally booked a standard room. When I went there, the standard room did not have a big bed. It was upgraded to a deluxe room. A closer look is a two-bedroom room. The room is quite old, but very clean, there are computers in one room for internet access. The service staff is very kind and very polite. But if you don't ask them for coffee coupons and foot bath coupons, they won't be given. In general, as a business hotel, in addition to the old ones, slower internet speed is acceptable. 
0	One of the damn highlights, there is no operating system or I can't get it, JD's delivery speed! ! ! ! No more 
1	This price, this configuration, should be considered very good. HDMI can be used to play high-definition on the computer and then connected to the TV. 
1	Many years ago, my colleagues read this book to raise their children, and understand some of the views of this book. This time, in order to raise my own children, I bought it and read it carefully. I still feel very rewarding. A successful education case is often more meaningful to parents than some empty educational theories. The educational viewpoints in the book are practical, very specific and valuable for reference. Basically agree with the educational philosophy of the old Karl Witt, except for some individual concepts. Some specific coping styles and educational methods are worth learning for parents. Recommend it! 
1	Yuko's life is like a video tape playing upside down, from blooming flowers to buds, until they turn into seedlings and spread into the earth. Life was reversed in such a peculiar way, she rubbed shoulders with the one she loved. The beginning and end of life may not be what we can predict. No one knows what will happen next. If there is a normal and healthy journey, we should be grateful for the love of life. When you can grasp the love in your hand, take it well and cherish it to your heart's content. Don't hesitate to show it to that person. 
0	"The location is good, very close to the commercial center, political center and the Yellow River. But the service is so poor that even Samsung in the eastern region is not as good. 1. During the day the doorman speaks openly to idlers without greeting guests 2. Stayed in the hotel for 2 days, and none of the service staff took the initiative to say ""hello"" when they met 3. The breakfast is too poor, the variety is small, and the service is poor. If you don't take the initiative, there will be no waiter asking you if you want coffee, and the chef who cooks omelette is mostly missing and has a bad attitude at the time. 4. The hotel hasn't been opened for a long time, but the carpets are very dirty, and there are no cotton swabs. 5. The structure of the hotel is strange, and it feels like it was designed as a government office building. 6. The elevator speed is very slow, there are 3 passenger elevators in total, and the control button is not connected to the Internet. 7. Anyone can use the passenger elevator. I have seen people who deliver couriers and meals. 8. The position of the deputy manager/manager in the lobby is empty. I have only seen a few soldiers sitting there often, which is strange. All in all it was a very unpleasant experience. I stayed at the Feitian Hotel on August 18, and later changed this hotel on the 21st because I thought it was too old. But this hotel is much worse than Feitian Hotel. It was really a wrong decision. (Please refer to my evaluation at Feitian Hotel) Additional comments August 23, 2006: The big bed in the double room is not big at all. The most surprising thing is that after the waiter cleaned up the room in the morning, I went back and took a look. The chair was still mine. When I left, I didn't recover at all, and the plastic bag of disposable slippers I threw on the ground was not taken away. There is no turndown service at all. The bottled water of the water, once the water ran out, I called it 20 minutes later. Too bad, it is recommended not to live. "
0	After I got this book, I couldn't wait to finish reading it in one breath, and it felt quite practical. The self-made soy milk mentioned by the author in the article makes sense to me. I bought a soy milk maker in the store last week and drank a large cup every day. There are still a few secret recipes for dysmenorrhea, I have tried them, and the effect is not bad. Haha, in short, this book is good. 
1	I recently wrote an article about this book and published it in the newspaper. It is estimated that the editor-in-chief published him because he has not read the book. In fact, I want everyone to have a look at this book-----I’m not asking! It's just that the works of modern writers in the 20th century are not widely read. But the works of these writers are very worthy of attention. The printing of this book is very good, and the translation is in place. Each article seems to have a blank space for writing, you can write and draw on the book after reading it. After reading the book, you can write inscriptions on your own book. 
1	The room is very large, and there is a balcony with a sea view. The beach is just outside the hotel, which is very nice. The only regret is that it is not convenient to use UnionPay cards. 
0	The matched driver seems to be used on linux. After looking at it, this is a failure. But if you can find the driver on the official website, it's nothing. Note that the xp and vista versions are different. 
1	"It took a few nights to read all the 100 suggestions in the ""Handbook for Self-Esteem Boys"". I really think it is a very good book. The whole book revolves around how to improve children’s self-esteem and self-confidence. The analysis part is simple and clear, but it is not lost. The suggestion part revolves around the child’s daily study and life, and it sets forth requirements for the words and deeds of parents and teachers according to certain circumstances. Strong pertinence and operability. "
1	Has always been full of attention and admiration for Qu Qiubai. The book was carefully selected, printed very well, and the price is very affordable. If Qu Qiubai does not participate in the Red Revolution, he will have an independent and complete life, and will also have extraordinary accomplishments in other fields. A very intelligent and self-aware person sighs for him. No one can surpass his time, just as he cannot surpass his own skin. Today's comments can only be comments. If we lived in that era, what would our destiny be like? Midu, Midu, where? 
0	This kind of ancient unoccupied hotel is best not to appear on Ctrip! 
0	1. There is only a Dos system, and Xp has been installed for a long time. 2. The color of the exterior part does not match the listed pictures 3. No package 
0	Disadvantages: 1. The USB network cable power interface is on the left, which is very inconvenient. 2. The heat dissipation is a bit large. 3. There are not many expansion interfaces, no volume control buttons, and no hard disk light. 
1	The location is ok, just in the center of the county, it is more convenient to travel. And facing the river down, the scenery is also reasonable. But because it is an old hotel, the equipment is of course very average. And the breakfast is horrible-there are only 8 kinds, not like the breakfast provided by Samsung standards! In addition, you may be asked to check out before 10 o'clock instead of 12 o'clock! 
1	I stayed in a few years ago, this time I feel that it has changed too much, the service is very good, it seems to be fully renovated, the room is very warm, the bedding is very comfortable, and the fruit basket, good night snacks are delivered, and you can also iron for free The clothes are cost-effective, but unfortunately the bathroom is a bit small. In a few days, my colleagues are on a business trip, so I suggest staying here! Additional comments February 25, 2008: The hotel's dining is very good, without advance reservations, so I can only do the lobby, the dishes and taste are superb! 
1	By accidentally seeing this book on the Internet, to purchase to reading. Let me also share this greatest secret, and feel happiness and gratitude from the heart. I am very grateful for the opportunity to read this book, which allowed me to understand a lot of truth and truth. Makes me more awake than before. More energy and confidence. I am more aware of how important reading a good book is to my life (I didn't know about reading before, and I have never tasted the taste and significance of reading a good book), so I sincerely recommend that you read this book carefully. Destiny will definitely change because of our changes. let's work hard together. 
0	I really don’t like the vista system. The switch is slow. There is a click or two when it is turned on. The workmanship is average and there is no texture. The volume is low and the sound quality is poor. 
1	Road repairs near the hotel, travel is more painful. The service is still good as always. Occasionally I went to the gym, I feel so small, the equipment is crowded, and the others are good. BTW: The restaurant has gold and silver cards for discounts. ~ 
1	The configuration is relatively uniform and cost-effective. The configured installation disks are relatively rich. The mouse and screen wipes are very considerate. 
1	Booked a room and stayed for three days, the grade was average, but the price/performance ratio was worth it. 
1	I bought two ASUS notebooks from JD.com. Unexpectedly, Asus's machine is so cost-effective on JD.com. 
1	The location is good, in front of the hotel is the trestle bridge. If you are lucky, you can see the sunrise on the TV tower on the trestle bridge. On the opposite road is the bus stop. You can take special line 311 to Beijiushui (departing from the railway station at 6:45, 7:45, and 8:30 in the morning, it is recommended to wait 10 minutes in advance, and the journey takes 1.5 hours). The service is satisfactory and it feels good to have breakfast while watching the sea view. Since it was built in the 20th century, the decoration is general, but the sanitary equipment is a new Kohler. The soundproofing is really not ideal. The sound of the next door can be heard in the middle of the night. It is recommended to send a card to keep quiet at night when guests check in. There are few places to eat in a better environment, but a 10 yuan taxi ride will definitely find a satisfactory restaurant. The small foods in the hotel corridors are children’s favorites, but everyone consciously uses them in moderation! 
0	I had great expectations for this book at the time...Who knew that the content was completely opposite to the title!!!! Not only is it not funny...The illustrations in it are fake...it seems I reluctantly brought some pictures to PS...Too reluctant to find the ballast...It doesn't work at all!!!! 
1	This book seems to have a very strong lineup. I have reviewed the famous works and recommendations. The overall feeling still lacks some necessary information. For example, for a composer, it is best to list all his works as a catalogue while focusing on his representative works. A popular introductory textbook naturally cannot require the depth of its content, but the book seems to be a bit lacking in breadth, but it is better than many books. In addition, the cd provided is an excerpt from the fragment, which is basically useless. 
0	The design problem, the power supply and hard disk lights are designed to the bottom of the machine, which seems very inconvenient. 
1	It is the most recommended scientific parenting book. This book is concise and powerful, with rich cases. Although they are all cases of foreign children, after reading and practicing, I found that children in the world and parents in the world have many similarities. I will never tire of this book. Every time I encounter difficulties, I can learn from it. I believe that every parent who loves children can benefit from it. I also bought some for my friends who are parents. I think these are the best gifts. Knowledge is power. As mentioned in the book, it is not enough to raise children with love. You have to have knowledge and power so that parents and children can grow together. 
0	Installing the system is a little more difficult for the rookie, mainly because I thought I could go in after I got it. As a result, I couldn't reply by pressing ALT and f10. Later I found a master to install it. As the previous person said, you must first set up, install xp, and then back up, and you can restore it next time. what 
1	"I bought this book after reading everyone's comments. Because my son likes to read books the most, he bought a lot of books at home, especially those with good reviews. I bought 1-30 volumes first, and plan to buy the next 20 volumes. The child is two years old and 3 months old. He likes Brother Xiong and Sister Xiong very much. It also has a good guiding role for children's behavior, ha ha. For example, ""Scientific Diet"". After reading this book, my son became interested in healthy food. I am very happy. My husband and I think the protagonist is not very cute, but my son still likes it, hehe. In short, this is a good book worth buying. "
1	"In busy work, in a sea of lonely people, you may sometimes lose your way. ""Meeting the Unknown Self"" allows you to analyze in the busy, grow in loneliness, and be grateful in understanding. If each of us can develop our own subconscious, many unpleasantness or sadness in life can be easily solved. What everyone pursues in the journey of life should be the happiness after peace, the real happiness. I hope that friends who have not understood their future path can read this book, and explore their subconsciousness with the heroine. I believe there will be some gains. "
0	I think it's very ordinary. I bought it for my nephew, who is 4 and a half years old. I almost never saw him turn it over at home during the vacation. I looked at his other books, and obviously this book is too naive for him. There are many pictures and few words. It seems that there is no pinyin, so I can't remember clearly. 
0	"During May Day, the family chose to go to Fuyang for two days for leisure. Through Ctrip, they booked three standard rooms on May 4th. When checking in, the lady at the front desk told me that I could not come directly through Ctrip next time. I feel that South China is very abiding by the rules of the game. Don't expect that when you get off the car, the doorman will take the initiative to open the door and take the luggage. Even if there is more luggage, you will not wait for the luggage cart. The waiter just looks at it from a distance. The most unacceptable thing is that The so-called five-star hotel does not have air conditioning, and the night is extremely stuffy. When I asked the front desk, the answer I got turned out to be ""maybe because you are too afraid of heat"". Therefore, it is strongly requested that Ctrip put parentheses after the asterisk when recommending online (The air conditioner is not turned on all the year round, and the service consciousness is extremely poor) "
0	1. The operating system is indeed a big problem. Although there is no problem with reinstalling XP, it is a waste of time; 2. The heat dissipation problem is the worst of my hand-held devices, and the wrist is scary; 3. Keyboard There is indeed a problem, you must press the middle button accurately, otherwise there will be no response; 
1	This time there is no executive room, I want to see the difference between the ordinary big bed and the executive room. Found the room was good. The bed is big. The service attitude is not bad, there is a girl doorman at the door with a good smile. The reception and concierge services are also good. 
1	This book, I didn't cry when I was reading it, and it didn't have the sorrow I expected, but it was already an absolute leader among similar books. The author’s writing gave me a kind of feeling that this thing happened in real time, and it must be the thoughts and behaviors that he has experienced personally. I think that I only have feelings when I am on the scene. However, I read the postscript and found this The whole story was just formed in the author's mind and suddenly felt that the author was powerful~ We followed the heroine and experienced a series of events, and grew up with her, whether it was our mind or love friendship. 
0	I don’t know if it’s a problem, but when I close the notebook, the gap is a bit big. But it has no effect. 
1	I think this is a very good book. First, it is a fictional love story based on historical events. I find it very touching. After reading this book, I realized the missing knowledge about the history of Shanghai. If you want to study history, but feel that pure history books are boring, then I recommend this book. You can also look at history while you read the story. The article narrated a very poignant love story. Although a little weird, a little weird. But it is also the love that people most want to have and see in their hearts. This is a book worth buying. 
0	Hotel facilities and environment are very poor, very uncomfortable, very dissatisfied! 
0	The service attitude is quite poor. Most of the services in Shanghai hotels I have come across are like this. Maybe this is a regional culture (I don’t know if this sentence is considered an uncivilized term). Hotel feedback July 22, 2008: Dear guest, hello ! We apologize for the discomfort you encountered in the hotel, we sincerely hope that every customer can spend a good time in our hotel, if you encounter difficulties in the hotel, please contact the hotel lobby manager as soon as possible , We will solve your problems in time, give you a satisfactory reply, and look forward to your visit again! 
1	The comprehensive price/performance ratio definitely exceeds Shenzhou's big-name guarantee. The best thing is that there is still a year of accidental all-inclusive package. When people use it, it is super assured. It is too far worse than the home machine I have used in terms of serious stability and details. Black never fades Good looking and beautiful 
1	I haven't lived in Tibet Mansion for a long time. I used to go to Beijing to live here. This time I moved in and found that I changed the LCD TV, but the network was not very good. They themselves said it was caused by charges. Others are good. 
0	The heat dissipation is a bit too big, it will be hot after booting, the driver is not very easy, but it is basically done, the camera is not very good 
0	This version of Baihua Publishing House is not like a genuine novel, and there are a lot of typos and typos. It doesn't make sense to look at it, which is really depressing! I don’t know which original novel is, where can I buy it 
0	The screen has no dead or dark spots, which is pretty good. The configuration is cost-effective. It has been used for half a month and is basically normal. 
0	Because I wanted to inspect the goods, I found that it was messy and could not be inspected at all. Fortunately, I trust JD. There is no problem when I get it back. I will choose express delivery next time. In addition, there will be current sounds when I pick up the microphone, which is a bit scary. 
0	"I have stayed in so many hotels, and I have never lived in such a small, dirty and smelly ""big bed room""! As soon as I entered the door, I was smoked out by a odor, and the windows were not reduced much after a day’s opening. The bathroom is small and dirty, disgusting! Since my husband and I entered the door, we could only be on the bed and the other could stand on the ground! The only advantage: the location is good, the commercial street downstairs is very lively, and there are snacks at night, just downstairs, not far from Daxiangguo Temple and Shanshangan Guild Hall, you can walk. However, the expectations for snacks must not be too high, so as not to feel deceived. Regardless of the price, there is really no way to see hygiene. "
1	The room is oversized, not so big. Hahahahahahahahahaha. Additional comments August 11, 2008: There are few places to eat around. 
0	Bored, moaning without illness, according to her, a woman had better find a rich man to marry as soon as possible, and she had to faint when she was in her twenties and think that she was a noble, and others would treat you as a noble. , The stick is obscene! 
0	I bought this book after listening to the boss’s introduction. I thought it contained some short stories or short poems suitable for children to read. I didn’t expect it to be pure theory. As an educator, I certainly know that reading aloud to a child before enlightenment is of great benefit, so no matter how good the book is, I think it is of no use to me. I left it there after turning a few pages. 
1	My family and I started staying at Tianfu Sunshine Hotel on May 7. Although there was a little misunderstanding, it was quickly resolved through Ctrip's communication. I am very satisfied with the hotel's positive attitude and the subsequent meticulous service. It is worth mentioning that the hotel’s emergency measures and responsibility to the guests on the day of the earthquake on May 12 felt the warmth of the hotel. Have the opportunity to stay at this hotel again, and recommend all friends to stay at this hotel! 
0	It would be better if you bring Bluetooth! The LCD does not have the width difference of more than ten MM, and the length is almost the same. It would be great if the price could be more favorable! 
1	The big screen does feel good. It feels good to watch movies and play games. The heat dissipation is also good, and it is not very hot after driving all day. The cooling sound is not loud. When I went to Dinghao, Zhongguancun, Hailong waited to see, the price here is a bit cheaper than them. 
0	I regret it when I read it. I don't have anything except stringing the words together. It's better to list those words one by one. Want to increase vocabulary? It is really impossible to rely on him, at least it is me. After reading an article, there is no urge to read it. In order not to waste money, it was used as a small vocabulary list, and looked up in the catalog when necessary. There is still no shortcut to learning English, especially remembering words~~&#183;~&#183; 
0	"The book that I ordered on November 21st, and 9 books together with this one, have not been received in 11 days until today! During the call to the customer service to ask, it is disgusting that the customer service rolls his tongue and thinks it sounds good. ""Then I can't help it."" He didn't say to check with me. This service will kill you sooner or later! Dangdang: Your customers will decrease! You wait and see! You go on to fool you! "
1	【Recommendation】Love is a memory after everything is gained and then everything is lost. A poignant love story, when the text is crying, perhaps we know what is poignant and what is sadness. From the initial love of revenge to the final parting of life and death, only the person concerned can understand the reluctance and deep love. It is precisely because of the last deep love that it creates regrets that are like a dream even if the good times are good? A love novel with regret 
1	The room is too old and the service is ok, after all, the hotel industry in Changchun is not very advanced 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, the room is very comfortable, will stay next time. 
0	But the notebook did not send the bag and the inner liner, it was very troublesome~~~~ In addition, I still feel that the notebook is a bit heavy. 
1	Not much heat, the keyboard feels good, the customer service of the notebook is very professional, the appearance is very beautiful, at least about 300-600 yuan lower than the market price 
0	My order on January 16th, EMS cost 20 yuan per person, and it did not arrive until February 2nd. When it arrives, it is not in fucking Mandarin, it is in fucking Cantonese. Dangdang is a fucking liar. 
0	I haven't read the Japanese version, but after reading it, it feels suitable. The content is very light and has no deep meaning. The drawing is not very good either. 
1	Everyone will have all kinds of first time, first time to go to school, first time in love, first time to live alone without family This book allows people who already live alone to see their own shadows, people who plan to live alone as a reference, and people who yearn to live alone can imagine. The author uses simple words and friendly images to tell us one story after another in life. You will feel warm and happy. When you finish reading this book, you may have a slight smile at the corner of your mouth! 
0	Hotel service is relatively poor, except for the attitude of the front desk. The service quality and attitude of the guest rooms and restaurants are relatively poor, and they cannot be counted as 3-star hotels at all. In addition, the room is relatively clean. The most depressing thing is that I didn't have breakfast~~ After watching the sunrise in the morning, I went back to the hotel and went to the restaurant for breakfast and was told that it had all been ordered. The waiter also asked us why we did not make a reservation, and no one reminded us when we checked in. In addition, I have observed that most of the guests who have already booked for breakfast are not hotel guests. A team led by a tour guide came in to eat from the outside. What are the interests of the residents~~. 
0	The Ming Dynasty history was written in a ridiculous and popular way, which not only popularized the history, but also allowed readers to enjoy the pleasure of reading. Thank you Mingyue that year, so talented! 
0	The cheap one seems to be Building No. 1, which is too bad, air-conditioning, no heating, no broadband, so don’t live. Can recommend a hotel opened by the Transportation Bureau opposite the bus station, with broadband. Also convenient. Longyan is like a county-level city and it is not easy to take taxis. Hotel feedback March 12, 2008: Central air-conditioning, heating, and free broadband Internet access in Building 1. The hotel provides free valet contact taxi service. 
1	I bought this X200 for my wife, small and exquisite, suitable for women to carry, it is very cool to use, and the price is very reasonable 
0	The disadvantage of computer hardware is that the graphics card is a bit difficult to run large games, and there are often texture errors when playing some very simple 3D games. This is also the case when changing the driver. So I can only say that the HD3650 has defects in the design. Secondly, the goods sent by Jingdong are also of quality. There is a clear sense of collapse in the upper left corner of the problem keyboard 
1	This time I booked 2 deluxe single rooms by phone during the 51 period. Upon seeing it, the deluxe single rooms are like suites, with one bedroom and one living room. They are located on the 22nd floor with a wide view. There are many travel books introducing Luoyang in the living room. The location of the hotel is also possible, only 12 kilometers away from Longmen Grottoes and 1 kilometers away from the city center. The downside is that the hotel facilities are slightly older. 
0	I stayed at Xingya Jianguo Hotel on February 17, 2008. I didn't even have the four-star standard. There were many obvious cracks on the wall, the bathroom facilities were rusty, and the front desk service was average. The waiter also said that 480 yuan was the price during the special period. Ctrip There is fruit on the order, but I have never seen it. The 5-star hotels in Zhengzhou should be re-rated 
0	I don't know why such a high evaluation came from, is it Dangdang's ranking? The good books I scoured have never been in the rankings, only this one was affected by the rankings, which is not interesting at all. 
1	Stayed once and it was OK. But Ctrip’s rooms are always bad 
1	The hotel facilities are relatively 4 stars and are slightly outdated, and the additional charges for the Internet are unreasonable, but the waiter is the most enthusiastic I have ever seen, not only ran to the third floor (I took the elevator, but the elevator door was broken, she went out and fiddled with the door (Closed) Open the door for me, enter the door to help me turn on the hot water, and help me fill the kettle with water. It is so enthusiastic...Breakfast is not a self-service, 10 yuan breakfast has nothing to eat, it can only be filled Stomach, cost-effective! 
1	The hotel is at the entrance of the development zone, which happens to be a business trip in the development zone. So it feels very convenient. The heating in the room is fully turned on, so the temperature of -15 degrees does not feel cold. The quality of the rooms is not bad, and it is very satisfying to have such a hotel in the development zone. The quality of breakfast needs to be improved. Cheap is cheap, but there is really nothing to eat. 
1	I was very excited to receive the book, and I could not wait to open the package and start reading with my dreams and expectations. I think every part of the book is good, but the lack of engines and avionics systems is a fly in the ointment. In addition, there are too few existing industrial examples, and many new structures are not shown or prompted. Perhaps our technology has been blocked for too long. However, the Black Hawk helicopter is also a very classic model. If this aircraft can be dissected properly, it will be of considerable help to our development of civilian helicopters. 
1	"Although there are many problems mentioned by people, these problems do exist, but they really lead me to the door of Chinese massage. I can't bear to take my children to the hospital for injections and suffer the most, so I decided to learn massage techniques so that both adults and children can suffer less. Now I give my child a massage after taking a shower every day. Once I just started to have a runny nose and cough, I hurried to massage according to a few acupoints in the book. I pressed it for more than half an hour while the child was sleeping. I was really fine the next day! If you think there is a problem with the details in the book, please read Doctor Zhou's book again. ""Matchstick Doctor's Notes"" and so on. "
0	"Bi Shumin, a well-known writer and psychologist, has read one or two essays before and thinks that this author is very delicate and his psychological description is very suitable for the sensitive me. After weighing it up, I felt that I was not addicted to buying the novel ""Female Psychologist""! The brief introduction has exhausted the main line of the story. It is a good subject matter, but the cumbersome content is not expected to destroy the book. It should be said that not every book will have a profound impact on everyone, and there are few books that have a profound impact on our lives, and the process of searching for this basic book will undoubtedly test your money for a person who loves to collect books. The helplessness of the bag. Well-known authors have one or two or more famous works, but apart from the books that make Zhi famous, the rest are not necessarily classics, because there is no law that celebrities must publish books. "
1	The room is good, I will continue to stay next time I have the opportunity. The price can be even cheaper. 
1	Sorry, I uploaded the wrong review of another book just now because I bought dozens of books and got confused. My child and I like this series of three books very much, and we often discuss the content together. I plan to take him to make some insect specimens during the summer vacation! 
1	"Today I was making noodles at home, and my daughter asked me: ""Mom, are you making solid or liquid noodles?"" I was stunned, ""It's really hard to tell."" I answered. The daughter said: ""Mixed solid and liquid!"" Yes, it's right. It was explained in the book ""Mixed State of Matter"". Then, my daughter tried me again, whether the person was a liquid or a solid and so on. I sigh, book, just useful! value! "
0	Not as good as it was when it opened. The carpet in the room is dirty, the internet speed is very slow, and the operation of the TV is very inhumane. The floor drain of the shower is very slow, and if you are not careful, it will flood the Jinshan! The price of massage and foot therapy in the hotel is to let you go once and never go again, and it will always encourage you to increase consumption items! ! There are also advantages, that is, the girl at the front desk check-in is indeed very beautiful, ha ha. 
1	I read the comments before saying that the book box I received was broken, and I was a little worried, ha ha! But the box sent was really good, as good as the box from Jin Yong's collection before. For me, the size of the book is also moderate, because I just like the small version of the book, and I also received a set of pocket books of Tang code world famous books. Speaking of Doraemon, the printing is also very good. The cover of each book is the same as the old version before. Some people say that each book has one or two changes. I am ashamed. I didn't see it, maybe I didn't read it all Live it! For me I like it very much! 
1	Finally, I can rate it. Give it a five-star rating. I really like this book. About Peng Lao, I think I can’t praise it too much. There are three reasons: 1. The language is easy to understand, easy to understand, and easy to read and understand. 2. The theory is in-depth and thorough, pointing directly to the essence of Chinese medicine. 3. Complete content system and clear levels 
1	As the title says, a book suitable for quiet reading, a book that requires patience and taste, the age of poetry seems to be far away from us, but when I turn over the yellowed pages, I recall the poems that I have shook my head and remembered. I couldn't help but feel warm. How long have we been so quiet? Looking for peace in the bustling city, finding a moment of peace in the hustle and bustle of life, shuttled to different banquets, entertainment, KTV every day, are you tired of you? Are you really happy? Settle a home for your soul and hope that all people will get the most beautiful ordinary. 
0	"It's a family hotel.. It also has a 298+12 fund... When I went there happened to be National Day. They said that they were renovating and arranged me in the same place as the front house.. At the beginning, they took me to Building 6, Damn it. It’s not that people live in.. Then take me back to Building 8. It’s bigger.. And this place is far from the sea. In the evening, we will be transported to the beach by car on the next day. It rained heavily on the second day and said that the car was not there. My friend negotiated with him, and my travel mood was affected... I was fooled by the photos of ctrip.. This broken hotel is really not for people to live in!! I won't be looking for cheap anymore!! Additional comment October 2007 11th: Room 298 marked ""Broadband Free"" on the ctrip.. But there is no Internet access at all.. The heavy computer I brought was just for nothing.. I feel cheated!! "
0	The screen looks uncomfortable, Vista is very slow, especially shutting down. The partition is unreasonable. There are three areas: one 1G (I don’t know what to do), one 10G (used for backup, after other software is installed, it is found that the 10G space is not enough, the backup can’t be done), the other is the C drive, and vista’s own partition cannot use. 
1	Compared with the original 1000h upgrade, the keyboard is much better than the previous anti-dust and debris; and the price is still with genuine xp, which is very good value! 
1	"I really like ""Harry Potter""! I finally look forward to the finale, a perfect ending! The final ending of the story proves that Harry Potter is a fairy tale. Although, after several years of waiting, the fans have grown up from children. The story also went from being thrilling to getting darker and darker, saying that he is a fairy tale, but not suitable for children to read. Fortunately, the final ending is back to the fairy tale routine. The protagonist will live a happy life! "
1	The location in the center of Shanghai makes it more bullish. However, the price/performance ratio is high in the surrounding hotels, and it is difficult to book a double room. 
1	It doesn’t look good to look at the picture, but the real thing is pretty, a bit like a business machine, it feels good, the configuration is also balanced, and the home is completely OK. 
1	"Eh. . . . . . . . . Sorry, I wrote the wrong book. . . . It was written for ""Millionaire"", and the cover looks a bit like. . . "
1	This hotel is relatively old, and the special rooms are also very average. Generally speaking 
0	The mold of the notebook shell is a bit rough, the USB port feels rough, and the metal of the interface is seen. accurate. 
1	: The price is good, the workmanship is exquisite, the appearance is acceptable, and it is very suitable for engineering students. The configuration and price are really suitable and fully enough, and the quality of Xiaohei is very good. It looks good, I prefer the black notebooks, so I am very satisfied with them! In addition, the overall feel of the books is very strong! 
0	1. The battery is not strong 2. There is no pre-installed software; at least one needs to be obtained for power management, HP? 
1	The heat dissipation effect is good, the power consumption is very low, the configuration is high, the sound is very small during operation, and the screen is quite comfortable. 
1	The quality of hotel facilities and services is average, and the traffic conditions are relatively convenient, which is more suitable for middle-income families. 
0	The picture is messy, I am used to a more delicate style of painting, and the content of the story is also very boring. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, especially the screen. The screen is perfect after inspection. The other configuration is also consistent with the product introduction. The machine received is an unopened machine. The hard disk is powered on for 8 hours. I am very satisfied. 
1	There is no doubt that all the books of Mr. Lin Yutang are good books in my opinion, and they are all worth reading. This book was written by Mr. Lin in English and translated by a certain Huang surnamed (forgive me for my ignorance). It feels helplessly translated into Chinese as if it is more difficult to understand than the original English. The wording and grammar of some sentences are really obscure and a little uncomfortable. I think, even Mr. Lin's Chinese prose masterpieces are not so sloppy. It is indeed the style of writing in the 1930s, but it is a bit overdone and too artificial. But even so, I recommend everyone to read it. After all, it is Mr. Lin's famous work. 
0	Although the price of the hotel has risen a lot recently, but because it is close to the TV station, I have stayed many times. And the recent practice of the hotel is very infuriating. On July 25th, I went to Shanghai at 3 o’clock in the afternoon. I didn’t notice the time when I was resting in my room at noon. When I went downstairs to check out, it was 1 o’clock. It is settled in 1.5 days. No matter how it is explained, it will not help. What was even more annoying was that the restaurant called me a taxi to the airport after the checkout, and the driver didn't make a meter and asked for 120 yuan to go. Obviously, no more than 80 yuan to the airport. Such hotel service is not as good as 2 stars! ! ! ! ! 
0	I didn't like prose at first. I read it because of Zhang Ailing. Half of the time I read it, I felt bored. Maybe it was because he lost Zhang Ailing and didn't like the author even more. I didn't plan to finish it. 
0	1. There is almost no hot water. 2. There are a lot of residues in the hotel kettle. 3. The room has a strong smell of formaldehyde. The hotel booked me 5001. At night, when the room goes out, turn right to the beauty salon (everyone knows what it is Shop) The voice of the lady there is louder than that of the TV, and the karaoke outside the window of the room sings until 2 in the morning and dances. What irritates me most is that there is a pair of men’s underwear between the two bath towels in the bathroom. It seems that they have been used. When complaining to the hotel reception, the hotel manager with glasses always asks me to ask. , What can I ask, do you want a full waiver? This hotel really chills me! Never seen a hotel like this! ! ! Additional comments July 2, 2008: It is strongly recommended not to stay at Huairen Hotel 
0	I have stayed in this hotel before and thought it was okay, but this time I felt very bad. The room that was arranged to stay in turned out to be a room without windows. Since it was late at that time and the only room, I had to live in it, but I remembered it now I have lingering fears. If there happened to be a fire that day, what should I do? In fact, I always have a question, why the room booked through Ctrip is not on the side or at which corner? There are still no windows! Price problem? Hotel feedback, 2008 4 22nd: First of all, thank you very much for your evaluation of the hotel. We apologize for your discomfort in the hotel! Ctrip has always been an important partner of the hotel. We have always tried our best to provide the best quality service to Ctrip’s customers. However, due to the architectural pattern of the hotel, there are three rooms without panes. The guest booked late that day and the hotel rooms were tight. No window room arrangement. However, the front desk will communicate with guests before arranging guests to stay in this type of room. Regarding the safety issues raised by the guests, the room has the same facilities and equipment except for no windows, and the hotel has a complete fire protection system. Every year, it passes the relevant audits of the fire department to ensure the safety of customers. Thank you again for your comments and look forward to your visit again! 
0	In a typical state-owned hotel, the management lacks responsibility and management is chaotic. The headlights, mirrors, lamps and desk lamps in the room are all broken, and there is only one bedside lamp available. I don't know how the hotel maintains it. The most annoying thing is that it is a blackmail to ask the guest to pay for the shoebox in the room that has been damaged for a long time. 
1	This book uses conspiracy theories to explain the cause and effect of all major historical events in modern times. Unveiling the power of this new weapon of finance. When I saw the introduction of Guoshu in a novel, I felt very incredible. After buying this book, I spent a week reading it and I feel that I have benefited a lot. I have a general understanding of the destructive effects of currency, combined with the ups and downs of China's stock market and property market, I am very impressed. They are also full of concerns about China's financial security under the new situation. Friends of independent financial management should read this book. If financial danger comes, everyone will be closer to the security gate. 
1	The old store is more trustworthy, you can consider it next time you stay. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Dear guests: Hello everyone! Thank you for choosing to stay at the Ramada Hotel Xinjiang Tunhe and your evaluation of this hotel. We apologize for your unsatisfactory staying at this hotel in the early period! This hotel underwent a brand new renovation in May 2008, including The decoration of the room, the equipment of facilities, and the attitude towards customers, we hope that through our apologies and improvements in work, we can get your understanding, and welcome you to come back again in the future. We will do our best to build each One detail makes your stay satisfied. 
1	It is very convenient because it is very close to the customer. To be honest, the room has not paid much attention, because only the morning is more awake during the day, and the rest is drunk. The breakfast was good and the room was clean. It's a pity that I stayed for two and a half days in a hurry and didn't go to see the largest surf swimming pool in the city. 
1	The location is very good, very close to the foreign goods market. The decoration of the room is ok, but a bit small. The TV is LCD, and it feels good overall. 
0	"I have stayed in more than 10 hotels in Beijing, and I also like to live in apartments, from Kempinski to Jianguo Hotel, from Jingguang to Meihua to Star City Liangma, and this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Apartment. No wonder the price can’t go up, not because there’s something to do. I hope there are so many good reviews here that are not gunners. 1. The entrance is hard to find, let’s not say. Having said that, I firmly disagree to take my ID to copy. Private accommodation is mixed with tourists. It's strange to see people returning from grocery shopping with the elevator dragging their boxes. 2. I received a harassing call in the middle of the night. 3. The design and decoration of the room was very ""homely"", and the facilities were outdated, very similar to the farm house rented in Jiangnan Ancient Town. 3. The room I lived in happened to be at the entrance of the aisle, and the sound was a big one, who Said the room is soundproof? The movement of the residents upstairs is clear. 4. The service attitude is not good, and the guests speak in the same tone as the guests. 5. If you really want to find an advantage: the only thing is that the community is relatively quiet and there is no car noise. "
0	Can this book be recommended? The focus is almost always on establishing a good image for oneself by saying good things and self-defense about a certain lawsuit. It is good to have money, and you can publish a book like this 
0	The room is very average, small and dirty, with poor sound insulation, people in the corridor can be heard speaking, the corridor is dimly lit and there is nothing to eat next to it 
0	The only downside is that the original package is missing from the delivery. How can I carry it? And no one has been actively contacting me when to send it again, as if there is no such thing, it is regrettable! 
0	Recently it has become a four-star, it seems that the room has been renovated. The restaurant has also been renovated. The breakfast was good. Hehe, keep working hard 
1	[Recommendation book] Because crackling is great, I have bought a lot of books as a gift 
0	Piano lacquer mirrors cannot prevent fingerprints, which is a pity! I was the first one to comment on this product. In the case of the same city, JD Express made me wait for 3~4 days. What a pity! It took another whole day for the order confirmation to end, which is a pity! 
0	It didn't feel like that when I lived in, it was old and not very clean. The beach next to it was dirty, and there was a big ditch that poured dirty water into the sea. I really wanted to escape. 
0	The attitude of the hotel’s front desk is extremely bad. I booked a double room on the evening of December 14th. Ctrip’s reservation is until 9pm. Due to changes in the itinerary, the arrival time will be postponed because the hotel has a provincial conference that day. The room may be tight, so call the front desk of the hotel before 8 o’clock that night and tell me that I will be late. Please keep the room. The answer from the front desk is yes. I arrived at the hotel at 9:30 that night and the front desk told me that I had booked 9 At o'clock, the room was cancelled and there was no room. I also showed me the Ctrip reservation fax. I said that I had called in advance to inform me that I would be late and I had received your promise. Now the cancellation of the room is considered my responsibility. , After a long quarrel, a lobby manager came and came up with the same nonsense. In the end, he said that I could only give me an extra bed in a big bed room. This hotel is also disappointed to sign an agreement! 
1	Thin and light, the overall feeling is particularly smooth, and it feels very suitable for boys. It has edges and corners and looks very tough. It has many characteristic designs that make people love it. Especially at this price point, it is very cost-effective. 
1	To be honest, I didn't know that there was such a holy book in education before. My brother told me that it was a very suitable book for me. He should read it carefully, and it would be helpful to how to educate children in the future. What the younger brother said was right, I believed him, so I bought it the next day, and the book arrived after four days. After I got the book, I read a few pages carefully. The methods and methods of educating children in the book are worth learning. Genius is not born, but genius can be cultivated. I believe this sentence, I believe this book can bring me immense help. 
0	Feeling fooled. . . . I heard it's hot on TV. , I don’t know anything in the book, but the story is taken from the reader. . . Boring. 
0	The keyboard R key is not in good contact, so you must press it hard. I hope it will improve if you use it more. The headphone jack is very loose when it comes in, and tight when it is about to end, slightly flawed, but acceptable. 
1	The advantages are well-known, many friends around are using them, otherwise they would not buy them. But I didn't want to say, the reason is below. 
0	If you are used to a five-star hotel, it is best not to live in this hotel. The price is five stars and the value is at most four stars. It's too much! We live in a super deluxe room. The bed cabinets are like guest houses. The TV is an old model with a big butt of 23 inches. What's more, the waiter will knock on the door symbolically and come in directly. I'm quite dissatisfied with seeing people who come in without waiting for us to open the door and open it by ourselves! (But there seems to be no better hotel in Shantou, haha) 
0	"I bought ""Seeking a doctor is worse than asking myself"" and ""Zhou Ruchang's Proofreading Stone"" and found that the paper quality of the books is quite different from what is sold in the bookstore. "
0	The content is simple and the author is always eloquently defending himself. It is purely a book of hype and packaging. It talks about the experiences of Sun Yingui and his brothers and defends himself. 
0	Because I followed my mother to read these health care books, there are also several books in the series about seeking medical advice, but the evaluation of this book can only be said to be average. But reading will always find something useful, and there are a few methods in the book that are still practical. 
0	The book should be righteous for people, so I don't think this book is of much help. The name of the book is quite tempting. But after reading it, I feel that the content written in it is also very general. It's nothing. When I bought this book, I heard my friends say it before I bought it. After reading it, I felt regret. . . 
1	"This is a book worth reading. It seems that the Hope Project is not only in China, but also in foreign countries. In the past, philanthropy was always regarded as a matter for the rich. The ancients said that if you are poor, you will be alone, and if you are rich, you will benefit the world. But the foreigner in the book is not wealthy. It is really admirable to be able to achieve this level. The rich man who helped him set up the foundation is also very character, and he can say something like this to his friends: ""It's been fifty years, I built a school in the Himalayas. What did you do?"" Everyone has a look. In addition to being moved, this book also contains deep thoughts. How about our charity? "
0	I checked in on November 29th and left the store on December 1st. Since I accidentally forgot my newly bought leather shoes and accessories on an instrument at the hotel, I called them. I am very patient, and I would like to express my thanks! But I don’t know why, the person at the front desk just couldn’t find it. I called the guest room in person after asking for the phone number from the room service center. But the leather shoes and the accessories are separated. I said, then send the accessories back to me. I found the SF Express company to adopt the collect method, but the leather shoes were really not sent back to me. I put these two things in Why are the shoe boxes separated? The impression is that the front desk is good, but the guest room does not work well. 
0	It is too much trouble to install the system. It would be nice if the merchant could provide detailed steps to replace the XP system when purchasing the computer. 
1	The decoration is old, especially the color of the carpet material is dirty, which is not commensurate with the four-star rating, the doorman is very enthusiastic, like one 
1	"By the way... the ""atypical exhibits"" I said are called ""trace exhibits"" in the book, and they probably mean the same thing~~ Hehehe I add that although I have watched the movie N times, I don’t feel repetitive after reading the original work again , It’s a bit of fun to associate the movie scene, the ending is still very much looking forward to~ I may come up YY~~ "
1	Haha, after all, it is the best hotel in the local area, so, in addition to facilities 
0	A super vulgar book, it feels like the thoughts of the aunts who buy vegetables and set up street stalls. Is this the Korean woman? 
1	What an incredible book this is, what an incredible discovery, it gave me a great shock. I saw it from a friend at first. The author didn’t tell me anything in the book, but just put out the photos to let the readers appreciate it. But just like the title of the book, water tells us the answer. Even the water that we seem to be lifeless is so magical. Knowing all the good and the ugly, pretentious human beings have any reason to do things that hurt others or nature. Strongly recommend, you can read it regardless of age 
1	The order price was 4599 yuan, and 150 yuan Dongjuan was used. Plus the gift package. When I received the goods, it went up by 200 yuan. Good value for money. 
0	The product information has not been professional enough. Before I ordered it, I thought that the computer did not have Bluetooth, and I ordered a USB Bluetooth module. Fortunately, I didn't want it for the time being. I cancelled it, otherwise I would buy more. 
0	"My son is one and a half years old, and I bought him a crackle book before. It is very good and my son likes it. I also benefit from the loyal users of Dangdang.com. When I saw this set of books this time, everyone said it was good and bought it for my son, but my son didn't like it and said ""not good-looking"". There are several reasons: 1. The screen is simple, and some are basically a line of text on a blank page. 2. The painting is also general 3. The storyline is relatively simple. 4. The paper is thinner. 5. Personally think that this set of books is more suitable for children 1 year old or younger. Of course, there are many advantages. Each of the 12 books has a story, and daily life stories, which can help babies develop good habits. And these shortcomings are advantages for little babies. After I got the book, I regretted buying it for my son and wanted to transfer it. "
0	The product has been received! I simply turned it over and only read the first few books. I feel that the words are too few and there is no plot. I don’t know how the next few books are. In short, I don’t feel too ideal. My child is one year old and seven months old. Not as good as baby pictorial 
0	This book vividly reflects the various rules of the workplace in the way of writing a character. No wonder he is one of the most popular books right now. It's worth seeing. 
1	The biggest feature is of course its compactness. Needless to say, Samsung's workmanship. The keyboard feels very good, the loudspeaker volume is not very large, the treble is a bit small and the bass is insufficient, if the environment is not too noisy, it can cope with normal use. It's very quiet and powerful under startup conditions. 
0	This version of Baihua Publishing House is not like a genuine novel, and there are a lot of typos and typos. It doesn't make sense to look at it, which is really depressing! I don’t know which original novel is, where can I buy it 
1	By the way, the printing is good, and I also recommend it to friends and colleagues, not bad. 
0	Economy hotel, so the price is moderate. Hotel facilities and services are average. Although it is in Yalong Bay, the traffic is very inconvenient, so I might as well live in the city next time. 
0	It is better to seek medical treatment than to seek self. 1—3 are all good books, such as persisting in reading and persisting in doing. I think the effect must be very good. I suggest that everyone can buy it through Dangdang. Other ways are more expensive. 
0	Although the reservation is more convenient, the hotel's care for customers is insufficient, and the room is so cold that people can't sleep. The service staff also said that it is warm! ! ! Hotel feedback May 4, 2008: First of all, thank you for staying at Huibin Building and asking us questions. Due to the high altitude of Mount Wutai, the climate is humid and the temperature difference is large, the hotel is closed in winter, the temperature of the room may be a little cool at night after opening The hotel apologizes for the inconvenience caused. 
1	The machine is good. . . It’s better than expected. I thought I didn’t have a mouse, but I didn’t expect to bring one. Very good and powerful 
0	Without XP or Vista installed, it is easy for consumers to install the wrong order when installing by themselves, causing the sound card and graphics card to not work normally. The official driver is more fancy 
0	1. The screen is too wide. I chose 14 for family use at the time, but I didn't expect that 16:9 would be so wide, the height and width were seriously out of adjustment, and the brightness was okay; 2. The optical drive was not well crafted, loose, and the CD was not pressed tightly. Not out 
0	I have seen overwhelming compliments before, so I bought it dubiously. I opened it and saw that the market liked it from the introduction. There are also lesbians. The little character description is very close to our usual work and life. , Some chapters in the book are not only meaningful for reference, but also meaningful for learning! 
1	Because I have to drive home, I have to buy a map of the whole country. Online comparison, after field investigation, locked this book, but hesitated between small book and big book. Driving, the road is far and running, the kid must not be able to see clearly, and finally chose the big one. Sure enough, the big book looks very comfortable. Although it occupies a space, the effect is very good and it is worth it~ In addition, although this map is not the latest version, it is enough, and the high-speed points of the route are not bad. And the surrounding road conditions are quite detailed. Self-driving friends are worth having! 
0	I really like Jack Ma on impulse and bought this book. After flipping through it, I found that it was really impulsive. It is an excerpt from the on-site reviews. Personal advice. 
1	I gave one to my aunt. She looked very good and inspired. It seems that I have one more thing for elders, so I bought four more books to give to other elders. Friends are also very good, it just happens to be popular now how to maintain health. 
0	Dear members: Happy Chinese New Year and safe seasons! Greetings! I am a Hongkonger living in a small place, but I have never seen such a small standard room in a hotel in the mainland. Honestly speaking, this hotel room is so small! Obese brothers and sisters have difficulty walking around! As the previous member said! The seat of the bathroom floor and water closet has hair and cannot stand upright! The hotel and room color is OK! Inconvenient location far away from the stations! The environment is not very good, the houses are too close to the windows! The price of RMB300 is not worth it! I do not recommend! ! ! 
0	The system is not easy to set up. The original VISTA took two days to change to XP. A friend who worked at Lenovo filled an SL400 XP, but the released XP only had a C drive, and it took a week to get it right. 
1	Good quality, good heat dissipation, 3-4 hours, warm. The vista system does not need to be reinstalled. Refer to the question and answer in Lenovo. It can block many functions and increase the speed. The final effect is about the same as the XP boot speed. 2g standard +1g free memory is enough. Note that when you turn off the startup item, do not turn off the function that detects vibration, which is to protect the hard disk. Do not install coffee for sale, do not install trial version of office. The hard disk is divided by third-party software, otherwise only 89g can be released. The original mouse is quite good, but a bit smaller. 
0	The buffet in the morning was very bad, it was too dirty to eat, and it was 20 per person. The waiters in the Chinese restaurant were very bad, and if they wanted to eat, they would die first. Never go again.

1	Appearance: Metal frame with white body is very delicate and small. Volume: It is indeed a lot lighter and very convenient to take out. Keyboard: It feels good and the size is right. The attached liner bag is pretty good and feels good. 
0	I wanted to read this book with great joy, but I couldn't think of a guy in Dangdang who actually gave me two books that were completely unmatched! ! After buying things for so long in Dangdang, this is the first time I have encountered this. I'm furious! ! 
0	The binding of the book is very bad. The pages start to fall as soon as you open it. From a literary point of view, Hu is very literary, starting from emotions 
0	The ordinary standard room is too old to live in. Ctrip shouldn't sign such a bad room. After changing to a deluxe standard room, it was okay. The change was a bit late, it was a windowless room. depressed. It's unreasonable for a two-year-old kid to ask for money for breakfast. 
0	The problem of high heat generation has not been solved. This is an old problem for Lenovo. The THINKPAD series does not have this problem. Domestic brands still have to do better in details to be competitive. 
0	The surrounding area of the hotel is quite prosperous, with Pizza Hut on the opposite side. The service is ok, and the facilities are not ordinary. The first room's network port is broken and you can't access the Internet. If you change the room, the water will not come out of the shower, and you are depressed. 
0	Ordinary tourist hotel is also three stars makes me sad. The name of the store is so big and the difference is extremely bad. Additional comments December 8, 2006: It also said that there is an underground garage. Who would dare to go down, dizzy, small and dark. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
0	"It is arranged near the elevator. Extremely noisy! The elephant lives in the airport. Additional comments June 19, 2008: Breakfast was good. If you use Ctrip's reservation, you can't use the ""You Yue"" card for points. "
1	The general feeling is ok, very quiet, and the room is good. Close to National Village and Haigeng Park, you can sit by Dianchi Lake in the evening and listen to the tides. The only downside is that it is inconvenient to take a taxi out at night, but the front desk is also prepared to call a taxi for you. Just say in advance. 
1	I bought this because I think this one looks good. I have been shopping in the market for a long time. Either I don’t have this one, or the price is unreasonable. After placing an order on JD.com, it arrived in two days and the things were very good. it is good 
1	We stayed in a standard guest room. Advantages: 1. The facilities are quite complete. 2. The location is good. Disadvantages: 1. The sound insulation is too poor. The sound of bathing in another room and the sound of turning on the faucet sounded in my ears. I don’t sleep well at night 2. The quilt feels really hard and uncomfortable 
1	The appearance is good, the interface is basically satisfactory, the screen is good enough, and the overall configuration is still better in the range of entry machines. I can still accept the heat, but I still bought a radiator. 
0	It is very simple, it is more suitable for babies under 1 year old, and the paper is not thick. It is recommended that this simple one can be made smaller for easy access. 
1	The standard room is large in size, but the room is old and has some smell. Breakfast is often chaotic. 
0	There are not many practical methods that can allow you to change your concept, but how do you do it after you change your concept? The books recommended in it are all foreign, and many are not suitable for China. 
1	The hotel is very good and you can make long-distance calls for free, and you don’t need to pay for it. This is more attractive

1	When I was in the secondary school, I heard my classmates introduce the specific plot of this book. I was very moved by it at that time, and it was told to me by my favorite girl. So, after borrowing this book, I read it eagerly and read it in one breath. It was really sad and moving, and it had the charm of the red mansion. Since then, I have always had a strong desire to own this book. Encountered some versions, the binding, quality, etc. have always made me unsatisfied. Fortunately for this version, not only hardcover, but also printing and binding, and the price is cheap. What are you waiting for? With the book in hand, I can't stop playing with it, and my excitement is hard to express. 
0	In fact, I have seen the first episode of the female psychologist on the Internet. I want to take a closer look and buy a copy on Dangdang. It’s really disgusting. It may be the reason for the piracy. The content of the book is missing. Ten pages, I will not buy books on Dangdang in the future! 
1	The price is really high, and there is no breakfast provided. Is the price Ctrip got bad? Or do you keep it unwilling to let our customers? Get the price at the front desk, 430 will do. 
0	"1. The camera 130W pixels, the QQ video is not particularly clear. 2. The display shows light leakage when viewed from the side nearly 180 degrees. 3. The vista system boot is a bit slow. 4. The most serious is the power adapter that is always ""squeaking"" Loud, very noisy, strongly request to change it! ! "
1	Beautiful appearance, white and suitable for girls. The stuff given is quite sufficient, first of all I saw a 250G hard drive. Better than HP's, it is too stingy to give 8G hard drives even solid state drives. This kind of book is similar to everyone, and it is worth buying an affordable one. 
1	The hotel is quite satisfactory as a four-star hotel, and the service attitude and facilities are still in the past. The western-style snacks in the lobby are good, with good quality and low price. Dissatisfaction: 1. There is no parking lot, and there is a charge for parking on the side of the road. It feels very uncomfortable, and friends who drive by themselves must be psychologically prepared. 2. Jiujiang seems to have no five-star hotel. First, I feel that the hotel is a four-star hotel. It should be more eye-catching. If anyone thinks this way, it is completely wrong. I didn't even see it after driving through the door twice, whether it was the building or the lobby. 
0	I advise the netizens of Ctrip not to stay in this hotel. This is the conclusion after my personal experience. I can tell you the facts: 1. The surrounding environment is too bad. We checked in at around 9pm on August 5th. There are no shops in the surrounding area. We only order food at the hotel. There is no one in the restaurant. We look for a waiter, and then the waiter finds the chef in the restaurant. If you don’t eat in the hotel, you can take a taxi to the ancient city of Dali. If you don’t, you can wait for the hotel’s shuttle bus to and from the ancient city. It takes about half an hour. 2. The furnishings of the room are not clean, there is no garbage bag on the trash can, and it is thrown directly in. The quality of slippers is too bad. The worst is toilet paper, which is very yellow and rough. 3. As soon as you check in, the few girls at the front desk of the hotel will tirelessly ask about your schedule for tomorrow, recommend a driver for you, or call a car for you. We were fooled by them: when they knew that we were going to Kunming from Dali tomorrow, they enthusiastically recommended their shuttle bus at 126 yuan, which is 40% more expensive than the normal passenger fare. My child is 9 years old. 1.3 meters, half of the ticket bought when I came to Dali from Lijiang, but this hotel asked us to go to Kunming to buy a full ticket, saying that this is a rule, we believed it, and paid, but later in the afternoon we arrived at their tourist bus stop (Yunnan Tourism Group Travel Express), the people in the station said that our children can buy half tickets, and they turned around and called the Santa Yard Hotel, hoping to help solve the ticket exchange and refund fees. They would not have the original enthusiasm. They dragged on to find a reason, no Li, in the end only we got on the car when it was time, and the car left. 4. What luxury bus recommended by this hotel is the Provincial Travel Express of Yunnan Tourism Group, you must not take it! The pick-up point in Dali was in the Cangshan Hotel. After the car was on the highway, the toilet in the car was not allowed. After arriving in Chuxiong, he entered a private restaurant next to the Chuxiong gas station and said that he would rest for half an hour. Take a break, because we are almost in Kunming, everyone wants to eat in Kunming, but the driver said arrogantly: You don’t eat, I’m still hungry, I want to eat! The last car of passengers was driven off and stood in the open space. The driver swaggered to eat. All the passengers waited for them to eat. It was delayed for more than 40 minutes. It was a little more than 8 o'clock to arrive in Kunming, but it was delayed until 9 o'clock. 
0	"Haha, after reading this book, I have to regret it, not for the money, but for the time. To be honest, apart from the missing corners of the book, I don’t think this book itself is worth reading. If anyone wants to see it, I can introduce it. Simply put, it is money worship. ""Love is not important, but money is especially important...... Give up your youthful thoughts and your childishness..."" Hehe, some opinions really disagree, including that since you will be very realistic when you are thirty, Then why is it realistic when you are not in your twenties? Oh my god, then I want to say that people of course have different ideas at different ages. It is impossible to have a twenty-year-old person like a sixty-year-old person. The point of view... and the author probably meant this... "
0	The service is ok! Others are about the same level as the guest house. The network is often bad! Not recommended! 
1	For a three-star hotel, they have done very well. The hotel has a good environment and is very convenient. The service staff are very hardworking. What is especially touched is that in the restaurant, I ask for ice water. The waiter always tires every time Do it (they do not have ice water but use boiling water and ice). The same goes for the front desk staff. I am patient in helping to call a taxi. The room is also good. Although there is no non-smoking room, there is no smoke in the room (5th floor). The downside is that there is mold on the bathtub wall. Unfortunately for me, the gym and the like are being renovated and I have no chance to use it. 
0	Why did I only order a day earlier, and then I started to send a lot of things. It was a mouse, a memory, and a Rising. It was really helpless 
0	Three Star? Exaggerated, really exaggerated! Poor environment, poor room, bed! worse! ! ! service? Shaking his head, only shaking his head! 
0	The screen at 14:9 is very uncomfortable. It’s a bit troublesome to install XP. The machine is a bit stuck. Sometimes it’s easy to freeze. The heat dissipation is too general. The graphics card is not very prominent. The keyboard is not very useful because it will press other keyboards. 
0	The decoration smell is too heavy, and the business standard room is too small. The reason is the peak season. When I checked out, I heard that the house price of the day had risen again. I had no choice but to raise the price. 
0	"The battery and wireless network card problems are as follows. There is no problem with the battery. Both charge and discharge are good. The wireless network card is suspicious. After running on battery power for 2 hours, the signal becomes poor, ""signal is very good"", becomes ""signal poor"" (the IBM signal running at the same time is very good); direct plug-in operation, the wireless connection is always good (4, 5h) "
0	The piano paint is contaminated with fingerprints and oil; the wireless network card is 5100, which can only support 150M ports; the body is too heavy, and the power supply is more than 6 kg. 
0	It’s not a small trouble to find an XP driver. The mouse is a bit small, it’s no problem for girls, but it’s not convenient for men! The video memory is DDR3. 
0	The left side of the whole machine is a little hot, and the USB port design is not very reasonable.There should also be a USB port on the right side. It is more troublesome to install the XP system, and it takes time to drive. 
0	"The shortcomings and advantages are equally obvious, that is, the wireless network card is equivalent and not stable. When I use it frequently, ""Wireless Network Connected"" appears in the lower right corner of the screen, indicating that the wireless is disconnected briefly and then connected again. Fortunately, I don’t play games, otherwise it will be troublesome? I wonder if there is any solution? "
1	Very satisfied with this choice. Jinbanna is really cost-effective. It's close to the city center, and the breakfast is rich. The villa-type house makes people return to nature. This 3 star product is genuine 
0	The content of this book is really not humorous. It is daydreaming if you want to read the book and try to remember English words. 
1	The price is very high and the price is very suitable! Delivery speed is okay. CPU performance is much better than intel at the same price. The key is that the price is cheaper, much cheaper than general malls. 
1	Hesse was born in a family of senior intellectuals. His father was a missionary, and his mother and grandfather were famous Indian historians. Since childhood, Hesse has a deep understanding and understanding of Indian history and religion. Siddhartha's path to the Tao is full of hardships, and Hesse's real life is also full of thorns. Perhaps in his heart, he is the son of this constantly sneaking Brahman, and he will eventually find a place in his soul that is bright and complete after searching again and again. There is a touch of Zen in the poetic and beautiful text. Definitely worth reading! 
1	The room is relatively clean, the bathroom is too small, and it is hard to turn around. Half of the geographical location, because it is in the alley, it is not easy to find. Service is average. 
0	This book is terrible. There is nothing to read aloud in the manual. I don't want to read it after reading a few pages. 
1	This set of books is a gift for my nephew on Children’s Day. I didn’t expect my two-and-a-half-year-old daughter to particularly like the dinosaur. But she thought it was too early, and she went back to her hometown on the Dragon Boat Festival and took it back to her nephew. I like it very much, but after the next morning, he read three books at a stretch. He can basically read it by himself when he is a first-year elementary school...The little guy likes it very much. I personally think this set of books can increase the children's Knowledge, broaden children's horizons, especially suitable for children in elementary school to read. 
1	In addition, the werewolves described in the book are all unusually tall, and the Jacob in the book is taller than Sam and Edward. But the actor who played Jacob in the first film seems to be only slightly taller than Bella and half a head shorter than Edward. I am a little disappointed. I don’t know how the director will show the heroic appearance of the giant wolf in the second film. I look forward to it. ...... 
0	Only slogans, no depth. Disorganization is just a waste of our time. But the target audience may be different. It is recommended to look at Guoxue, but to look at Nan Huaijin. The depth, breadth, thoroughness, rigorous and humble attitude, among these so-called scholars, it is difficult to find someone like Nan Huaijin. 
1	Very good, this time staying at the hotel helped me upgrade to a business room for free, saying it was a year-end discount for Ctrip. I was unexpectedly satisfied. Hotel Feedback January 16, 2008: Thank you for your satisfaction and support for Dalian Yinfan Hotel! The business room is a brand-new room type that is two levels higher than the basic room type deluxe room. The year-end rebate business room upgrade activity is currently 498 yuan. I hope everyone will like our new room and the new Yinfan more! Welcome to Yinfan Hotel! 
0	The sound is a bit small, and installation is not an ordinary difficulty. Fortunately, a colleague has stayed in the Computer City to get it done. 
1	1. External CD-ROM drive, directly press F11 to enter the CD-ROM to start the xp installation when booting up. It will be completed in half an hour. Replace the CD-ROM with the attached xp driver to install and fix it. Super light and easy to carry. Get a special price for lp 
0	Who said it was good, I bought it too. But I don't understand, my mother said it was useless. Hey. . . . . . . . 
1	For a fourth-grade son, it is a bit difficult to read. Because the front of each essay is very long, and it is a translation, some of it is a bit hard to read, so I guess he will have no interest. But I didn’t expect it, I like it Look, before going to bed at night, always watch it for a while. After reading it, I told me that the author’s article is very in-depth and his writing technique is quite special. Basically, you have to see at the end to know what happened. I said that I would learn this writing in the future. When he heard him so thoughtful, I quickly bought him some books on Dangdang. 
0	The driver given by the official is not flattering. The machine I just bought is already very stuck in the game, which caused me to download the latest version from the official website of the graphics card. After that, it was more fun to play. 
0	The content of the book is rather rigid, and you will find it boring if you read it. It should still be ok in terms of application. 
0	The partition has only one C drive and no CD-ROM drive. The backup system is troublesome. If you partition randomly, it is likely to destroy the backup system 
0	There was a buckle behind the battery that did not get in, and I pressed it in hard. After the book is buckled, the buckle is not very neat. Seen from the side, the right side is hanging in the air. I don't know whether it is the upper board or the lower board. 
1	The hotel is nice and the restaurant is very tasty. The traffic is also very convenient, there are squares and big shopping malls nearby 
0	After reading it all, I don't know how to tell the child. The first volume is a little hen. If you don't lay the eggs well, you go out to watch the sea. This is nothing in itself and acceptable. Later, the plot was that he encountered a little cock. He was very handsome, so he brought home and got married. . . . . . It feels that it is still not in line with China's ethics and morals. I hope buyers will think twice. Six of my own are brand new and sold at a discount. I'm not going to tell the kids 
0	Delivery is slow, and there are small defects on the edge of the display. Other buyers should pay attention. It took 5 days for delivery in the same city. I still call to urge the delivery. I don’t understand it, and the vista system is relatively rubbish. 
0	"There is nothing to say about the good air. Fish spa reduces a lot of dead skin. The hot spring is indeed good outdoors (although it is not very deep, people can't stand up), but there are too many places to strengthen the service. First, the breakfast is about to end at 9:30. I arrived at the restaurant at about 9:25. The welcoming guests in the restaurant did not inform in advance. After entering, the breakfast was almost received. I grabbed a large plate of rice noodles from the waiter and basically did not eat To what. Second, there are no safes in the rooms on the second floor. Is this one floor short of it? Third, the waiters in the Chinese restaurant gather in Batai to chat when there is nothing to do. The service is basically self-service. Fourth, the hot spring service is not very good. We went to three people together to do pedicures. While we were waiting for the waiter, one of them ran away because he didn’t know the other person asked him to do pedicures. After the waiter came, he went out to look for him. He didn't know it and said he didn't do it. The waiter ran away. After he came in again to find out, he asked the waiter again. I couldn't invite him. These two helped us to do it After that, they all fled and left. No one can be called anymore. Fourth, the towels in the hot springs must be optimistic. Many unconscious tourists throw their own towels on the ground or get wet, and just take others and put them away. There is a big problem with the towel management of the hot spring. We originally booked two rooms. My room was changed due to temporary incidents. I told Ctrip that I had changed it. Because of the above treatment, my friend had to end the trip early. It seems that there is another one called ""Nanyuan"" nearby, but it seems that I haven't found it on Ctrip. I don't know what will happen to that one? "
1	I bought it for the second time. It was translated by Zhou Kexi and Ike. I bought two copies each for a friend. 
0	Although TV, Internet and other media have hyped Dan, I don't appreciate her comments on the Analects. Perhaps the benevolent see benevolent, and the wise see wisdom. 
1	The room is a bit small. No other problems. It’s good. Last time I stayed with a Japanese guest. They liked it because there was NHK 
0	I originally bought a set and intended to give it to my parents, hoping that they are in good health, but I saw some first, and the overall feeling is exaggerated and hollow. The thinking of the whole book is also very confusing, it seems that I can write whatever I think of, so that there are many similar contents in the three sets of books. Many acupuncture points did not specify how to find them. I personally feel that the cases in the book are not convincing. I read so many good reviews that I bought a set without even thinking about it, but to me I was very disappointed and didn't dare to send it out. I was skeptical about the content of this book. 
0	Strongly not recommended. I ordered a luxury room. When I arrived at the front desk, I actually said that I didn’t make a reservation. I was frustrated for a long time. I didn’t have a good service attitude when staying in a hotel on a business trip. I was really unhappy. Then I went upstairs to the 5th floor. The elevator didn’t know how it broke. Now, when asked what to do about the service desk and whether it can be repaired, she said coldly: Climb the stairs! I have a big baggage! The room is relatively small, and the cleanliness is average. It is far from the introduction. For example, the bath towels are all broken and shredded. They are very disgusting. The TV remote control is not easy to use, and I need to work. Those who use the Internet, but promised to have a network cable in the room, there is indeed a network cable, but can not be connected to the Internet for three days, the phone to the front desk, either said that there is no problem, or that the machine is broken, can not be repaired today, have to wait for tomorrow. If it weren't for the points I have already set, I would have replaced it a long time ago, which would be very uncomfortable. There are many hotels in the surrounding area, so we advise you to think twice before staying and choose those with better reputation and better stars. Additional comments July 1, 2008: The breakfast provided is really not eatable, and the soundproofing effect of the room is extremely poor. The corridors are added up and down, and the sound is super annoying, which seriously affects the rest! 
1	Good heat dissipation, clear screen, good keyboard feel, fast processing speed, low hard drive sound, good workmanship 
0	I originally booked for 3 nights. I couldn’t stand it for 2 nights. The first night I went to Guiyang was staying at Jinjiang Flower Hotel. The next day I entrusted Ctrip to help me book 3 nights at Ruijin Hotel. The TV I got married 11 years ago was still broken, the waiters were too poor, and they didn’t even have basic courtesy, as if I owed them something in my previous life; I knocked on the door and opened it immediately. I’m still in the room. No time 
0	"In Dangdang, the one-time order is more than 600 yuan, but the delivery person only delivers the goods downstairs, saying: ""Your book is so heavy, I only earn you 1.5 yuan, I can't send you upstairs. If you don't take it yourself , Then I will take the book away."" I don't know why the conflict between you has to involve our consumers. We did not pay a penny less. Please Dangdang give me a reasonable explanation. "
0	If it's not that I can't book other hotels, I can't live here! Poor conditions are bad, and the price is not cheap. I plan not to go there again for at least 50 years. I suggest Ctrip delete this hotel. 
0	Our hotel was framed to consume more items in the room. We booked two rooms. I only consumed one Wanglaoji. The other room had no consumption. Then I came up with my room and consumed four things and the other room. Three things. Because we checked out by phone at noon, we only checked out at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. They said that the room was cleaned and could not be verified. Damn, should I check the items in the room carefully when I stay in the hotel! Either the waiter steals things, or the hotel blackmails, and at the same time, we are fortunate that we carry all the valuables with us, without causing greater losses. In a hurry to catch a plane, the only option is to pay to leave. This will be my last stay at this hotel. I am responsible for my remarks, my personal information Ctrip has! 
0	After buying this set of books, my daughter likes it very much, and I like it personally. I often read with my children. The exquisite pictures and vivid language make children have a great interest in reading. I recommend everyone to buy this set of books for their children. . 
1	"Cuihua said: Just call me ""Deputy Chief""... Wu Tianshu became the same deputy director-level cadre like her. In the novel, similar self-ridicules and AQS-style comfort Bibijie are, also Let us experience the pleasure and joy of harvesting in this self-reflection. The text is smooth, straightforward, and a bit of pseudo-farmer-like wisdom, which makes people can't help but read it without wasting brain cells. It is an absolute small Shenyang-like blockbuster. The diary of Wu Tianshu at the beginning of each chapter is absolutely magical, good book, good book. Have you gotten the deputy office today, haha~~` "
0	The operating system is too mentally installed! It is actually divided into 2 areas, one is the ASUS tool area, and the remaining capacity is divided into one large area to install winxp! Which of the computers you can use is not a separate data area; not to mention that the system only needs 20G. I had to re-partition and install the system if I got it, it was very popular! 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, the keyboard is also very beautiful, the screen is not bright but not bright. The only thing that makes me sleepless in the middle of the night is that XP drivers are really hard to find T.T 
1	I originally booked an ordinary standard room, but I realized that there was no room at the front desk, so I upgraded to a deluxe double room that is not available on Ctrip. The room is small but very clean. I am very satisfied. Diagonally opposite the hotel is a store specializing in Russian products. You can walk to the riverside within a few steps along Yanlu. The scenery is not bad. If you are on business next time, you will stay here. 
0	When I got home, I found that the plastic cover on the bottom of the cpu and memory was not tight, and it was still tilted. I smashed the cover twice with my hand. Big brands like Lenovo shouldn't make such low-level mistakes. Isn't Lao Liu relegated to the second line No one cares about the quality afterwards? 
0	The product introduction does not explain how to install XP. Fortunately, I have XP with Sata driver. 
0	XP is more difficult to do, but after a lot of hard work, the installation of XP is successful, with a lot of drivers and shortcut keys! 
0	The quality of the book is very good, the paper is very thick, the pictures are very beautiful, the pictures are big, but they are all naive, not suitable for children in third grade, (my daughter is in third grade), my daughter said she did not like it, especially an English book The word book is purely a collection of words. 
0	One is that the heat generated at the left hand rest is a bit high, many people have mentioned. The second is that the speaker effect is really not good. Friends who are going to buy a lot of music to appreciate it suggest not to consider this. The third is that it is too difficult for people who are not familiar with computers to install the XP system, but this should not be considered as its shortcoming. 
1	It is said that TINKPAD has been a domestic product for several years, but black fans always believe that others are IBM’s things. This is certain. Technically, regardless of hardware or software, Xiaohei is always the industry leader. The lightness really made me relieved. I used it before. The most awesome T series is a bit cumbersome. The most gratifying thing is that the black screen effect has finally improved a bit, and the entertainment function has also been strengthened a lot. 
1	This book is the first book I read by Linda, and it was this book that attracted me to buy a set of his books. As a Chinese who has lived in the West for a long time, he introduced the West in this way , Still very few. For a person who wants to understand the truth about American democracy and freedom, this is a very good set of books. I also suspected that this set of books may beautify the American system, but in the end this doubt was dispelled, because the author At the same time, he also wrote about the price Americans paid for this system. Life is precious, love is more expensive, if it is for freedom, both can be thrown away? How many Chinese are willing to throw away their lives for freedom? 
0	The drivers of the wireless network card and the cat in the driver CD are not clear. Two are provided. I don’t know which is the correct one. I try to use one, but I don’t know which one is wrong. It causes the machine to crash when entering XP. Reinstalling XP is all right. Do not install the drivers for these two devices, wait for the expert to answer 
1	The workmanship is OK, and the appearance is good! The operation (I mainly use it only for office) is not slow. 
1	I used the EX400, this time I helped my classmates choose this one. I feel that both are very good. This one has a big screen and cool. 
1	"Qing Chuanwen, the first book I read is ""Fengwu Daqing"", the second and last book is ""Don't Forget""! Two complete styles, each with its own characteristics! But I prefer ""Don't Forget""! That faint sadness may make me unable to let go for a long time~~~~~ There is always a feeling of despair! But it is different with love, and don't forget because of love! ! ! So, never see through it! ! ! ~~~ "
1	Orders were placed at 8 pm on the first day, and more goods were delivered at 3 pm the next day. The xp driver installs the F8vr series, and there is a download on the official website. The in-depth xp system I used, installed smoothly 
0	It's really not like a four-star hotel. All three stars think it is high. The rooms are very small and very old. It feels messy everywhere. The lobby on the first floor is very noisy. 
0	Books are relatively thick. S10E is much heavier. The keys under the touchpad are so hard. Bad service! The customer service phone was very difficult to make, and asked if there was an inner bag, and said no. Some actually sent. It made me buy a bag for nothing, and I cannot return it partially. Fortunately, the red bag is very beautiful, so forget it. . 
0	I had a headache when I saw English, and this book failed to bring up my interest in English. After reading it for a few pages, I gave it to my colleague. It also put a lot of dust on my colleague's desk!

0	"The waiter in the restaurant was not friendly, and some of the free breakfasts were not served at 8 in the morning (steamed eggs and fried rice noodles). The little girl negotiated with the waiter twice and the breakfast was served until 9 in the morning. Hope The hotel should improve the breakfast supply. The room attendants should be trained. When the guest’s door lock is hung with the words ""Do Not Disturb"", they hope that they will not enter the guest room without authorization. This is a respect for the guests. "
1	Thinkpad, an iron brand given to Lenovo, still has a strong brand effect on consumers, and this brand is enough to attract attention. The overall configuration is relatively reasonable, quite satisfactory, with no outstanding features, and no shortcomings. General mobile commerce can be satisfied. Comrades who play games, please take a stand alone. 
0	1. For a plain text Linux system, installing windows is more troublesome. Press F2 to enter the BIOS settings and change a sata parameter to IDE. Otherwise, the installation program cannot recognize the hard disk and cannot be changed back. It seems that the impact is not great; 2. The driver installation is not intelligent 
0	After configuration and adding a 1G memory, it is perfect to install the XP system. It is almost a difficult thing to complete. Installing the vista system has a partition error problem. No PCMCIA interface. Pay attention to the quality of the shell when buying a wireless network card. 
0	GL40, waste T4200 and DDR3. No Bluetooth. The keyboard has a large gap, which makes it easy to get dust. There seems to be a dark spot on the right side, which is not obvious and needs further testing. Personally think 16:9 is not as comfortable as 16:10, and it is too wide. The Rising sent is useless, it is better to replace it with a mouse. 
1	I went to Wuhu to have a wedding wine for my nephew, 10 people, booked 5 standard rooms on the 24th to 26th. I read the reviews before staying, and I had lingering fears. After I lived, I felt better than expected. In such a city, the price should be more than Not bad. Disadvantages, living on the 4th floor, there is a large platform in front of the window, and the view outside the window is not good. I love photography, but I am a little sorry. 
0	I bought the LINUX version, and installed XP back to my death. It's better to give me a bare machine with only DOS, and it is easy to install the system. The keyboard seems to be relatively loose, there is a key, accidentally clicked out. The notebook is small, but it feels a bit heavy, probably because of the battery. 
1	The books are of good quality and trustworthy; in addition, Jingdong's service is indeed fast and the service attitude is also very good. give it a like! ! ! ! 
0	The price/performance ratio is extremely low, and it is not up to the 4-star standard. Single breakfast is provided, breakfast is charged separately, 68 yuan/person, and the Internet fee is 60 yuan/day. Never stay again next time! 
1	The service attitude is very good, hehe, and very close to where we go, very convenient, the environment is also very good, I hope I can live there next time 
0	It's a bit heavy, but it's acceptable. The speed is not as fast as expected. I don't know if it is because of the configuration problem or because of the Vista system. Ready to add a memory stick and look again. 
1	The hotel is nice and the restaurant is very tasty. The traffic is also very convenient, there are squares and big shopping malls nearby 
1	The screen is perfect, the machine is beautiful, the legendary long standby time, the battery has not been tested yet. Jingdong delivery is very fast, 18 hours from order to receipt, like one 
0	The bag I sent was too big to fit my 15-inch notebooks; I should send the matching small bag instead. Just need to add an inner bag. 
1	The appearance is OK, but the system is really difficult to install. The GHOST version of XP can’t be installed at all in the LINUX system. 
1	The function is very complete, the speed is also good, the weight is light at 14 inches. I wanted to buy a lighter and smaller one, the price would be much higher, so let’s do it. 
0	After I received the goods, I watched a few discs seriously, which were much worse than I expected. There are many snowflakes on the screen, which has a great impact on my eyes. 
1	Indeed, many of the contents in the book are appalling, and the confidentiality of some historical materials even makes people doubt their authenticity. Although the author has a special industry background, some details still seem sensational. Apart from the suspicion about the credibility of the data source, this book is indeed a vivid textbook for Chinese and non-financial people. It can make people interpret historical events from a new perspective and uncover the so-called Historical celebrities, historical wars, and the mysterious and sacred veils of international organizations have given more thought to the nature of things. 
0	I have read Yu Dan's book and I want to buy the genuine one on Dangdang. Why don't I have a library ticket? There is no bookmark in the original book, disappointed! 
0	"This is a worthless book. Do you need to explain such a simple truth? Moreover, the explanation is not wonderful. It is a popular product and has a reputation. After reading this book, the author is at this level, and the author ""Zhuangzi"" is determined not to buy it. "
0	This set of cats and mice was originally intended to be given to friends, but more than ten sets were delivered for the first time. Every one of them was well packaged and the quality was problematic. According to the delivery, it is more troublesome to exchange the goods. It is better to return the goods directly and place the order again. This is repeated several times, but the quantity I want has not been delivered. No way to complain! ! ! ! Sadly! ! ! ! But in general, this set of discs can only be said to be of high quality and low price. After reading it, it is found that it is not genuine and the image quality is average. Give it to you to think clearly! 
1	"After I have been to Japan, I am very grateful that this book has saved me countless times, especially in a country where English is not spoken. I feel very helpless without it. Even my wife praised that what I bought was very practical. After 3 hours on the Shinkansen, I listened to the mp3 that came with it, mastered some common words, and learned some common tones. People in the same group praised me as ""professional."" Ha ha "
0	Unfortunately, the book I sent yesterday was returned by me. The reason was that when I received the book, I found the book was broken in the middle. I ordered three books. The book was caught in the middle but it was badly damaged. Obviously it was before mailing. It has been damaged. 
0	Just 5 minutes after I received the book, I ran to give feedback. It was really fun, the book was wide and wide, and the silly cats on the cover were very funny. I didn't care to read it, hehe, I will share it with you after reading it! !!Lala 
0	The JD product is not the correct version. It is obviously model U100, but the webpage and invoice are U100X, and the silver reflective label on MSI says U100 Plus on the hand rest. Seriously, the keyboard feels so-so. Due to the use of 6 CELL batteries, the battery will protrude. 
1	It was just set for 4499, and it rose by 200 that afternoon. It was very comfortable to use, and there were no other shortcomings. 
0	"Stayed here on March 28th and March 29th for two nights, 118 per night, the hotel room is poorly decorated, the door is loose and loose and cannot be locked (relying on a button to prevent full opening). The bathroom part of the bathroom is a lead pipe Hanging her head, I arrived too late in the evening on the 28th and did not wash. On the 29th, she found that there was no hot water. After responding to the waiter, her first reaction was: ""You reversed the direction of the hot and cold water."" I stayed here 2 Can't tell the difference between hot and cold water at night? Then: ""You have to put it on for a while."" She put it on herself, but it was not warm enough to take a bath. In view of the quick one-day experience in Xining, I asked her to talk to the boiler room and raise the water temperature. She said: ""Our masters are all professional and know what to do."" After half an hour without hot water, we decided to go to the ""Xinhua Hotel"" (next to Xinhua Bookstore) as suggested by other netizens. The decoration was much better than this one, only 100 nights. Summary: The facilities are almost okay, but the customer's fault is the customer's fault when the waiter speaks. The customer is not professional enough and the customer doesn't know anything. It doesn't matter if we can't live like this. So score 1 point. Hotel Feedback April 24, 2008: First of all, thank you VIPs for their valuable comments to our hotel. After seeing your comments, we attach great importance to it and immediately made improvements. The magnetic card lock in the guest room comes with a self-locking, and guests are absolutely assured of safety. The hotel is known for its safety. There are security guards and service personnel on duty 24 hours a day. Each corridor has public areas with closed-circuit monitoring. The hotel implements militarized management. Some rooms in the north building only have showers. If you need a bathtub, you can ask our staff to change rooms, or indicate the room with a bathtub in the reservation form. Due to the large number of our rooms, the boiler room is a bit far away from a few rooms, and the water pipeline is correspondingly longer. Therefore, these rooms need to drain the cold water in the pipeline to have hot water. The hot water in this hotel is guaranteed to have a minimum water temperature It cannot be lower than 75 degrees to deliver to the guest rooms, but for this situation, it may be that our staff did not explain clearly to the VIP guests, and there are also shortcomings in the tone. This hotel apologizes to the VIP guests. The hotel has taken the matter seriously. Our hotel must prevent this from happening again. We hope that you will be able to provide you with better service next time you stay at our hotel, and we will make more valuable suggestions to the hotel in the future. All staff of Lhasa Plaza Hotel sincerely welcome you. Thank you again for your comment on my hotel. "
1	"I don't know Gao Heng's experience very well, but it is a poem written by Mao Zedong. Does the ""revolutionary"" language of works during the Cultural Revolution reflect the weakness of a traditional literati? Or is it the self-existence behavior of a wise man who understands the past and the present? Easy way, you can cultivate Qi Zhiping, and you can live in troubled times. Has Mr. Gao reached this level? "
1	In the context of a specific story, the author described such an indifferent and unrequited story. She wanted to live the life she wanted, but she did not reject the passive arrangement of life. Some things happened gradually made her grow and change, but After all, what changed was only some understanding. For what she pursued, she never gave up and couldn't stay with each other, so she fell in love with the rivers and lakes... Given a poor life experience, given all the pains and talents, he gained her heart and pain And happy... 
1	It can take about 5-6 hours to turn on the wireless, how come eight hours? 2799-50, the price was more expensive than NG, but NG was out of stock. 
0	The shell material is slightly rough; the shell thickness is thin; the mono speaker is very inhumane; but it is not bad for such a price. 
1	This time I went to Beijing, I was going to Beijing Normal University to do errands, so I paid special attention to the nearby hotel. After staying for two days, the hotel is very easy to find. It is very close to Xisi Street, and the bus Huguosi stop is a two-minute walk away. Because it is close to the bus station, it is convenient to take the bus, which saves money and trouble. There are many snack bars outside the hotel, the price is cheaper than Wangfujing snack street, the newspaper hall on Huguosi Street, 2 cents a minute public long-distance phone, fruit stand, 24-hour convenience store, Internet cafes everything, very convenient. The rooms are very clean. In this respect, the three-star ones I have stayed in Beijing are not as good as this two-star one. The heating in the room is also turned on enough. The disadvantage is that the water temperature during the shower is too low, and it is hot and cold. I don't know why. The socket in the bathroom cannot be charged, and there is no socket under the window cabinet, so it can only be charged behind the TV cabinet, which is not convenient. In addition, the cigarettes in the hotel opposite the hotel cannot be bought. Most of them are fake. The hotel staff are very friendly and feel good. Recommend one! 
0	"I thought it was the original version of ""Lust, Caution?"", but I didn't expect it to be a collection of Zhang Ailing's works. It's boring. Dangdang like this should be explained in the introduction. "
1	After waiting for a month, I finally got one. The small book is very beautiful, the sapphire blue looks very textured, the overall workmanship is very good, it runs XP immediately after booting, it is smooth, watching movies, listening to music, the effect is good, and the Internet speed is also Not bad. The six-cell battery has great battery life. Now Jingdong’s distribution speed has been greatly improved, praise! 
0	Why can’t I find the acupuncture points? I always feel that the book is a bit bragging, especially the preface that scares people like a master in martial arts. 
0	Floating keyboard~! I really don’t know what the designer thinks. The recognition rate of the lower part of the button is very low ~ Press 10 times and recognize 5 times is not bad, and the floating keyboard is easy to accumulate dust! Also, it is very thick and not finely crafted 
0	The content of the book is very good. I bought a set for my daughter before, and my daughter liked it very much. I also want to give a set to the teacher’s child because it’s almost past Children’s Day. I bought it myself and the interval between purchases was not enough. Half a month, but it can be delivered by express delivery, cash on delivery, but this time, you have to pay first, and you have to send it by surface mail, so it takes a week longer than the last time, and it takes 11 days to receive Goods. After receiving the goods, I was even more disappointed. The original plastic film was all damaged. A set of four books with 16 folds was still folded. After the book was opened, it was damaged, and the writing still showed signs of breaking. How can I give it away? Because I often read my children’s books, I can’t bring them to give away. I received this kind of goods and saw this kind of service. It’s so disappointing. I have purchased books many times in Dangdang, express delivery I was very satisfied with the books I received. This time, the books I wanted to give away made me very embarrassed and angry. I hope that Dangdang's service can be normal and not to change. If it is still by surface mail, I am not there. I bought your book. At the same time, I also bought the magic school bus. The outer skin of the book is damaged, but there is no crease, which is better than the appearance of that set of books. 
0	I originally wanted to throw away the packing box or something, but I told me to take away everything and keep it. Otherwise, the repair or return would not work, causing me to carry a large bag of boxes. 
0	If xp is pre-installed, it will be perfect. The screen doesn't feel perfect, but it always feels a little white. For example, if I type now, it is black, but the computer always feels that it is not so black and the color is not so good, but if people lie down and the computer stays in the previous state, the effect is good. 
0	Recommend Tianmuhu Hotel, it is much better than this one in all aspects. It is worth recommending that their restaurant is decent, and fish heads can be eaten. But the service of the front desk lady is too bad. 
1	Cost-effective and fast. The motherboard of the 780 is also very good. It hardly feels hot. Except for the touchpad, the appearance is very elegant and wear-resistant. 
1	It just doesn’t look good in the picture, and the heat dissipation is good. The touch button on the right feels a little design failure, and it’s a bit thick. The 16:9 screen is just right for the opening ceremony. 
0	As a novel describing the emotional life of the past years, the author obviously lacks life experience and has a very average writing skills. After reading it, it feels a waste of time. It is not worth reading or recommending. The past times described by Zhang Xianliang, Liang Xiaosheng and other writers seem to be more nostalgic and emotional. This book is obviously not of a grade. 
1	Perfect metal shell, perfect keyboard feel, and the accuracy of the overall mold is commendable. A VGA interface is a must for me. The built-in Hitachi 250G hard drive claims to have a speed of 7200, 5400 heat and power consumption (5.5 w), the actual use is much faster than the 1.8-inch Toshiba disk of mini1000. 
0	The price cut is too fast! ! ! ! ! ! Other Asus series, such as N80, have not dropped so much price so quickly, it has exceeded my psychological tolerance limit! @! ! ! ! ! 
0	At first glance, I think that many aspects are good, but after carefully doing it, I feel that some things are also made by the author, and they are rarely translated. 
1	Small, quiet, beautiful appearance, long-lasting battery Small, quiet, beautiful appearance, long-lasting battery, Jingdong delivery is fast! 
1	Very nice hotel. I live in Building No. 8. The facilities are quite new, the service attitude is very good, the porter is very attentive, and the breakfast is also quite rich (breakfast is an important criterion for judging the level of the hotel), the details are better, than many listed four stars Better. The location should be pretty good. Will live next time I go. 
1	I believe that the quality of Zhaoyang is better than those of L3000 and TP sl series. The price is also good. And I ordered the computer to become a pre-order when I shipped the order. The delivery is very fast. I placed the order yesterday afternoon. Arrived 
1	The price is high, the quality is also very good, the keyboard is easy to press. The system is installed directly after booting, and it is really brand new. Comes with XP system, good battery life, perfect screen, wireless network card support n 
0	Ctrip service staff recommended this hotel to me on the phone and explained to me that it is a four-star hotel and the customer reviews are very good. After moving in, I wonder if such a hotel would have a good evaluation? After logging on to Ctrip, I found out that the user rating of this hotel is only 2.2! This is how good Ctrip calls it? ? ! ! ! This is the worst hotel in the world I have ever stayed in! Look at the room first: on the elevator, the corridor is dark! No lights turned on! It is estimated that there will be no residents for a long time. When the door is opened, the peculiar smell rushes! Look at the wall, the wallpaper on the wall has fallen off. Looking at the carpet, it is dirty and uneven. It is obvious that the hotel does not have a vacuum cleaner or does not use a vacuum cleaner. Looking at the toilet, there are large yellow scales. Looking at the window, one of the two screws on the handle of the bed opened! Watching TV again is the kind that we all eliminated at the end of the last century. The picture tube has been aging. When the main white picture is played on the TV, nothing can be seen. Only white horizontal bars can be seen, accompanied by a large TV noise. ! Environment: With such a room, what kind of environment can there be? Service: Not even the waiters are recruited yet! Most waiters are slow to respond and are not accustomed to politeness during telephone communication. After talking on the phone, they hang up without a goodbye. When you hang up, you feel dizzy and don't know if she agrees to your request. Seeing guests is like seeing strangers, but there is no doorman at the door. Summary: If it's not for my colleagues to find trouble, I will definitely change to another hotel. Advise all brothers on business trips to stay in a hotel like home instead of staying here. It will only be worse than you think, not better than you think! I feel very sad about Ctrip's recommendation! It is estimated that this hotel gives a lot of rebates. Such a Ctrip recommendation will only cause me to distrust Ctrip in the future! And tell my colleagues, don't trust Ctrip! I want to say: The benefits of deception cannot last long, and it is no different from drinking Zhen to quench thirst! 
1	The all-black appearance is suitable for men. It looks good, and the workmanship is good. The keyboard, battery, and fan are all satisfactory. 
1	The story is wonderful. Although the author's intention can be figured out through the title and plot of the book in the mid-term, the half-talk of the author succeeded in making the ending unexpected. The book is known for its plot, but it still hasn't escaped the traditional writing of multiple geniuses who laid out the game and sympathized with each other. From the nutritional point of view of books, there is nothing commendable. There are many detective books that can be read in 3 and a half hours with the original price of 28 yuan and will not be touched again. However, the meticulous plot and narrative style still make the book enjoyable in its pastime function. In general, it's okay. 
1	Very cost-effective. Many people are not familiar with the dairy cow brand, but the quality is actually very good. A few of my friends are using them, and they don’t turn off for 24 hours, but the desktop computer, downloading movies, and playing games, used it for almost a year. And the touch volume control is very cool. 
0	The battery does not work. After 12 hours of continuous charging for 3 times, the battery can only last for 1 hour and 40 minutes. When the remaining battery power is 99%, it shows that there is 1 hour and 59 minutes of available power, and the actual use is 1 hour and 40 minutes. 
1	The overall feeling is that the room facilities are very old, the walls and carpets are dirty, and there are many scratches and holes, but it seems that the entire Guiyang building is very shabby, the bathroom is very clean, the towels and toiletries are very complete, the TV received a lot of stations and the arrangement is relatively There are few rooms with orderly internet and there are few charges and it is very inconvenient to go out across the overpass on the right hand side and then cross a corner on the right. The total is less than 300 meters. There is an Internet cafe. The 24-hour service is very thoughtful. The language is standard. Kind and natural. Hand in the room card If there is a problem, the response time is 10 yuan and 8 breakfast is wrong. There are porridge and hot milk. 
0	Really bad hotel, poor service attitude. I was still locked in the elevator, suffering! Breakfast is special! It is better to choose the lakeside hotel to stay in Qiqihar. 
0	It is said to be the best hotel in Taicang. Being a 5-star hotel disappointed me. The rooms are small, simple and outdated, at most they are only 3 stars; the service is just that the front desk staff is good when checking in, and the others are too bad: the hotel staff and the doorman are blind when entering and leaving the hotel, let alone any expressions It’s a greeting. When I returned to the hotel, a female employee in black uniform in front of me walked to the elevator. I followed. When she reached the elevator, she turned and went up the stairs without giving me a button. Get off the elevator-I was carrying things in both hands and she knew I was following her. But the hotel's breakfast is still ok. Estimated not to live next time. 
1	The price of Tianfu Sunshine is relatively reasonable. The hardware is also good. The waiters were very nice. When I checked in, the lobby was being decorated. This restaurant is foreign-related, and many outsiders have disadvantages: breakfast is relatively simple and not very tasty 
0	how to say. In terms of room prices and room quality in places like Beijing. The price is already considered cheap. Because I stayed in several Beijing hotels before, they were all expensive and poor service and the rooms were quite small. The rooms in Ping An House are not big. Especially the toilets are too small. The windows of the room are facing the wall and the heating equipment. The windows cannot be opened at all. The windows are too noisy and can not get in the sun. Moreover, there is no elevator in the hotel. , No one in the middle service staff came to help. When I went to checkout, the front desk gave a VIP card, saying that next time you come to call us directly to book, our price is cheaper than Ctrip! 
1	Stayed for three nights from July 23rd to July 26th, 338 big bed room, the bed is 2 meters * 2 meters, super cool, other room facilities are average, a little bit outdated, but the impact is not big, it is not as shabby Go far! The overall feeling is that the price is basically acceptable, but if compared with the hotel's four-star brand, it is at most three-star standards! There is a problem that the hotel should pay attention to. I don’t know if this is a case or a common phenomenon-the phone in the room is unavailable, even local calls are charged, and a deposit must be paid before it can be opened. In this regard, I am in the hotel. The first time I met it was indeed a bit exaggerated. Now that it's open, just withdraw the phone, so as not to look anxious. Hotel Feedback August 11, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay in our hotel and for your valuable comments. We will also make corrections in time for your comments. We have reported to the leaders that the leaders have also given instructions in time, and the local calls will be free for guests staying in business rooms in the future. I hope you can choose to stay in our hotel next time and give us more valuable opinions. Only in this way will our hotel continue to improve. Finally, thank you again! 
0	It’s a bit heavier. The mirror screen is easy to leave fingerprints and scratches on the top cover. The Rising anti-virus software sent with it reports that the password is incorrect. I don’t know how to make it. 
1	"Checking in the hotel, I was told that the guest in the double bed room had not refunded, and gave me a free ""upgrade"" into a standard room. Unfortunately, I came with my lover, not on a business trip. Hey, I was a bit disappointed. But the location of the hotel is good, and it has been repaired these days Road, but the pavement is covered with plastic film, no dust, no big impact, the room is quiet, and the interior decoration details of the room are good. The staff has a good service attitude and praise. The room water heater cannot be used, immediately contact the front desk and solve the problem in 2 minutes. Bringing new ones, praise. The general feeling of this trip to Dunhuang: the people there are simple and the service attitude is good. I passed by a hotel ""Dunhuang Feitian Hotel"", and when I was tired, I went to the lobby to rest, and the hotel staff brought thirst quenching tea. This is the quality of the software, this is the details. The best breakfast in the morning is millet porridge, which is quite good. Hotel feedback July 15, 2008: Thank you for your feedback on Dunhuang Hotel, which is very helpful to improve our work efficiency and quality. Importantly, every employee of Dunhuang Hotel will work hard to provide guests with high-quality services. Welcome to Dunhuang again! "
0	The translation language of the book is average, and it is not easy to read. I bought it after reading the reviews, but that is not the case, and there is not much scientific reasoning. Not worth buying. 
0	The design is general, especially the closing and opening of the screen does not fit well, and the wireless network card access is not very stable (after it is disconnected, it will not be connected again). The mouse touch did not find the settings, the machine is a bit heavy! It's a bit heavy if you always carry it with you! 
1	As a classic textbook that stands tall, what Niusch teaches is not pure technology, but philosophy. Not indoctrination, but interactive thinking. Judging from the content of the book, although part of the content is a bit outdated for today's advanced digital imaging, the nature of photography as a technical industry will not change. For the creation of photography, the human concept is to create a good photo. The decision is, in today’s era when all kinds of so-called “themed photography” are flooded, what are the “good photos” we are really happy to accept? It's worth going back to the original point and thinking about it~ 
0	For the third year of living alone, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment, right? This book feels incomprehensible or useless. Feeling a waste of money is suitable for giving away. 
0	When Benben first started, the fan sound was a bit loud, but then it stopped. I don’t know why 
1	I just got it today, so I can only talk about it. The first feeling is that the configuration is good, and the price is good. The second book is pretty, I also like the Bluetooth module. 
1	"This is a beautifully bound book of very good quality. The 64 examples in the book interpret the ""beauty of programming"" from different aspects, the fun of games, the charm of numbers, the fun of numbers, and the beauty of structure. Among these four parts, what impresses me most is the fun of games. But programming, this book is always looking for better algorithms, higher efficiency, and better time and space performance. The author will ask, what is the easiest and easiest way to think of, is there a better way? "
0	The promised delivery on the second day cannot be achieved at all. I have been waiting for 2 days, and I asked the customer service to talk perfunctorily before contacting me. No one has contacted me yet 
1	The book is a good book, but the cover is not too gentle, which makes people feel very scary. I am afraid that it will be a nightmare if I put it on my pillow at night. And the worst thing is the preface written by Ji Lao, which is purely bludgeoning, making up the number of words, and having nothing to say. Hey, celebrities have capital for nonsense. When I was in high school, I read Montaigne's selected articles. At that time, I was too young to understand. Now I’m like a baby, I can’t let go of it. Time is a wonderful weapon. When people grow up and have a little experience, they start to pursue inner freedom, start to search for the heart, and start to understand the wisdom of life... So also start Take Montaigne's essays as a treasure. 
0	I thought it was about writing some answers to my inner problems, but who knew it was just a story about feelings. I really feel deceived, deceived by the author. 
0	Very ordinary hotel, the most overwhelming thing is that the breakfast is actually on the ground floor, and there is basically nothing to eat! The location of the hotel is also very average, and the surrounding scenery is very bad! 
1	My husband often drove to do business in the Pearl River Delta area, but the road shape in the Pearl River Delta region is very complicated and often gets lost. I ordered an atlas for him. After careful selection, I selected the new impression of the Pearl River Delta atlas. It was originally planned to be ordered in December last year, but it was out of stock on the Internet. Last time I checked it on the Internet, it was in stock. I ordered it and my husband saw it. I was very pleasantly surprised. I liked it very much. After I came back from get off work every day, I watched the map there to see what the road he traveled today, so that he can quickly become familiar with the route of the Pearl River Delta. , Conducive to their work. 
1	The price-performance ratio is high. I came back from Leshan after staying for one night and renewed it for two nights. 
1	The hotel service is good, and the environment is also better! Especially it seems that the revolving restaurant on the 48th floor is full of characteristics, at least I feel satisfied with staying in this hotel! 
0	I didn't want to comment, but for the sake of Ctrip's fans, let's talk about it. 
0	There is no driver, which is a little inconvenient, but you can download it on the official website, and it doesn't matter much. The most depressing thing is the pre-installed freedos system, which I can’t understand. I took it back and found that I couldn't do the system. I took it to the HP repair center and was told that there was a problem with the factory settings. I modified it before fixing it. Unhappy running on a hot day. 
1	The business machine should be stable and the sound is lighter (the details will be tested in future use). Lenovo's after-sales service is very good, and the telephone customer service is very patient and thoughtful. 
1	Absolutely located in the center of the city, opposite the lilac lotus, next door is the Wang Yipin main store that sells the best Hupen. 5 minutes walk is the most lively Hongqi Road, the deluxe double room is reserved, because 
0	A bit heavy. The TAB button was loose when I got my hand at first, but it was okay to press it back once I pressed it. There is a problem with the wired network connection, but it may be a problem with my home network. 
0	The hotel facilities are old and the service attitude is poor. The air conditioner is not turned on on such a hot day. You can always say that you are at a discounted rate. It is wise not to enjoy the air conditioning. In fact, the whole building is reluctant to turn on the air conditioning because of the low occupancy rate. It will not be open. It has not reached the 4-star service standard at all, let alone the sense of service. Remind everyone not to read the previous reviews, it is probably written by their own people. Because the meal fee of 360 does not include breakfast, the front desk It was said that if we pay 360 cash, we can get a discount of 10 yuan for breakfast. Imagine this is a regular hotel? The room invoice is issued and then I remember that there is no rounds, who is happy to wait for them to rounds, and naturally left, I knew , How can you bring something with you? Feedback from the hotel July 28, 2008: Dear guests, first of all, we thank you for choosing to stay in this hotel and provide valuable comments. We sincerely apologize for your unpleasant feelings during your stay in the store. The hotel attaches great importance to your feelings and has held a departmental special meeting. At the same time, we will strengthen the training of employees and better improve the quality of service. I hope you can visit our hotel again. If you encounter any problems during your stay in the hotel, please contact the relevant department. We will solve it successfully for you. Thank you. Regarding the internal self-review of the hotel you mentioned, this hotel will make a special statement: the hotel cannot log on to the review platform of Ctrip. Only the guest can enter the platform after booking through Ctrip and successfully check in, so we cannot review on our own. We once again sincerely apologize for your unpleasant experience during your stay in the store. 
1	it is good. . . The comb in the room is very good and I have been using it at home now. . You have to check in next time and take the free comb home. . Hahahahaha. . . The location is not good, it is quiet, and it is better to call a taxi, but there are basically no restaurants around, and I had a bowl of tomato and egg noodles in the restaurant on the first floor. . . not bad. . 
0	The book was crumpled and crumpled when it was given to me, so ugly! Hope you can improve the quality of service! Who is happy to look like this! 
0	"I checked into this hotel in the early morning of March 27th. As a three-star hotel, there was no hot water, but the front desk clerk knew it but didn't tell me in advance when I checked in! When I was preparing to take a bath, I found that there was no hot water. I called the front desk. The phone turned out to be broken, and the waiter on the floor was nowhere to be seen. I had to wear disposable slippers to the front desk on the first floor to question. The waiter said with an extremely bad attitude: "" No hot water means no hot water. You can check out if you don’t stay.” I repeatedly explained that I only have two hours of rest, and I have to catch a plane in two hours. She remained indifferent, as if it had nothing to do with her. I had no choice but to tell her to show her written proof that the hotel had no hot water. She never gave it and was deadlocked for a long time. At this moment, I found a big guy standing behind me. When he turned around, it was the security guard. He said fiercely, ""You What attitude?!"" This is strange to me, I am a guest, what attitude can I have? My basic requirements for bathing were not met, and I was driven away coldly. At this time, where did I leave the room? When we find the hotel, it will dawn and the plane will take off. Can people live in such a hotel? What's the point of apologizing after hurting the guest? And the room fee is charged according to the rules, and a point is a must! As an old member of Ctrip and a travel planner, I strongly recommend that Ctrip carefully consider its partnership! There are also related tourism departments in Xi’an. I’d like to say one more thing here. Xi’an is an international tourist destination. Xi’an’s service level is really not flattering. It is generally expressed in hotels, taxis, and civil aviation buses. Xi'an is extremely insecure. I often go through Xi'an. The above is my deep experience. It is often the popular service places that truly reflect the quality and service level of a city's citizens. Additional comment on April 5, 2007: In addition, the address description of the hotel is not exact. The hotel is located in the northwest and the railway station is in the northeast. How can it be said that it is adjacent? I remember that I took a taxi from the railway station to there for twelve yuan , It is estimated that it is 5 to 6 kilometers, is it a taxi detour? But from the map, the Northwest Third and the train station where the hotel is located cannot be said to be adjacent to the train station! "
0	The room is relatively clean, the transportation is convenient, and it is very close to the Bund. But the noise outside is too loud and the rest is not good 
1	The price is affordable and the price/performance ratio is better. Perfect screen, good luck. Battery life is also OK, it can last for more than three hours. 
1	The price is a bit expensive compared to other brands, but it is worth it for the golden paint sign of Asus. Like one, the overall quality is good. 
0	"I ordered ""Du Lala's Promotion"" on November 22 and paid through the bank. Why hasn't the order arrived for more than two weeks? "
0	1. The speed of small books is average, especially hard disks. 2. The keyboard is relatively soft 3. The touch screen is too sensitive 4. The buttons under the touch screen are too hard 5. The heat is large 
1	The leftover males and females born in the 70s would rather be a jade than a complete mentality, but yearn for marriage, longing for the end of the way home, waiting for their own lamp to be very real social reality, not pretentious, and a clear reflection of the 30 reminders. People's psychology, whether married or unmarried, is the road to marriage. If you have not thought about it, or you have already thought about it, but with many considerations, this book is worthy of your reading. The author’s true writing will not make you feel as if you are reading a novel, but it is more like listening to a friend’s confession, or your own heart is telling you the past you don’t want to be known. 
0	"The content of the book, nothing to say, is very good, but the quality of the paper packaging and cutting of the book is too poor! ! ! ! The paper and packaging of the book I bought from Dangdang before are pretty good. The two copies of ""Seeking a Doctor is worse than Seeking Yourself"" I received this time have very rough edges, rough paper, and uneven cutting. Because of this problem, the return is not good, but I feel very uncomfortable when I read it in my hand! Hope that the quality will be strictly controlled in the future! ! ! "
1	Just checked in and like the mountain view room. Especially the walking route map provided by the hotel is very enjoyable. Since you are staying in Building 5, which is a bit far from the hot springs, just in time for the light rain, it is recommended to provide a scooter. Hotel feedback April 14, 2008: Dear guest, hello! Our hotel has an in-house transportation vehicle that can take you to the hot spring club for free. It is recommended that you walk to the hot spring club and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hongzhu Lake along the way. 
1	The classic HP looks good, and the configuration is quite good at this price. The 45NM CPU plus the unique display 
1	I like the appearance better. The LED screen is cool. 16:9 is the future trend. It is not lighter than my friend's ASUS. Of course, the most important is the GT130m ddr3 graphics card. NBA2k9 Need 12 Colin McRae Rally is easy to solve! After comparing with my friend T5800, the performance of T4200 is slightly more than a little bit. 45nm is very good and the overall performance is strong! Haha 
0	My son is 39 months old. Although he doesn't understand this book well, he has initially shown interest in this book. Said to learn from Carmela and use it to overcome difficulties continuously! I hope Dangdang will sell interesting and educational children's books! 
1	[Recommended Books] It’s not an exaggeration to have one book, that is, you need to read a good book. 
0	The hotel is too old, 2-3 star standard! ! ! ! ! No sense of security! 
1	Although I have been in college for four years, I am still not proficient in accounting. The book you wrote made me fall in love with accounting. From the beginning to the feeling of accounting, in fact, accounting is like this, it is not difficult at all! So I am very grateful to you Sunshine and Sunshine Mom, this is what it should be! The problem is still there, and it is sent to the mailbox again, I hope to reply! Thanks in advance! 
1	Cheap, cheap is not good. Alas, the chip is too bad, it does not dissipate heat, and there is noisy noise in less than a few minutes after booting. Only 3 USB 
1	The rooms and services are ok. There is a large parking lot behind, which is very convenient for motorists; for travelers, taxis may be often used. 
0	"Chengde’s history and natural scenery are beautiful, but in terms of hotel services, I don’t dare to compliment the accommodation: 1. The standard room facilities in the room are simple but clean, but the room always has a pungent smell of furniture; in addition, the wooden door of the room is deformed every time The door is always closed with hard work, not only the sound is loud and disturbing, but also it is not easy to lock. 2. The furniture is obviously aging, and many of the furniture are painted off. 3. The environment is very quiet, suitable for accommodation, without sloppy harassment, and can sleep well. Dining: I have eaten a few vegetarian restaurants in Beijing, and I think this should be good too. ! ! Hey,,, First of all, there are 2 pages of vegetarian dishes on the menu. The dishes are monotonous, and they are mixed with meat dishes, which is disappointing. But now that it’s here, how can I order a few vegetarian dishes to try? By the way, I ordered a bottle of fine local beer for 15 yuan. I didn’t expect one of the vegetarian dishes ""sweet and sour pork loin"" after the dishes came. Chef The sugar was too much and it became bitter. My wife and I couldn't eat it, so we hoped to return or change dishes. Unexpectedly, the trouble was coming: First, the waiter took the food back, and then the kitchen returned the food as it was. There was no way to ask the foreman to discuss it. After a while, another waiter came over coldly and asked us why we are looking for the foreman. I had no choice but to explain it again; wait and wait, after all the calls, the foreman finally showed up and asked what was the problem, I repeated it again. The foreman took a bite with a serious expression and categorically asserted: ""The food is okay, this is what we taste like!!!"" Silently, I only had to settle the bill obediently, and took the angry wife back to the room. This is the service of a 4-star hotel. I can only say in my heart: ""The customer is God, I will never stay here next time."" "
0	There is only a partition of c and a hidden partition of 10g, hey, but this is the case now, the hard disk must be replaced with a larger one 
0	I bought a set for my daughter last year. I feel that both the content and the printing quality are very good. I ordered a set for my friend's child a few days ago, and it was disappointing after receiving it! I feel that the printing quality is much worse, the colors are not bright, the picture is not clear, and the mood is heavy! 
0	There are only 2 USB ports, and Jingdong's parameters say 3, depressed, the screen is not used to it. No package, no mouse, no system disk, stingy. 
0	The battery is very poor, it can only be used for one and a half hours, the memory still needs to be added, the camera is very bad, and the wireless network card driver has been searched for a long time. 
0	The printing of the book does not look good, the picture is not beautiful, and the content is not even good, so it looks like it can't attract the children's interest and eyeballs at all, but it really doesn't want to sleep and read it, which is hypnotic. For instance, I don't like to talk about these books. 
0	The keyboard is also piano lacquer, not used to it, and the hand feel is average. ASUS's own software conflicts with VISTA, and several function keys feel bad. 
0	The service is terrible! Checked in on July 9th, at the 11th store in the evening, call the 1168 switchboard and ask for a wake-up service at 645 the next morning, room number: 2319 (for query and confirmation). I didn't do it!! This is the first time I encountered a long-term business traveler, because there was a meeting at 830 in the morning on the 10th and I stayed at the hotel one day in advance. Fortunately, the bed in this hotel is too hard to sleep well. saved me. Hereby evaluate. 
0	Acer dare to make an integrated driver package? There are some minor problems with installing drivers under xp, especially touchpads. Some drivers still conflict with the mouse 
1	"Be sure to follow the method in the book to do the exercises. I tried it for 3 days now and I feel much better. It seems that some of the symptoms have worsened during some of these three days, but I believe that if I choose the method in this book and stick to it, I will definitely get out of OCD. Another book I read now is ""Who Is Forcing My Life"". The author is Meng Gang and the publishing house is Huazhong University of Science and Technology Press. "
1	Very quiet and good surroundings. The traffic is more convenient. However, there are not many entertainment facilities or eating places around. 
1	The workmanship is OK. I have my own USB optical drive, which is very convenient to install the system. It comes with XP drive CD 
0	The heat is large, especially when the vista system is upgraded, the bottom is a bit hot. The broadband is larger than the average 12-inch laptop, and it feels like 13.3. 
0	2. Why does the order have to wait for the goods to be reviewed before it can be paid? I have to wait forever. I just can’t pay directly online. 3. If the telephone service is always waiting for people, please increase the number of services 
0	The trash, the waiter ignores it. The room is dilapidated and has a peculiar smell. The hotel has at least 20 years of history. Has the information been opened two years? 
1	Added a piece of memory, no problem to use, installed xp system, installed pro/e 3D graphics, very good and powerful 
0	The room is really bad. I stayed in a superior double room, but there was a smell of paint in the room... The bathroom system in the room was so bad that I couldn't take a good shower. The air conditioner was basically absent... 
0	It's ridiculous. When you check in at this hotel, you have to pay for a bag of pistachios. They can't count the number of their items, and they made a mistake. It is consumers who pay the bill. I would like to ask everyone: do you dare to go to such a place? I chose to resolutely never go again. If I want to rate this hotel, I give it 0 points. The goodwill of their service to customers is completely wiped out by their stupid actions at checkout. Additional comment April 15, 2008: I suggest you Choose other hotels when you arrive in Rizhao, I wish you all a happy stay in Rizhao. 
1	It is very vivid, practical and easy to operate based on the examples that appeared in the baby's growth process, thinking with a rational and wise mind, and explaining with love. Each of our families will encounter similar problems when educating children. Can we be as rational as the author? Education is really a profound thing. For children, every family will love, but not necessarily education. I highly recommend this book, so that every mom and dad can see the advantages of their children, experience their children's mood, be full of love and confidence, and develop our children into adults. 
0	I have bought <<How to say that children will listen, and how to listen to children before they are willing to say>>. I found that many examples in these two books are the same. I am sure that there are many plagiarisms in them. Disappointed!!! 
0	I don’t know why the sound of the CD-ROM drive is so loud when it is turned on, and the vista is installed, it is very slow, very uncomfortable, and there is only one zone, it took a night to switch to XP, and the speed is reasonable. 
1	The price is particularly high. . Back to install XP, install ubuntu are particularly easy to use. . . There is no problem with installing the system. . . 
0	Whether it is a novel or a workplace textbook, the writing is wonderful; whether it is a foreign company, a state-owned enterprise, or a civil servant, it is worth learning and referencing; men can also read it, and there will be gains 
1	Small and exquisite, suitable for certain occasions. As for netizens, it is easy to leave fingerprints, it is true, but just wipe it. The price of 2990 is really low, and the price is good. As for the weight, it's ok, the key is that the battery is heavy. 
1	I bought it for my dad because the screen is big enough. You need to install the system yourself. The XP driver was downloaded from the website, and it took a while. For Dad, Dad is quite satisfied. The home is very good and the performance is sufficient. The appearance is moderate, and it does have a clear plastic feel. But Dad pays more attention to performance and use. recommend. 
0	I feel very dissatisfied with this hotel. The service, facilities and location of the hotel are very, very poor. The special hardware facilities are either broken water pipes or TV. The water pipe exploded in the middle of the night, and I did not sleep peacefully during the few nights I stayed. I complained that the Korean guests on the same floor were too noisy. When complaining about the noise, the unprofessional operator asked me to check which room it was in the middle of the night. The guest of, it is Mo Mingqi second, do not know where the professionalism of the service staff in Hong Kong went. . . . Mo Ming. . . . The location of the hotel is also very unsatisfactory. If you want to save time, you need to take a taxi to the subway station. If you buy too many things, I believe it is really a painful thing for me to return to the hotel. . . . . . 
1	The appearance is beautiful and it is also very good to use. I originally installed the XP system, but I didn't recognize it. So I called for on-site service and spent 68 yuan. I reinstalled the Vista system and one-key recovery. After all, it is 2G, and the genuine system is very cool. The color and clarity are satisfied! ! 
1	"This little book, although the text is short, but the content of ideas is really great. In fact, at first I didn’t know why Chang Naide hired people. Later, I read his book by accident. I couldn’t put it down and bought a copy immediately. This book needs to be read slowly. Some words cannot be understood right away. After understanding the context of the development of Chinese thought, this book is very inspiring. There are many wonderful points in the discussion of Chinese thought, and I will not point out them here. I feel that I can read it with Ge Zhaoguang's ""History of Chinese Thought"". "
1	After I owned this book, I benefited a lot, so I bought this book for my parents. Now they are like a treasure. They have made a solid round ointment according to the book by themselves, and I insisted on taking angelica powder for a while After that, I feel energetic and sleep better, which is really good.Seeing my parents are getting better, I am also very happy as a junior. 
0	The law of fairness seems to mean that we must be fair at all times, otherwise we will suffer retribution! But in the end, I didn't figure out what fairness is. The book tells a lot of the personal experience of the author, and it feels like I am writing about how awesome I am, and it doesn't mean much! 
0	Why is the product description as Core Duo, but when I got it, I found it was Centrino? Call the customer service, and the one who answers the phone will only play dumb, which is very annoying! ! ! No one handles my complaint... 
1	Good quality and stylish appearance! The configuration is reasonable and there is basically no bottleneck. The LED screen display effect is good. 13 inch size is right, easy to carry 
1	"1. This book gives a comprehensive and systematic introduction and evaluation of Wang Shouren's thoughts. 2. Pointed out the progressive side and limitations of Shouren 3. Criticizing Shouren for later generations also gave a comprehensive introduction and analysis 4. Mingyue had some deviations in Wang Shouren's thinking at that time, Wang Shouren also talked about ""destroying people's desires"" and must study in detail 5. No matter how later generations evaluate Wang Shouren, they cannot conceal the brilliance of a generation. 6. As for the criticism of Shouren, as a scholar, he would be delighted if he had knowledge in the ground. "
1	This book should have been read when I was a teenager. If I read this book then, I might change my view of history and affect my future direction. When we were adolescents, most of what we received were orthodox historical textbooks, too many dogmas, too many contrasts between advancement and limitations, and too many summaries of class struggles. The real history is the entry point of the author's observation. An ordinary person or an ordinary thing has changed or created the direction of history. In fact, why not our own life... 
1	In fact, I bought this book for myself, because MY BABY is only one year old and seven months old, how can I read it? But I found that she likes painting very much. I will only teach her to draw simple objects such as apples and bananas. The other paintings are too complicated and she can't learn them. If the paintings are too simple, they don't look like them. So, I thought of buying a book, I first learn it, and then teach her to paint, to be precise, to show her painting-because she is too young, she can only draw circles! ~~ Understand, it feels very interesting. Looking at the cute patterns on the book, it’s okay to learn for your children! 
1	The appearance is good, the girls are very fashionable! Personally think that this kind of performance, this kind of screen, this kind of price, it is the best! It is perfect with a Pennefather wireless laptop mouse! Although it is made of plastic material, it is the right price. You can't get a magnesium alloy at this price! Too unrealistic! With HD support, it is more than enough to put the TV output in the living room at home as HTPC! Absolute value! The Core Duo is a bright spot. Although the heat is a bit big, the overall control is pretty good! There is an all-in-one card reader, which is convenient for people with digital products! There is a camera, there is a built-in microphone! The accessories and instructions are comprehensive! 
0	The hardware facilities are too old, not in line with the price, and the price is still expensive. Additional review July 29, 2008: The bed in the double room is too small, and two people feel uncomfortable sleeping 
0	Outdated facilities, breakfast is not too rich, it can only be said to be average 
1	I originally booked this place because it was considered cheaper on the mountain, but I found out that it was much better than expected. At least very clean. The sound insulation effect is not very good. The people next door go to watch the sunrise in the morning, it is noisy~~ Other feelings are not bad 
1	Beautiful appearance, the biggest selling point. The keyboard is big, the reason why Lenovo S10 was eliminated. The battery is good. 
1	After reading dozens of pages in the past two days, many languages have begun to make people look up. I don’t know how the original version is expressed, but the translation is really lame. I checked the original work online, but couldn't find it. I had to read this edition first. After reading it, make further comments. 
0	I bought it for a friend, ￥6999, compared to A34’s promotion of ￥6199, the price is lower, not even a VISTA, driver CD. The machine is heavier than expected. 
0	The whole article is superficial and tacky little examples, and elementary school students can write these! Comparing Yu Dan with Yi Zhongtian, it simply ruined Professor Yi! Do not buy this book, I regret it for a lifetime! I read it again and treat it as Waste paper is sold! It is too low level, junior high school students will look down on it! 
0	1. The outer surface of the piano lacquer is the fingerprint collector, which is horrible if you move your hand twice; 2. The lenove label on the outer surface is not beautiful, and the Thinkpad i can still be bright at a point, which is a bit of a spoof for business books; 3. The display The display is a bit pale and the color is a bit distorted. 
1	No problem for now. It is best to divide the partition with diskgen, and then rebuild the MBR. If you delete the partition directly, a grub prompt will appear. This linux is really bad... 
0	The content is empty, the language is grandiose, the whole book is not systematic, just like a bad doctor practicing medicine. This is the worst book I bought from Dangdang. 
1	I think this is the hotel I have the best service at Homeinn.. The transportation is convenient, but it is not easy to book the room. Friends who want to stay should book a few days in advance. 
1	The keyboard area is larger--easy to use. The useless touchpad has been reduced---good. The sound quality is good, and the screen is super bright. The burning speed is fast. The heat is not large. The Toshiba software is good. 
1	In fact, when dawn comes, the story begins to become funny. If Bella tried her best to give birth to Nice, it’s just that Mel wanted to arrange his brand for Jacob, and then Jacob’s feelings for Bella became vague and void, I would hope that Mel arranged Jacob for Bella. Love is painful for a lifetime. So, who can be sure of whose love? If Jacob had loved Bella so much, how could it be that after seeing Nice? I think it's because Mel is so kind, she let everyone get what they want. This story really shouldn't be written down anymore, it's better to leave some suspense. 
0	The power supply is too hot. The roommate’s L3000-G430A PSE power supply can be used to freeze popsicles. Do I need to bake sweet potatoes. Also, I don’t know why the barcode on the computer case is cut off with a knife. I am very dissatisfied. 
1	The graphics card is good, and although the CPU model looks relatively low, the performance is not much worse than the high-end. Very cost-effective. At present, the heat dissipation is good. The game performance is very good. 
0	I can only say that the content is not what I want, it should not be suitable for me, I don’t like it very much, I just read a few pages and put it aside 
0	It is a little troublesome to install XP system, but fortunately, Dell's after-sales service is quite good, so I can answer them patiently. 
0	There is a camera without a microphone! The touchpad is not easy to use, and it generates a lot of heat! (The hard drive is under the touchpad) The fan noise is a bit loud! 
0	Yu Dan’s experience, I have watched it on TV and on the Internet. I remember that the teacher showed it to us when I was in college. Now I read a book, so I bought one, and I read it and it feels good, as well as bookmarks. The printing is in color and very good.

1	"Before I went, I booked a luxurious executive single room on Xiecheng. The discount was 380 yuan. The pick-up service there was not bad, and it was quite punctual. The driver also sent me to another place where I was going, instead of going to the hotel to check in. They also helped me make room reservations. I will enter the hotel at 16:00 after I finish the work. After entering the room, I found that the room is very small and there is no 25cm2 as mentioned on the Internet. You can see the photos I posted. The bed is against the wall on one side. Because this did not match the information I booked, I called the front desk to inquire. The front desk actually said that I had ordered a three-star luxury executive single room, and now I was given a five-star standard single room, and said sarcastically, ""If you are concerned about the size A taste of pursuit can help you get it back."" The attitude is very rude. Even if your room rate is the same, you should at least say hello before you change rooms. This is the most basic respect. Besides, their so-called five-star does not meet the five-star standard at all. Not to mention the small room, the bath products only shampoo, there is no bathrobe, there is only a packet of green tea in the tea basket. There are about 5 satellite channels. If you are going to Lianyungang, I suggest you live in the Pearl Marriott. Although it is a little farther from the city, the service and environmental facilities are much better. The waiters are also very kind, in line with their quasi-five-star level of listing. Although Pearl Champs (I haven't lived in) is added, the three Mingzhu belong to the same owner. But it feels really worse. "
1	Considering the location, star rating, price, environment and facilities, this hotel is quite good. If there are no other factors, I will stay again next time. In order to make your hotel a healthy development, I would like to remind you: 1. Not professional enough, no professional smile. 2. The room (1117) has a problem with the faucet and the water. Does anyone report for repair and management? This involves resources, cost, reputation and service. 3. The noise of running water at night when the air is adjusted (the decibel may not be less than 50), it may affect the rest of many guests. I hope that it will be changed next time. 
0	It’s a little hot, the noise control is average, the keyboard is not well made, and it feels shaking. It is troublesome not to send an inner bag. 
1	Delivery is super fast. Orders placed before get off work on Friday will be delivered home on Saturday morning. Like it~~The size is relatively small 
0	I was misled by the comments of Dangdang.com, thinking that this is a good book that would leave regrets if I didn’t buy it or read it. I bought it quickly after I found it. After reading a few pages, I was really deceived. This is like a book about history. The style of ridicule throughout the text, the Internet language, the vernacular, and even many sentences contain language problems, which is really misleading. 
1	"I remember when I first bought it for her, I brought it back with ""My Dad"". When I asked her which book she was listening to, she was going to listen to ""My Mom"", and when she was finished telling her ""My Dad"", she said ""Tell ""My Mother"", I heard it four times on the first day. When I talk to her, I will add some content that can be connected with life, so that she is more willing to listen. In the end, when the child loves her mother and the mother loves the child, I will tell her ""just like a mother loves you"", and then The baby will say ""Mom, I love you"". After listening to it, my heart is very sweet. "
1	I have been there once, and this time I booked a room from Ctrip, but it seems that the communication with the front desk is not good, and we can't find our name when we arrive, which is strange 
0	The camera is very unclear, it is much worse than the camera I bought for 45 yuan, and the memory is easier to compare. The battery is not enough for 3 cells 
1	"I have been through ""Lectures on Ancient Chinese Culture"" by Mr. Ge before, and I feel that the overall feeling of this book still reveals Mr. Ge's unique insights. After reading it, he has a certain understanding of some classics. But it feels relatively shallow, and the length is relatively short. A lot of the content seems to end at the beginning. Without in-depth and thorough explanation, it feels like the ""Guide to Masterpieces"" on the market. Some of the words are similar to ""Lectures on Ancient Chinese Culture"", and part of the content of ""Lectures on Ancient Chinese Culture"" is a little deeper and more thorough. I personally hope that Mr. Ge can go deeper and better. "
0	Installing the driver is too cumbersome. Although there is a website download, there are always prompts for the specific driver installation sequence, which ones must be installed and which ones are optional. 
1	This set of textbooks continues the new concept of English with pictures and texts. In order to adapt to the reading characteristics of children, the illustrations in the book are colorful, lively and cute (although the illustrations are very rough). The content also chooses the scene dialogues commonly used in life, which is very practical and kind. What makes me most satisfied is that the book is equipped with mp3 and dvd discs, which are suitable for the trend of modern media. Unlike some textbooks that are still only equipped with audio tapes (where can I find a tape recorder?). The holidays are coming, I plan to take my son to study hard! 
0	The environment and various facilities are very old, the rooms are small, the subordinates are too small, and the service attitude is average. It's not even 3 stars 
1	Near the railway station, the location is convenient and moderate. To comment on the standard and price of a three-star hotel, in all fairness, it is really good, and it is a good recommendation for Ctrip. Thank you. The lobby is not luxurious, but spacious and comfortable. After sitting for a long time, the waiter offers hot tea. The garden parking lot, from the guest room, the view space is not cramped, and it is properly greened. Free Internet access is provided, and occasionally there is a problem, the waiters are quick and polite to assist, and the attitude is friendly and gentle, which is worthy of praise. The guest rooms are equipped with adequate facilities, sanitary and clean, and are a reliable and good service organization. Those who come to Dali but do not insist on living in the ancient city, please consider. Additional comments October 22, 2007: I agree that some netizens have recommended restaurant service as good, but the dishes are not attractive. 
1	If I were you, I would still choose a life like you now. It doesn’t matter how many difficult moments there are, but I use warm words to describe the past life. It’s like Australia’s oceans and sunshine are beautiful and brilliant, with the company of Anthony Mosquito. It’s difficult. I have two books and one of my own for a boyfriend who is far away in Japan. I hope he will look at Anthony's words when he is disappointed and sad. There are many children like them in this world. Anthony is with me. You live together i know what you want to express 
1	High cost performance. Service attitude is also okay. The room is small. What's more commendable is that there are no harassing calls at night in the hotel near the train station! commendable! The breakfast is relatively simple, in general. 
0	Very remote, road construction outside, very messy, rooms are ok, service is average 
1	The room is too small, and the room I booked with the GreenTree Inn membership card is better than the room booked by Ctrip. It is the last room on the fifth floor, it seems to be 522, the room is very big, and the bed is also oversized. It’s much larger than the 1.8 meter. I hope Ctrip can provide such a room 
0	Pros: There is an elevator (the Kaifeng Hotel on the 4th floor does not even have an elevator), and there seems to be no phone harassment at night (Kaifeng Hotel harassed and finally chatted with the massage lady on the phone) Disadvantages; the room is like a guest house, the equipment is aging, can it be counted as 3 stars? The price is high, the price is not good! The door is noisy and it feels bad! 
0	When booking the room, it said that free late check-out until 16:00. However, it is completely impossible.. Late check-out will be charged for half a day. 
0	Check in around 9pm on the 6th, and there are two other pairs who checked in at the front desk at the same time. As a result, they were all told to show the marriage certificate. If there is no marriage certificate, the addresses on the ID cards of the two people must be the same. If the ID addresses are not the same without the certificate, it is impossible for two people to move into the same room. All six people on the spot were dumbfounded. In any case, there is no habit of bringing a marriage certificate when I go out and I never asked for a marriage certificate when I made a reservation. The waiter at the front desk just didn't let go. Later, a GG went around several times to find a local acquaintance, and then called the waiter to make sure that if the police came to check the room in the middle of the night, they took all their responsibilities before they started to handle it for us. It took me to 10 o’clock to live in the big bed room with sea view in the corner of the 4th floor, but the toilet was broken. The waiter came to fix it for a long time and didn’t fix it. He said that he had to call a maintenance staff, and we were so scared that we had to forget it. , I took a long-distance bus this night, who has the energy to deal with maintenance personnel. Set up, go downstairs, there is a tidal timetable in the lobby, which works. Go around to the end of the restaurant next to it and go down to the beach. At night, the sea was windy and the sea was cold, and I felt cold when I wore a jacket. The thought of swimming tomorrow was also blown away. At the back door of the next Holiday Inn, I found a hotel that was still open. The chef and the people in the store were sitting at the door playing mahjong. We went and ordered the spicy fried clams (15/jin), steamed conch (25/jin, exactly 6), pipi shrimp (also called pipa shrimp, 15/jin), peanuts, preserved eggs, and later added A scallion popped sea cucumber, a bottle of Qingdao Pure Raw, what you eat is a delicious one, and it's only 123 yuan in the end. Highly recommend this hotel, because it turns out that this is the cheapest and good-quality seafood we ate during our trip, and it was on the beach at the back door of the 5-star holiday hotel! I was speechless all night, except that the door on the balcony was always closed tightly. We had to hold the single chair against the balcony door to prevent the travel companion next door from sleepwalking over the wall, ha ha. But when I woke up in the morning, the door was still open. . . . Fortunately, at 7 o'clock, I was awakened by the bright noise of throwing steel bars outside. When I checked in, I was told that the hotel is undergoing renovation, which may have an impact. At that time, I thought it was just the interior decoration, and it would not be done in the early morning when the guests were resting. Unexpectedly, decoration means building a building just outside our balcony! And the workers don't care if you are sleeping or not, and you start working at dawn. So I got up very depressed, and comforted myself as a wake-up service. Anyway, the sea you can see from the balcony is okay, and you can whisper to the traveler who lives next to you from the side, ha ha. When the night is quiet, you can hear the rustling of the waves and the sound of the TV next door. In terms of service, class, facilities, and level, this hotel is not worth the 365/night price on ctrip. 
0	There is no heating in the middle of the night, how can I live????!!!!!!!!!! 
0	Bad bad bad, too bad! It is not so bad, I hope Ctrip will not recommend such hotels to me in the future! ! ! 
0	"It was because my son liked cars and the book received rave reviews, so I decided to buy it. But after buying it for a month, he only read it once, and he refused to read it again. I thought this set of books was bought for nothing, but recently my son suddenly became fascinated by it. He has to read it two or three times a day. Before going to bed at noon and before going to bed at night, I have to read it for a while, and it has become a compulsory course. . Of course, the favorite to watch is ""Lun Lun Lun Zhuan"", he is no longer satisfied with my narration. While watching it, he pointed at the ground with his little finger, while saying ""crash"", ""wheel broken"", big mouth rubbish. Car?...Wait, that little appearance is serious. This set of books has become our family's book treasure. I only rated it with two stars last time, and there is no way to change it. I have to give it a big five-star here! In addition, I personally suggest this: For families with young boys, they can buy it for children over 2 years old, especially for boys who like cars, just buy it. "
0	The surrounding environment and internal facilities of the hotel are generally good. But the service attitude is extremely bad, and it is almost defiant. When I checked in, I was filling out my check-in form. Suddenly, a few people in brighter clothes came over and put my ID card and credit card aside to help those people deal with it. After that, two more people came over, and then they dealt with them. After waiting for 20 minutes, I couldn't help but ask if I should do it. When checking out, I encountered the same situation. I was checking out, and when I saw a few foreigners coming, I jumped in and went through the process. I couldn't bear it, so I asked the waiter why, why did I answer you in a hurry? 
0	White seems to be intolerant to dirt, but I am delighted that this special shell material is very special, and it will be wiped off when it is dirty. It is very clean, which is beyond my expectation! ! ! 
1	"It supports XP perfectly. I didn’t dare to buy HP and ACER because I was afraid that I could not install XP. This one did not disappoint me. In BIOS, ACHI can choose IDE. All XP drivers can be downloaded by entering the product number on Lenovo website. The price is 4999. It is reasonable, the screen is good, and the heat dissipation is average. After a period of time, the touchpad will get hot. If you need to disable the touchpad for an external mouse, you need to install an old version first, select ""Disable TOUCHPAD when there is a USB pointing device"", and then Only install the new version, install the new version directly, without this option! "
0	The fan sounds louder, and the heat dissipation needs to be improved. The other is that the workmanship needs to be improved, which may be directly related to the technology of domestic manufacturers. 
1	Portable, clean and beautiful; battery life is excellent; ASUS one-key recovery is quite practical and high-quality, especially for netbooks without a built-in optical drive; keyboard design is more reasonable, ASUS floating island keyboard laptops are still relatively few Yes, I hope this is not just an early adopter; a 160GB hard drive is more suitable, and I haven’t tried too much with a 10GB network hard drive, but it is estimated to be good; a 130W camera is sufficient for video input in most cases; XPH SP2 is pre-installed The genuine system is good; the most important point is to buy it before July 1st. There is no green dam installed. It is very good and powerful. 
0	I don’t know whether the breakfast tableware here is disinfected or not. I saw the waiter took the received tableware and washed it by hand on the faucet and put it back on the plate for the guests. It's disgusting to think about it 
1	Just behind Chongsheng Temple, the hotel has a good environment, but the hardware facilities are relatively outdated. The location is close to the scenic spots, but far from the city, I hope the hotel can provide guests with more transportation convenience, such as more shuttles. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, and the view from the window of the sea view room is also beautiful. You can see the trestle bridge and Xiao Qingdao, and the beach is across the sea. The service is very considerate, I like the snacks on the floor. The room settings are also very thoughtful. Although not big, but a good resort hotel. The fly in the ointment is that the soundproofing facilities are not very good, and it is more miserable when you encounter neighbors who are making noise at night. 
1	First of all, I want to comment on the rooms on the 6th floor of Xuanwu Hotel. They are really bad, at most they have a 3-star standard; the rooms on the 8th floor and above are obviously renovated, which is much better; when we checked in, we suddenly asked for 6 There are two rooms, a lobby assistant at the front desk upgraded us to deluxe rooms, which are all above the 12th floor. The rooms are much larger and the service attitude is good; but what makes me very angry is that the hotel does not allow me to take out Going back to the room to eat, it’s really damn good for my wife. After I argued for reasons, someone showed me the hotel’s management regulations. Is it because the hotel’s regulations don’t allow me to eat? They told me to either go out to eat out, eat in the room, and only order in the hotel. How can I accept such an overlord clause? I entangled with some of them who looked like executives in the lobby for more than 10 minutes. They were on the first floor. The restaurant found us a private room for us to eat the food that we brought back from the takeout, and reminded us not to stain the tablecloth. If it weren't for this, I think I still like this hotel. But because of this, I was so disappointed! 
0	It’s really hard for the author to be able to write English like this. Although it’s a bit funny, it’s a pity that I don’t like this style. Moreover, the mixed reading of Chinese and English can remember some vocabulary, but it ruins the reading ability. 
1	The standard big bed room with jacuzzi and sauna is very unique. 400 holidays, free broadband, and single breakfast are also worthwhile. Will stay next time I go to feel the free jacuzzi and sauna again:) 
1	I really like the cover design of this book. It seems to have a sense of mystery and vicissitudes of Tibetan culture. The content seems a bit obscure. The whole book has descriptions of sex, different people, different times, and different places. It is a smart change from this experience. After reading it, you may not understand what the author is going to say. , I still don’t know much about some content, which may have something to do with not understanding Tibetan culture. The book also has some indirect history of the relationship between Tibet and the Central Plains. Perhaps it is this historical relationship that led to the opposition between the Dalai Lama and the government today! In short, complicated! 
0	I ordered this book a month ago, but it is out of stock. I haven't received it yet. I haven't left a message to tell me when I can ship it or return it. I am not very satisfied with your service! ! ! I haven't found a place to ask questions for a long time, so just write it here, and deal with it as soon as possible! ! ! 
1	"I remember a few years ago I was still a silly high school student. An older sister who was in college gave me a copy of ""The 11th Floor of Building B"" by Fujii, so I learned that there was a girl named ""Yuzi"". Since then, I fell in love with Fujii's words. I saw this ""Ten Years of You"" while wandering in Xiamen, so I found it in Dangdang and bought it. After get off work every night, I read carefully on my own tatami mattress. In ten years, Ah Shu has grown a lot. Whether it is Ashu in the workplace or Ashu in love, they are so cute. Can you remember that there was a girl named Yuzi back then. "
0	It may be a little heavier because of the large battery. Fingerprints are easily contaminated. The XP driver must be installed from the CD, which is more troublesome. Fortunately, the relevant driver can be downloaded from the Internet. I don't have a CD-ROM drive. It took a lot of time to reinstall the system with a USB flash drive, but the operation has been stable after reinstallation. 
0	I received the book. Like the friend above, I did not receive the gift that should be attached to the book!!! Indeed, it is a notepad thing, it looks small, the key is the lack of credibility!!! I think of many friends More and more people are switching from Dangdang to the excellent book shopping. Why is this? Dangdang should reflect on it carefully. You can't start bullying customers more and more because of the big development! Hope Dangdang will give me a satisfying Answer!!! 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the speed is very fast, the most important thing is that it is super convenient to carry, and the battery life is very strong! 
0	Let me start with a good one, that is, the facilities are relatively new. Here are the bad things: 1. The location is relatively poor. In an alley, many taxi drivers don't know. Moreover, there is a sign at the entrance of the hutong that motor vehicles are forbidden. If some drivers refuse to drive in, friends with a lot of luggage will be in trouble. 2. The hotel claims to be free broadband, but when I checked in, I said that there were no network cables. I said there were only 19 network cables. I looked for room service and the reception desk many times and couldn’t solve it. Finally, I had to call Ctrip. Ctrip Someone sent the network cable after contacting me. How do you evaluate the hotel's service? Just one word-cheap! By the way, praise Ctrip. 3. When I checked in at the beginning of November, the lowest temperature was 6 degrees. After I entered the room, I felt a bit cold. After turning on the air conditioner, I felt that there was no improvement, so I called room service. They replied that the air conditioner is turned on, but it is only for air supply. If it feels cold, it will be better to turn off the air conditioner. They also said that the hot air conditioner cannot be turned on. The air conditioner must be dispatched by the above. This is the worst service I have ever encountered. Only stayed for one day and felt bad, I will not consider this place again. 
0	I really don't know what I'm doing? ? Hasn't it been commented? Misunderstanding! I just turned a few pages, I don’t know, I want to burn it! The preface is not followed by the words, the gourd and the melon, the superficial content seems to be a running account! There are all my own feelings and imaginations, and the scientific basis is insufficient, which is a waste of RMB! It’s not worth buying. It says, “Eat ginger soup when you feel menstrual is about to come or when your stomach hurts on the first day. Try to put a few slices of ginger soup, the hotter the better, plus a few spoonfuls of brown sugar.” Don’t talk nonsense if you don’t know, it will hurt Human. I think maybe you are right! The result was maimed! Drink brown sugar water to replenish blood. And effectively store body heat. Don't drink brown sugar ginger water during menstruation, it is when you have a cold. It can promote blood circulation, promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis, and accelerate metabolism. If you drink brown sugar ginger water during menstruation, menstrual flow will increase, and in severe cases, it will cause uterine bleeding. Reference: Obstetrics and Gynecology. It turns out that it is. It's laughable to be able to publish books at this level! It's still a health book, maybe it's harmful! Mental loss fee! 
0	The room is very small and the bathroom is not clean. I live in the standard room. The bathtub is so dirty that I dare not stand, and the speed of launching is so slow. However, it is located in Fengtai District, Beijing. The attitude of the waiter is still very good. But compared to Home Inns and Jinjiang Inns, it really doesn't look like a chain, it's just a hotel. 
1	The price is affordable and the appearance is good. The volume of the built-in speakers is louder than normal. My speakers are relatively quiet when connected. 
0	I ordered six books in this order. As a result, Dangdang sent me five wrong books. After Dangdang delivered to my door, I had to pay to open the package. If there is a problem, the person who delivered it at the time doesn’t care. , I only negotiated with Dangdang on the Internet. I received the book in July, and now Dangdang has sent me the wrong book for almost a month. There is no feedback. I don’t know if I was fooled this time. No one gave me feedback anyway, I hope Dangdang can give me an answer! 
0	The attitude of the hotel’s front desk is extremely bad. I booked a double room on the evening of December 14th. Ctrip’s reservation is until 9pm. Due to changes in the itinerary, the arrival time will be postponed because the hotel has a provincial conference that day. The room may be tight, so call the front desk of the hotel before 8 o’clock that night and tell me that I will be late. Please keep the room. The answer from the front desk is yes. I arrived at the hotel at 9:30 that night and the front desk told me that I had booked 9 At o'clock, the room was cancelled and there was no room. I also showed me the Ctrip reservation fax. I said that I had called in advance to inform me that I would be late and I had received your promise. Now the cancellation of the room is considered my responsibility. , After a long quarrel, a lobby manager came and came up with the same nonsense. In the end, he said that I could only give me an extra bed in a big bed room. This hotel is also disappointed to sign an agreement! 
0	The heat is a little bit big! The speed of wireless internet is average! Lots of pre-installed system garbage! 
0	Look at the online comments, oh my son who bought it. But I think it is for such a small child to read when it is clothed. Children are not interested, this book should be suitable for children over 6 years old. And the story is not interesting. 
1	I drove to the hotel by myself. If I stay at this hotel at night, I can’t see the entrance of the hotel. I called the hotel and asked the people in the car to identify it carefully. As a result, it was difficult to drive around many places. When we arrived at the hotel’s entrance, it happened to be rainy that day. Only one security guard ran at the entrance of the hotel. I still couldn’t see the garage entrance at the entrance of the hotel and asked the security to lead the way. So he arranged for a garage worker to lead the way, and the worker took us to the back of the garage. Hearing that we were the guests who were staying and couldn't pay him for parking, he immediately disappeared, so we went back to the hotel to find the elevator for a long time! ! ! This situation may be difficult to reflect in the past, and maybe I don’t feel too much in normal times, but the collection of these few things reflects the weak management of the hotel. The most important thing is that I think it is more important as a hotel with rave reviews. It shouldn't be! Of course, the on-duty manager's timely apology and room upgrades and other compensatory behaviors afterwards also reflected the hotel management's attention to the guests and the sincere attitude of the hotel to make improvements in time! And the next day, I called Ctrip to apologize! I also really feel that it is very difficult for the hotel to have such an attitude! Originally, I didn’t want to comment on this incident, but later I felt that I might as well let everyone see the true quality of the hotel through my objective praise and criticism! Maybe I will consider staying at this hotel next time, but I still hope that the hotel will actively discover the shortcomings in the future, so as not to be so troublesome for the guests who stay at the hotel later and also affect their reputation! 
1	Beautiful and stable is the biggest advantage of this notebook. The system is very easy to install. Find a GHOST XP disk and install it at one time. The official website has a complete driver. After all downloads, it will be uploaded. There is no problem. 
1	The sun rises and sunsets, year after year, we who are used to living a mediocre life may have long forgotten the dreams and small hopes that we once had when we were little. Does growing up mean maturity? Do not. Maybe we have given up simple life and simple thinking when we grow up. Only the big people will consider their own lives so complicated as others' lives. One day, maybe when I want to think about something quietly by myself, open this book and look for the innocence that belongs to us, and look for the self we have forgotten. 
1	The executive room I stayed in is brand new and has a five-star standard *v*. It's a pity that the Chinese restaurant on the roof is closed for renovation. I really like this restaurant. It has authentic Cantonese cuisine. I hope it will resume next time. It seems that the hotel has spent a lot of energy in renovation and updating. 
0	1. The reconciliation at the self-pickup point is too slow. I bought it for a long time and I can’t comment on it. 2. The fan is a bit loud and needs to be controlled by eeectl 3. There is no num lock and caps lock indicator lights! ! ! My login password is always wrong 4. It's a bit heavy. . 
1	What is greed? After reading it, I asked myself, although the description in the book is very exaggerated, it can indeed arouse my examination. Do you have your own hope? No, that is ideal. Whether you are greedy or not depends mainly on what you want, when you want to eat bread and milk for breakfast, but when you want to eat human flesh. Haha, the author is this point of view. I hardly read the back of this book because I don’t want to read it. The first is that it’s unrealistic, but it’s terrifying. In the world described by this author, I feel very cold, so cold, so cold that I can’t see Yourself. 
0	"Haha, after reading this book, I have to regret it, not for the money, but for the time. To be honest, apart from the missing corners of the book, I don’t think this book itself is worth reading. If anyone wants to see it, I can introduce it. Simply put, it is money worship. ""Love is not important, but money is especially important...... Give up your youthful thoughts and your childishness..."" Hehe, some opinions really disagree, including that since you will be very realistic when you are thirty, Then why is it realistic when you are not in your twenties? Oh my god, then I want to say that people of course have different ideas at different ages. It is impossible to have a twenty-year-old person like a sixty-year-old person. The point of view... and the author probably meant this... "
1	I bought a white book for my own use. The appearance is very beautiful, clean, without any blemishes and minor injuries, the power cord and other related parts inside are also in good condition, the boxes are sealed before opening, this is very good by Jingdong, which makes people very relieved! After opening the notebook, the screen is very clear, although the screen is only 8.9, the presentation effect is still very good, and the keyboard messenger is also considered comfortable. Of course, because the notebook itself is not big, it cannot be compared with the big one. The interface on the side is also convenient, and the manufacturer's color design is not bad. Although the notebook is small, it is also equipped with a camera, and the internal settings are considered sufficient. 
0	A hotel like this dare to ask for 298 yuan, which is similar to a fraud. The front desk of the hotel is like a checkout counter in a restaurant. The service attitude is extremely poor, as if the mind is lacking. The bath water is not hot, the room is poorly soundproofed, and the breakfast is not good. If you charge around 180 yuan, you don’t check much. I’m reasonable. This hotel dares to ask for such a price. Does the staff of Ctrip have any actual I have checked whether I can be more responsible for the users, which really makes people reluctant to book a hotel here. 
0	"After reading this book recommended by so many successful women, I wanted to read it when I was in my twenties, and I looked forward to seeing ""a lot of benefit"". It's a pity that when I saw halfway (Kenneng was not halfway there), I jumped and flipped through it. I really didn't have the intention to read each word carefully. Because those so-called examples and what they want to explain are not all the most basic truths and qualities that a normal person should possess? Does a woman in her twenties want someone to teach this? If anyone's answer is ""yes"", then I think that's nothing more than her life. "
0	I’m running the Frozen Throne blue screen, but the heat dissipation is still not good, and the classic old games are still fine. The battery does not say that the standby time is so long 
1	Excellent appearance, light weight, perfect performance. Of course, they are all compared with similar netbooks. Linux is pre-installed, you need to find xp to install it yourself. But the mbr of the linux hard disk is not the same as that of xp, so if you install the system with winpe, please remember to update the mbr of the hard disk after repartitioning with the partition management tool. There is this option in the operation. Otherwise, it will appear: error17 other drivers go to www.hp.com.cn to download. All in all, a very worthwhile machine. 
1	"What a good set of books. My daughter Youyou is 28 months old and likes to listen to me telling stories to her. There are also many story books at home. That night, I took the book home from get off work and Youyou was playing. I took out a copy of ""Tom Lost"" and told her. She was immediately attracted. She stood by the sofa and listened quietly. When I heard Tom When I couldn't find my mother and cried, I saw Youyou's eyes were filled with tears...After that, Youyou rarely read other storybooks, and pestered me to tell her this set of books every day. The pictures are crisp, without losing details, and the content of the story is very suitable for children of this age. "
1	The hotel environment, the rooms are very good, and the service level is professional. Stayed for two days, I feel really good, the self-service barbecue on the second floor makes people feel at home 
1	There is a computer in the room. Although the condition of the room is a bit crude, the environment, service and meals are still very good. If I go to Wuxi next time, I will still choose here. 
1	As a two-star hotel, I booked a suite. The room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was large, with shower room, and the service was in place. The problem was that the waiter’s Mandarin needed to be strengthened 
1	"As a ""bone spirit"", I have to admire the author's portrayal of the three points of wood, which not only accurately depicts our life pictures, but also deeply exposes our inner struggles and difficulties. Indeed, it is a portrayal of contemporary bone spirits! It writes about the competition in the workplace and the reality of employment and being hired. The pen is plain and clear, and it is a good work. Looking at it, I feel that I have gradually penetrated into this story, working hard with you in the workplace, ups and downs in feelings. Tears also moistened the eyes again and again... "
1	I have been paying attention for a long time, the price is very high, the system is installed and the driver runs very smoothly, and the appearance is also quite good 
1	Dijiao-Although it’s not expensive to take a taxi anywhere, it’s too cold to walk in front of the village and behind the shop, but it’s very convenient to eat in the morning, and the rooms are awful~ It seems that it’s post-remodeled and it’s inferior to Beijing’s InterContinental. It's dull and cold~ I arranged a friend in the north-facing house to take a bath first. The result said that the sewer in the shower was blocked. The inside was all disgusting. The floor tiles were also stained and mottled. The matching towels were not complete. Bath towels and bathrobes were all different. There is only one. I would rather add some money to live in another house. I really don’t know how the 5 stars are obtained. 
1	The geographical location is relatively convenient, shopping, traveling and doing business are relatively convenient. The old hotel was newly decorated and modified. The facilities in the room are simple and clean, but the overall building facilities of the hotel are relatively old. 
0	It turned out to be piano lacquer, not matte, a little regret. Because of the battery, I feel a little heavier, no way, and the relationship with the bear's paw 
0	I don't feel good. . . The price/performance ratio is poor. I don’t know if Yinchuan is like this or something! 
1	"A very good book. After I got the book, I read it by myself. The movements of the big rabbit and the little rabbit in the book are very lively and cute. I can't help but laugh when I look at it. Wenwei, the big rabbit kisses the little rabbit softly, whispering in his ear, warm, just like the pictures of my house. The son also liked it very much. Recently, he often learns from a bunny, pulling my ears and saying to me: ""Mom, I want to talk."" Ha ha. When I left in the morning, I kissed my son who was still in bed. He said to me, ""Like a little rabbit."" Joy! "
1	"I tried to buy the whole set of ""Luan"" by myself. I didn't expect the content to be wonderful, but I just saw that the price was acceptable and bought the whole set. I am a fan of Qing history. Although I sometimes like to read related books, I am more moved by the content of this book. Women who are stupid and infatuated are more stupid, so stupid that they have nothing in their eyes, to pursue that kind of love. In the book, the love between the male lead and the female lead is full of enthusiasm, and the male lead’s perseverance makes me see the flaws of modern urban love. This book is worth a look. This book is worth collecting. Everyone should feel the beauty. "
0	Without the driver CD, you need to download the driver and system software yourself to install XP, but the download is very convenient and not a big disadvantage. There is one point, bad luck, this depends on luck; the top cover is made, there is a gap between the screen and the frame, and the LED lights can be seen from the side when the lights are turned off at night, but it is said that high-end products also have this problem. 
1	Hotel location: 4 minutes, average location, close to Wenshu Monastery at the railway station, taxis are relatively easy to call, wait about 5 minutes. Hotel environment: 5 points, very flavorful Furong cultural theme hotel, very distinctive, personally like it, but as a 4-star hotel, the service attitude is a little bit worse. 
0	The operating system might as well be directly distributed to the bare metal, divided into a disc, and finally reinstalled. Acer does not give a disc and reinstalls the special software and it is not found on the website. 
1	"Life is always the most moving. No matter which country you are in, the principle of family affection is the same, playing with, protecting, educating, caring, being confused... the little things are all on the paper. What touched me even more is that this immortal comic was born in the darkest era in Germany. The author was strayed and moved, but the power of love surpassed everything. It buried suffering and kept warm, tender, and gentle emotions forever. save. People are living well now, but they don't seem to be able to take children anymore. ""Parents and children"" have become a commercial variety in the market. "
0	The hotel cannot reach the four-star standard in terms of software or hardware. The color of the unnamed TV is very poor, and the TV program does not have any international satellite TV programs. How to bring foreign guests in. Standard room is 618 yuan. Harbin can find anything better than it. The most intolerable thing is that a total of six people from two departments of our company stayed in a total of six standard rooms, all of which were booked through Ctrip. On the evening of February 5th, there were five people. The three people in the other department cost more than 400 yuan. The two people are 618 yuan. This difference tells us how to submit it to the same foreign boss for signature reimbursement. I can only understand it as slashing people in a black shop. There are many hotels in Harbin, and I will never go to Jingu again to get killed. I hope other customers should be careful, shop around, check different time periods, and be careful not to get cut. 
1	Very nice hotel, the rooms are large and the bathroom design is good, but the drinks equipment in the room is insufficient. I brought some good bottles of red wine from California, but there were no glasses, but the hotel delivered them right away. The services of guest rooms and concierge are very good. Among the five-star hotels in Dalian, the price is reasonable (but still more expensive than the five-star hotel I stayed in Beijing). I have stayed in other five-star hotels in Dalian, and this one is more cost-effective. 
0	I haven’t seen the product yet, and Jingdong’s system is still not perfect enough. I actually deleted the order when I paid at the point of pick-up. I was speechless. 
1	The service is better, it is also close to the seaside, there are many nearby, and there are not many breakfast varieties. 
0	"I originally ordered a standard room of 220 yuan, but later told me that there was only a standard room of 258 yuan. I had no choice but to agree. I thought that in this class of city, a room with an external standard of more than 300 yuan would be good. After the actual check-in, I felt that the price-performance ratio was poor and the facilities were rudimentary, unlike a window that could represent the image of the city. The air conditioner is centrally controlled and cannot be adjusted in the room. There is a peculiar smell just after entering the room. This is the only one I have encountered in the past two years who stayed in a hotel and had to pay another 10 yuan for parking! It may be that we are rare and weird. Advantages: Breakfast is good, meeting the standard of 20 yuan. Additional comments June 8, 2008: It is recommended to change the address to ""Liufeng Road"" so that it is easy to find by car! "
0	It’s not good. I’ll pay for my deposit and pay by card, and pay for the room in cash. The credit card is also charged with me. I called and asked me to go to Xiamen to get cash. 
0	The low-level graphics card does not match other configurations. In addition, it is slow to run the pre-installed VISTA. It really costs you what you pay. Seeing that Xiao Hei runs VISTA with a lower configuration than this. Just changed XP 
0	Without Bluetooth, there is no built-in operating system, the optical drive is noisy, and the boot is slow, and it will restart when installing GHOST. It will take several times to succeed (the disk has no problem), which may be related to the vibration of the optical drive. Fingerprints are easily left on the shell. 
0	1. The painting style is unpleasant, very rough, and the brushwork is not smooth 2. Most of the content is outdated, and the regionality is obvious3. The author is rich in imagination, but too far away from reality4. The price is higher 5. Kids don't like it

0	"In Kashgar, if you book through ctrip, this is one of only two options. Advantages: In the Han area, there is a night market nearby and broadband in the room. Disadvantages: Although it is OK in Kashgar, the conditions are still very poor (yes, I live in the ""VIP Building"" here), I feel that the room is old for 20 years; I can’t swipe the card at all (although they still ask you to use it) Credit card guarantee...); broadband settings are cumbersome, and you need to set a user name and password; breakfast is also poor, and the travel agency set up on the first floor is more expensive than other places. It is recommended that latecomers do not see that there is broadband here or make reservations through ctrip to book this one, which may affect your travel mood. Kashgar has now heard that a four-star hotel has been built, opened by the Southwest Petroleum Administration of Tajikistan. I guess it will be better than this. "
1	The 13.3? notebook is in the golden range, cheaper than the 12.1? price, and the volume and weight can be taken into account, a good choice! The touch area on this keyboard and the machine are integrated as a whole, the appearance is very good, and it is not easy to get dust! Very good notebook! 
0	The heat dissipation is average, from the touchpad to the right palm rest a bit warm, there are only three USB, too few, but the distribution is relatively reasonable 
0	It's still a bit expensive, if only the price of white and black is the same~~~~ it is better to send the film again, the keyboard and mouse or something, it will be happier~~~~ 
0	The quality is too bad, and the design is serious. I got the computer on January 15th, and on June 18th, 5 months. It was repaired 4 times, and 3 hard drives were broken. 
1	The Sheraton Hotel is really good, a standard five-star hotel. Due to work reasons, I often check into the hotel at 22 o'clock in the evening. Sheraton accepts credit card guarantees from customers and reserves rooms. very good! The location of Sheraton is good, just north of Tianfu Square, absolutely downtown. There is a stadium next to it. There are few shopping places around, so you must go to People’s Square or Chunxi Road Shopping Street. If you live in Sheraton, you can walk around the city to see the scenery of Chengdu. If you want to get out of the city easily, then it's better to live in Kempinski on the South Second Ring Road, which is close to the airport expressway. Sheraton is a member of Starwood and can accumulate points. The breakfast is also very delicious. The room environment and equipment are very good. The service was great. I will choose Sheraton in the future. The day before I checked into the Sheraton, I stayed at Jinjiang Hotel. The bureaucracy in Jinjiang Hotel is too serious. Let me list the problems of Jin Jiang Hotel: 1. Credit card guarantee is not accepted. This completely does not meet the five-star standard, let alone international standards. What if a guest checks in at 22:00? 2. Breakfast is over at 9:30. Most restaurants end at 10 o'clock. 3. The attitude of the waiter is poor, like a waiter in a state-owned enterprise. 4. The internet speed is too slow. I really don’t understand: Why doesn’t Jinjiang Hotel accept credit card guarantees. This seriously affects the interests of guests. I suggest you boycott hotels that are irresponsible like Jinjiang Hotel.

I often see wonderful articles about a cat and a bodhi on the Internet, and I am deeply infected by her and become an out-and-out cat fan.

0	The hotel does not have four stars at all, and there are not a few waiters in the whole building, and the waiters are rude and never say hello; the door of the room is not very sealed, and there is a distance of nearly ten centimeters from the ground below, and it is closed at night. The light, the outside light reflected into the room, it was incredibly bright; no one queued up for freshly burned food such as fried eggs or noodles at breakfast, everyone grabbed it, and the waiter did not guide it, and it was chaotic! 
1	1G memory is a bit slower; on the other hand, I feel that there is one less screw. I don't know if it is not available. Vista will not use it. I will replace it with XP tomorrow. 
1	The price of the coroutine is better. Will stay here next time on business trip. The rooms are not bad. 
0	1. The price drops as soon as you buy, which is more depressing! 2. Using credit card installment payment method, the operation is very long, the order placed on the 9th can only be obtained on the 19th. You can pay by credit card first, and then call the bank to request installments, which is faster. 3. Relatively heavy 4. If you choose piano paint, you will be more satisfied 
1	This is an inspirational book that can give us people living and working in the modern fast-paced era. Maybe you will feel boring and spiritual when holding this book at first, but as long as you patiently savor it, Feel the artistic conception between the lines in your heart, and you will get the true meaning of your success in life! I strongly recommend you to study the contents of this book carefully, you will realize the unexpected wealth in your life! 
0	The KTV is on the 25th floor. The room was shaking all night, so I couldn’t rest well. I had to answer the phone line to dial the Internet. This hotel is really bad 
0	Wasting my time. First, the selected subject matter is not practical. Second, the vocabulary should be unprofessional, while the popular ones pretend to be deep. I feel that the current foreign language education in China is just a few foreigners who have become experts in a few packages, which is much worse than the business English textbooks used in college. 
0	Is it because the book is sold on Dangdang.com and the price is increased? Wasn't it 16 yuan? Why did the price of wine suddenly rise? Don't buy it anymore, wait until the price is adjusted! I have already bought this book, the content is very general, 23.8 yuan, not worth it! 
1	"This is a book introduced in the authentic Japanese version! The Japanese who compiled the book, so the example sentences used in the book are very authentic. Every dozens of sentence patterns are divided into one group, and each group has supporting exercises, which is convenient for checking and consolidating knowledge points after learning! I have read many Japanese grammar books on the market, and I feel that this set is the most valuable! In addition, I recommend the ""Japanese Language Proficiency Test Preliminary Question Bank"" series, which is also highly valuable and can be used in conjunction with this book. However, the question bank series is worthy of its name. There are only questions and answers with almost no explanation. For friends who are not solid enough in grammar, choose carefully. "
1	The second time. Due to the lack of basic knowledge of Java, I skipped a few chapters during the reading process. Of course I read more than the first time, and I read it a little deeper. I think there is still a need to read the third time, maybe there is a fourth time... I don’t want to say more, it is a good book, I recommend all Colleagues who want to learn Java well. This time I looked a little bit more carefully, and found that some translations had shortcomings. Of course this does not affect the overall situation. . . Good book, good book, recommendation, recommendation. . . . . . 
1	I occasionally stayed in a special double room, which is the second time I have stayed in this store. I want to praise it, and there have been many improvements. I can see that the hotel is still operating with great care. There are free books in the special double room, Damn, there are 7\8 kinds, and I also put a pillow of tea in the tea garden. My girlfriend likes it very much, it smells good, and there are free discs and DVD rentals, as long as you deposit 200 oceans, there are many blockbusters to choose from The MM service at the main station is very enthusiastic and the people are beautiful. When I checked in, I asked where I could go shopping at night. I immediately introduced Donglin Plaza. The night view is really beautiful. The Carrefour supermarket and Poly Plaza next to it can be SHOPPING to help my girlfriend. I got a skirt, and by the way, I had some supper, hey, this night is good. 
0	I heard that it was good, so I bought it, but my son didn’t like it at all, and I didn’t like it very much, haha 
0	This horrible place is really bad. It’s like a refugee camp. A bunch of old men and women are chatting in the corridor. The air conditioner thinks it’s unearthed cultural relics. It smells like a strong enzyme. The TV is also wired. I can only receive 3 channels, and I can't see the portrait clearly, so I almost fainted that night. I hope you colleagues don’t live there. In addition, I think Ctrip has a problem with the hotel’s hardware evaluation, or is embarrassed with the hotel. 
0	"This book makes people feel very disgusting. I bought it out of my head. Now she started Zhuangzi again, and she was really called ""Confucius is very anxious! Zhuangzi is angry"" I feel very sick! Simply nonsense! Let people comment silently! "
0	Sanitation, service level and service quality can only be described as poor 
1	Stayed in Room 81118 of Building 8, the service staff was very warm and thoughtful, the room was clean and the breakfast was rich. The bathroom was slightly outdated. 
1	There are only two days from order to get the goods. The speed of installing XP is OK. It is not as cumbersome as mentioned above. After installing the driver online, it takes 3 to 4 hours. The speed of the machine is relatively fast. Movies as large as 1G are buffered for 5 seconds from opening to playing, very good! 
1	The appearance is stylish, and the white keyboard is quite cool to use. The configuration of the machine is the highest among brands of the same price. 
1	The appearance is very good, the 250G hard disk is enough, the speed is good, the original operating system is difficult to get started, it is more convenient to change to XP, when installing XP, it is found that the USB port power supply is relatively poor, if it is a high-power USB device The external power supply is relatively stable. 
0	"I bought this book together with the ""Don’t call me English vocabulary book"". After I received it, I can see the heights on the cover. Looking through the content and layout, this book is really too general. I don’t have the desire to read, and I haven’t turned 10 pages yet; some of the content is not very professional and not worth looking at "
1	The executive deluxe room is a bit expensive and the room size is small! The overall service is okay, but the room cleaning staff is not very polite, and sometimes they come in immediately after knocking on the door! Hotel location is good! 
1	Cost-effective, the keyboard is very handy, the battery is strong and wireless is turned on for 6 hours, the XP is installed with an external optical drive, and the driver is installed with the original drive disk. Only the sound card is not installed, and everything is normal after manual download and installation. Common software installed Very fast. Really worth it, ready to buy another one 
0	1. The pre-installed version is VISTA, so it takes a lot of trouble to change the system; 2. The touchpad is not easy to master; 3. 
0	The machine is almost perfect, but there was a big problem with the EMS during this transaction. Obviously, the goods arrived on the 9th, but I couldn’t find my goods. I was detained until the morning on the 10th. The service attitude was too bad and I didn’t dare to look for him. Shipped 
0	The location of the hotel is pretty good, there are many restaurants nearby. Since it is a one-way street car can only park at the back door of the hotel, it is not very convenient to walk to the front desk. The doorman of the hotel is like a fake and will not help guests open the door, let alone help guests carry their luggage. The attitude of the front desk is not good, and is indifferent to guests. The room facilities are average, and the internet speed is not only slow but also often disconnected. 
1	What a lovely book, the pictures are vivid and humorous, even the gay men in our unit like to read it, ha ha. The story is very philosophical and educational for children. Identifying with oneself and identifying with the world is a course that everyone must complete since childhood. But not everyone can, so there is so much pressure and pain. Traditional Chinese educational thoughts have things that suppress themselves and frame their minds. If you read this book, I think adults will be smiling, what a fun story, what a sunny ending. . . 
0	1. Poor heat dissipation. 2. Playing 3D games always uses one card and one card. I have tried both the XP system and the vista system. The graphics card driver has also been replaced a lot, but the problem cannot be solved. 
0	First of all, I bought it after reading your reviews. I admit I was fooled. The book is very thin. The books I used to buy for my children are basically much thicker than this. This one is very small and has no texture. I read 15 books stacked together and the thickness is less than 5 cm. In addition, the binding is very poor. Each book is fixed with a staple. Such a book is very dangerous for children. My little treasure has been cut by such a book before. Children are not so honest in reading, so The books I buy in the future are all without nails. Everyone is optimistic about it. If you want to understand it, buy it again. Don’t read the comments. It’s good. The price is not expensive. I bought it for a long time. I just threw it away. It’s useless. 
0	The book was later bought. The son of two years and five months listened carefully to me before going to bed. For the son who doesn't like books, this book is the right one. It is one of the few books he likes to count. 
0	The car-based drawing format is not suitable for parent-child reading by Chinese girls. My child will be fresh for a while and never want to watch it again! 
0	All aspects are average, like a small hotel, there is nothing too out of defects, the price is slightly expensive. 
0	I like this book very much, but it makes me sad that I feel comfortable and pirated. The print is fake, I don’t know that Dangdang will sell fake books. 
1	Very nice hotel in Dalian, but it almost made a mistake with Nanshan Garden 0.0 
1	"I stayed at the beginning of this month. I also read some reviews before booking, especially the lingering fear of the ""less hot water and slow internet speed"" mentioned in the reviews, but because of its good location and the right price, I ordered this restaurant at the instigation of a friend Hotel. When I first arrived in Dunhuang, I discovered that there is no such thing as convenient location in such a small city. I have not taken a taxi for two days in Dunhuang, and I have been walking. Therefore, it is not very important to say that its geographical conditions are superior. Talk about service. When I checked in at the front desk, I said that I had booked through Ctrip, and the service staff immediately said my name. The first reaction: the service here is really fast; the second reaction: probably very few guests. Under the reminder of the front desk staff, I paid attention to the scrolling screen in the lobby, which actually read: ""Welcome to our shop..."" in large characters, I felt very cordial and immediately felt happy. Entering the room, it feels okay, much better than similar hotels in Jiuzhaigou. And here, like Beijing, there is also digital TV. My friend took a bath in the afternoon and said that the water was very hot and the amount of water was very large. Think: It's probably improved. In the evening, I plan to try my luck on the issue of ""hot water and internet speed"" in the forum. I turned on the faucet at 7:30 and there was no hot water for a long time? ! ! It is said that Dunhuang lacks water, and I am too embarrassed to release the water so aggressively. After 2 minutes, there is no hot water. Give up! I thought: I knew it would be fine to wash this afternoon, regret it. Let’s check the Internet again, I want to log in to my YAHOO mailbox, but I didn’t go in from 7:40 to 11 pm, dizzy~! It seems that the online reviews are very objective. At this time, my friend told me: Now it's hot water. It is a pity that I have gradually fallen asleep. In addition, early, as there are not many people staying in the hotel during the off-season, the restaurant is closed and breakfast will not be provided. But Dunhuang is small and there are small restaurants everywhere, so you don't have to worry about eating. Generally speaking, the service is good, with all smiles. The location is OK, there is a bus to Mogao Grottoes at the door. It would be better if the two bottlenecks of hot water and internet speed could be solved. "
0	Such decoration and facilities are actually a five-star hotel, down! House prices are really outrageous, and any company agreement is only in the early 300s. The location is good in Baotou. It is convenient to eat around. There is a glass hot pot which is delicious and cheap (but the beef and mutton in Baotou are good, and the hot pot may be good). At night, there was a lady who followed to the room. How could it be a mess! 
0	Very doubtful about the evaluation criteria of five-star hotels. Samsung is inferior, very disappointed! 
0	The keyboard panel is also made of piano paint, shiny and beautiful, but it is easy to leave fingerprints; but girls generally like to clean, wash their hands often, it doesn’t matter if you wipe them often, you can also develop a good habit of washing hands frequently, haha 
0	The hotel facilities are incomplete and unclean, which makes customers feel that they are not daring to use it at ease, and the attitude of the service staff is not very good. 
0	"I rated 3 hearts not because of Dangdang service or poor book quality, but because of the content of the book that makes people unable to give high marks. This kind of book is not suitable to be bought for close reading, it can only be read as a magazine. And the author himself is not high-level—whether it is narrative or experience. Let’s talk about the author’s age. I think I’m really embarrassed to write this kind of articles. I don’t discriminate against this age or anything, but think that many times a person’s life should not be too early to make a conclusion. , Maybe when you are 40 years old, you will think that what you think at 30 is wrong~ I’m wondering why you’re on the “ranking version”. And I won't mention the right and wrong of the concept for the time being. Many of the concepts in the author's own book are self-contradictory, and many of the content is just an understanding of something. It is too limited to mention ""people around me"" at every turn. There really shouldn't be such a book to mislead others, and readers don't need to buy such a book to waste time. However, the preface written by others is worthy of consideration, and the overtones and overtones can make people smile~~~~~~ "
0	Stayed in a double bed room on the 12th floor on October 2nd. The room is too small and the soundproofing is poor. No. 3 is replaced by a double room on the 11th floor. The drain pipe in the shower room is clogged and the water is flooded. The engineering staff will handle it in the middle of the night (hard work!). Another breakfast There are a lot of stains on the tablecloths. Fortunately, the bedding is clean enough, otherwise I doubt it is a four-star hotel 
1	We stayed at the hotel during the Spring Festival of 2008. For the price: overall it feels good. But the second time I couldn’t use the key card to open the door, I finally troubled the waiter to open the door. Their service attitude is good, which deserves praise. The bathroom is small Point. If we return to Xiangfan again, Jincheng is still our first choice (of course if they do not increase the price). Finally, I hope they can send double breakfast! Thank you! :) Hotel feedback February 15, 2008: Hello! Thank you for your support to Jincheng Hotel! The customer service department has recorded the problem you reported, and we will improve it in future work, thank you! I wish you a happy Chinese New Year! 
1	Iliad is a genius-level figure, really... I always feel that I should spend a little time in my life to study religion, to see what the wise men of ancient and modern times think about the world and life, what they say, their Thinking and speaking have affected how many people and resonated with them, and started to think and start speaking...Spending a few afternoons to look at these shining wisdom thoughts, it is stronger and stronger than doing nothing to browse the web and go shopping. ! 
1	The appearance is super beautiful, the image is clear, and it is very convenient to cut teeth and teeth. I added a 2G apcer memory, which is super fast! It's okay to disperse me, no? 
1	After reading this book for a long time, I feel that I have made many mistakes before. Be careful in parenting! Later, I changed many of my previous practices, and now I am communicating with my children according to some concepts in the book. gained a lot. I sent a book to my sister far away, hoping that she would have such a book in parenting. Very happy. The book also outlines important content with a pen for easy searching next time. There are training questions in each section at the end of the book, which is very good, see if you really do it, listen to the children. All in all very good. 
0	The room is clean, the bathroom is large, but no facilities. There is only one towel per person, which is still broken. Overall it is not satisfactory. 
1	The guest room and the front desk service are okay, but there is a problem with the cashier. I have a little phone bill. I told her for a long time that I still cannot open it like that. In the end, I opened it all in the name of the room rate for her own convenience but not for me. In addition, the dust in the hallway began to scream at 8 o'clock in the morning, it was very noisy, and it was difficult to wake up later. Sometimes it is troubled by the waiter knocking on the door to clean up. This shouldn't be the service that a four-star hotel should have. Overall, I might choose it next time. 
0	Check in on September 20. In general: disappointment! The room I got at the beginning was filled with a strong smell of smoke. I couldn’t bear it. I asked for a room change. I don’t know if the front desk has any opinions. I changed to a room much smaller than the previous one. Forget it. Go to sleep for one night, thought. But when I lay down on the bed, I found something was wrong. The middle of the mattress was sunken, and I couldn't lie comfortably, and I didn't dare to call another room. I don't know what problems would happen again. I had to sleep on the edge of the mattress all night (there was no recess), but I was afraid of falling out of bed all night! depressed! 
0	The so-called four-star Ctrip, the elevator is small and dirty, from the elevator to the corridor to the room is full of the smell of low-end guesthouses, at 2 in the middle of the night someone who claims to be a waiter (female) knocks on the door, will not stay in this hotel, for Ctrip The recommendation is also doubtful! 
1	The characters are printed very clearly, but there are also many fallacies, the spacing is appropriate, not too dense or too sparse. The paper surface is neat and looks very comfortable. The thick rubber instinct on the back cover can effectively prevent the book from damage, the binding is firm, and it is also convenient to carry. I love Jane Eyre’s English original work. The language is more attractive than words. The confession between the hero and the heroine is exciting. The words are really amazing. The writing is profound and delicate, using a lot of metaphors and psychological descriptions. . 
0	The price is cheap in Guiyang, but the room is too old and big enough, the air-conditioning heater does not turn on during the day, so angry! 
1	As soon as I got it, I read the preface written by Fang Wenshan in order to determine his content and style. The result is still good. It is very interesting to describe the youthful sentiment of the people in their middle school and after entering the school. In fact, I read half of the book, but I definitely mean to continue reading it. Assuming that your high school life is very monotonous, you can also find the feeling you want in the small book. If it is not monotonous, it will enrich the plot of the book. Suggestion: You can take a look after graduating from high school. Students who study should still focus on their studies. 
0	The Linux system is uncomfortable. Even if it is Linux, it is troublesome to install a graphical interface. It is not bad to build a water meter such as ubuntu... 
1	light! If there is no gift, I will not buy it! Jingdong is thoughtful! Never heard the sound of a fan! The design of the keypad light is still very interesting! 
0	Not good, room 319 has a bad smell. The request to change room is full, I went in March. I met a Shanghainese on the road. He said that he also lived in 319 before checking out, which also smelled bad. And this cannot be removed, especially at night, it is very thick. I don't know if it's in the toilet or outside the window. The service is average. There is a green bus to Mogao Grottoes in front of the door, but Dunhuang Hotel also has it. Next time I will stay at Dunhuang Hotel. Never stay in this hotel again, the hot water will take half an hour. 
0	"Everst displays Samsung 140AT01-G01 14"" LCD, 2008 produced no serial number. It is not an LED screen. The viewing angle is too small, and it is not facing right, and it feels grayish, afraid it is a snowflake screen. The gap with the Philips display is obvious. "
0	To be honest, this hotel is ashamed of the four-star sign in the lobby. In addition to the size of the room, the decoration and built-in are quite general, and I am afraid it is not up to Samsung standards. Only some rooms have internet access. Although wifi is very advanced, the signal is very weak. When I took a bath, I found that there was no body soap, and the waiter's work attitude was very sloppy. 
0	Hello! I want to ask what I ordered on December 4th <Don't laugh! I am an English vocabulary book>Why hasn't it arrived yet? Isn't it in stock? Is it so long in delivery? 
1	"The authors of the ""Today"" magazine edited their memories of the past few years together, so that people began to reminisce about the poetic years that passed away. In the late 1970s and the entire 1980s, this is how the country was full of romance and passion. A group of passionate people shuttled between words, swaying deep romance. Today, these people are no longer young, but the passion of that era will remain youthful forever! I was also surprised that a book about ""Today"" could finally be published in the Mainland! Think about the fate of ""The Sinking Temple""... "
0	I arrived at about 6 o'clock in the morning, and said that it was necessary to calculate the room rate for the day. I said no problem, most hotels are like this. On the third day, the train did not leave until 9 o’clock in the evening, so I postponed it for a long time to check out at 6 o’clock, but at 5:40 I called to urge me to come to the ward round, and I said what did you urge before 6 o’clock. Ah, and I arrived at 6 o’clock that morning. It’s just a matter of delaying me for another half an hour or an hour. It’s the same as catching guests. Not going anymore. 
0	Definitely not worthy of the title of 4-star hotel (Ctrip indicated that it is 4 stars) 1. The lobby is too stingy, similar to Hanting Inn. 2. The check-in time is too long, there will always be only one receptionist, while registering, while unscrupulously answering the phone, he is in a hurry to ignore how many people are in line. 3. There is no shortcut key on the guest room phone, which is too troublesome to use, so you have to find the extension number. 4. The shower in the bathroom cannot be adjusted in direction, and it is actually facing the door. 5. Last time IT told you that you can't use VPN. Is there any mistake? Many big companies use VPN to receive mail and work! 6. I wanted to book a train ticket back to Shanghai, but I was told that only air tickets can be booked, not train tickets. That's unreasonable! How can a four-star hotel not be able to book train tickets, no way, you can only call the train station by yourself. 
1	The battery can basically be used for more than 6 hours after watching things online and operating continuously, which is quite satisfactory. Handprints are not easy to leave on the surface, which is better than black. Go to ASUS official website to download, all XP drivers are installed well. 
0	The hotel service is extremely poor (state-owned unit). I just came back last week. I originally wanted to go rafting in Song Village, but I was completely mistaken by the irresponsible waiter (Ms. Fang Fei; Ye Junjian, this guy didn't dare to tell me his name, it's not a master!), and there was no guilt or correction. the meaning of. While we are arguing, Ye Junjian's servant is still going to be savage and beating people. This is the current state of state-owned units! I suggest that if you really have no other choice, don't come here, come one, regret one! I'm a lesson from the past! In addition, the traffic here is extremely inconvenient. You need to book a taxi at the front desk when you go out, at least 15 yuan, which is much more expensive than the 2 yuan per person in the city! Hotel Feedback August 7, 2008: We once again apologize to you for what you encountered in this hotel. At that time, our staff apologized to you very sincerely because of the wrong information given to you by Songcun Drifting, and gave you reasonable compensation for losing your precious time, and you also accepted our staff. In addition, the drifting arranged for you does not mean that you have no guilt or correction, nor does it mean that you want to beat people. But no matter what, because our staff's mistakes made you feel unhappy in our hotel, we once again sincerely apologize. We will strengthen management and training on the service quality and service quality of our employees, so as to better serve our customers. In addition, because the hotel is an independent resort hotel and is not in the downtown area (about a three-minute drive from the city), it is located on the hillside by the Qiandao Lake, so taxis need to be calculated by charter ( From the city to the holiday 10 yuan/car, from the holiday to the city because it needs to be booked, it is 15 yuan/car, the city 2 yuan/person refers to the price on a fixed line, which can carry different guests at the same time) 
0	The hotel is very poor, and the service is really intolerable. It is an old-fashioned hotel with a four-star price, which is far worse than the nearby Anyang Hotel and Zhongyuan Hotel. The price is expensive, and I will not stay next time. 
1	The location of the hotel is a bit off, but it is worthy of the former Shangri-La, the hardware and services are still good, the crib provided is great, but the Internet broadband is charged, which is not in line with the international trend 
1	I went to Wuxi last weekend and saw the recommendations of all netizens. The friendship I lived in, I felt pretty good overall. The overall situation is basically what the previous netizens have said, the surrounding environment of the hotel is average, of course it can't be compared with the scenic area, and it can't be regarded as noisy, the general urban area is probably like this. Fortunately, the hotel is bent inside, so basically it has no effect. There is some convenience on the side of the hotel, Tesco a little further away, and the traffic is very convenient. The bed in the room is harder, the bathroom is smaller, and the computer virus is more powerful, but overall the flaws are not concealed. We stayed in the business room in Building 2. The room was large and clean, and the bathroom was very clean. The service attitude of the hotel is very good, and the check-in and check-out speeds are also very fast. It is especially worth mentioning that the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are very good, at least to our appetite. I heard a local person nearby said this The Wuxi cuisine on the side is very authentic. Is a very cost-effective hotel. 
0	"1 The battery is not as good as expected. The full display is more than 7 hours, which is a bit depressing. 2 It is really easy to leave fingerprints. 3 Besides the fan, there is a ""squeaking"" sound. I don't know if it is a computer problem. . Don't understand. . . 4I suggest you bring your own mouse at any time~~ Finished, thank you "
1	My little girl just entered the first grade. I read this book to her. She liked and yearned Doudou's life very much. As a result, she copied Doudou's actions in class: opening and closing the textbook during class, opening and closing. The teacher called her up and punished her to stand aside. As a result, she was like Xiaodoudou, indifferent to the punishment station, immersed in her small universe. The final result, of course, was the same as Doudou, who was invited by his parents. I had no choice but to tell her that although the book is also true, you can't move the book to your life and repeat it; otherwise, if you are expelled from school, your mother will be fine. Dizzy~ 
0	"""Lust, Caution"" is a book that sells dog meat. I originally bought it and prepared to read novels, but it turned out to be a collection of short stories. Online shopping is flawed, because we can't go to the book to buy, buy The reader should explain it as necessary and clear at a glance, even if you add a sentence? Short story collection?, the reader will not be so disappointed with the book, ah... "
0	In Nanyang, I am still the only one in Nanyang. I have no choice. Of course, I have to choose when I go for the second time. I hope that Ctrip will work hard to add other hotels in Nanyang. The price of Golden Hyatt Oriental is too expensive, which is too far from the price level of Nanyang. Moreover, the rooms reserved for Ctrip are all leftovers around the corner. I am really annoyed. I always have the feeling of being held down by others. I can't find a sense of God. In short, bad! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Service, bad! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	This hotel should be good, the price is reasonable in Beijing. 
0	"My son is one and a half years old, and I bought him a crackle book before. It is very good and my son likes it. I also benefit from the loyal users of Dangdang.com. When I saw this set of books this time, everyone said it was good and bought it for my son, but my son didn't like it and said ""not good-looking"". There are several reasons: 1. The screen is simple, and some are basically a line of text on a blank page. 2. The painting is also general 3. The storyline is relatively simple. 4. The paper is thinner. 5. Personally think that this set of books is more suitable for children 1 year old or younger. Of course, there are many advantages. Each of the 12 books has a story, and daily life stories, which can help babies develop good habits. And these shortcomings are advantages for little babies. After I got the book, I regretted buying it for my son and wanted to transfer it. "
0	The heat is a bit high, and there are some slight scratches on the cover surface of my machine when it is taken out. A protective film should be attached to the surface when packaging. It can play 720P HD and not stuck! But I tried the meeting card at 1080P, consider changing to 2G memory... 
1	It is a good choice in Tongxiang, with a large lobby. Convenient taxi. 
1	The screen is large enough, which is the main reason why I bought it. Also, people around me have a good opinion of Asus. I just used it a few times and it's not bad. 
1	Very cost-effective, very practical, with the addition of Samsung 2g memory, the speed is very fast, can satisfy more than 95% of the people in the society, there is no more cost-effective machine than this, the configuration is very balanced 
0	In fact, I like the content of this book, but I think the quality of this book is very poor. Today I received a new book from your website, but there are serious creases on the cover of the book. Is this how your website operates? 
1	I personally think that the portrayal of the characters is more detailed and true, and people in the officialdom can take a look. It is not without merit. The deep meaning can only be unspeakable. Even so, I still feel that I feel less relaxed, which may have something to do with my pessimism. It doesn't matter if you look at this kind of book. As for some people say that the plot is fake or something, I think you don't have to go into it deeply, and you don't have to check in on the plot. As for what is worth learning, it is also used by everyone 
1	The rooms are nice, although a little small, but very practical. Broadband is fast. However, the previous friends said that the sound insulation effect is poor, which is indeed a bit. Upon closer inspection, it is found that the wall behind the door is of wooden structure. Everything else is good. Breakfast couldn't be more ordinary. Can be ignored. 
0	The packaging is exquisite, the content is flashy, and the Korean humor is really not good! It doesn't sound good, it's just shit! 
0	The decoration of the hotel I stayed in was outdated, and the central air conditioner was so cold that I had to give the waiter a blanket, which made me catch a cold. Four stars are not real! ! 
0	"My language level is limited, and I don’t know whether ""collusion"" and ""communication"" are common. I see the former used in several places, and sometimes use the latter. The story was written in general, at least after I read ""Up and Down"", the story seemed less exciting and attractive. It's nothing more than a story about a girl who used every opportunity to improve. The characters are not well written enough to give people a deep impression, and the story has no ups and downs. It is relatively plain. Many people come in this way in their lives. Maybe it has something to do with my own work. The plot, story, and scenes in the book are all too familiar and not new. I just don't like this book. It has a certain effect on newcomers in the workplace. "
1	"Unexpectedly, a hotel highly recommended. If you visit the Xihai Grand Canyon, it is a perfect place to stay. This is the third time I have visited Huangshan. I know it is wet. I have read the posts on this site and are mentally prepared. But this hotel room doesn't feel wet at all. The electric heater sheet works well (Siemens) and the room is warm enough. I remember coming to Huangshan before (10 years ago and 23 years ago), and staying in a hotel of more than 800 yuan, but the quilt seemed to be able to wring out water. I grew up in the South and had a certain ability to adapt to humidity, but the humidity in the mountains at that time still made me almost unacceptable. However, considering the local environment, it is excusable. However, this time LP (the northerners who haven't been out much) still felt that the mattress was a bit ""trendy"", but it was also very good. In my opinion, the so-called ""tide"" is only the ""coolness"" caused by the southern weather. Northerners are not used to it. The bath water is good. I didn't bring my own dry food to the restaurant, so I didn't have a say in the price of the dishes. The waitress at the front desk is also very nice. Although I don't have any special enthusiasm, I am very professional and I am happy to answer any questions. In short, this stay was a pleasant surprise to avoid the suffering of ""damp"". You know, how happy it is to have a comfortable couch after walking so many mountain roads. highly recommended. (Note: Of course, friends who want to go up the mountain do not compare the house price here with other houses with the same house price. I think that comparison is meaningless) "
1	Can not impress people, the old five-star, the price is relatively low. . . Can stay. . 
0	Because of the return and exchange of Dangdang, I thoroughly realized that Dangdang only buys and does not return, at least not sincerely, and let us understand that Dangdang is not honest. 
1	This is the second one I bought, and it's all for good friends~~~~ 
0	When I received this set of books, I paid for it without opening it. Then I folded it and saw that the set of books was not complete. I ordered a new book, but all the new books have arrived on Monday, and today I have returned the book on Thursday but have not arrived yet. The cancellation and ordering are processed on the same day, which is really incomprehensible! 
0	The surrounding environment is very quiet, not far from Tianmen Mountain and the airport, and the pick-up service is also very convenient. It is very inconvenient to walk around, and it is far from the downtown area. The rooms are relatively small, dirty and old, and the sheets are not very clean. The metal under the cold kettle has fallen off and is moldy. I dare not use it. Even the cold water has precipitated impurities. I did not dare to drink. The shower room is prone to leaking and the floor becomes very wet. Breakfast is not very good. Not good. It feels a bit fooled to see the overall score. 
1	All-metal shell machine SSD is fast, 3-cell battery is enough, 6-cell will highlight a piece that affects beauty and carrying 
1	Hotel service is in place, always considerate to customers. The room is clean. Will stay next time. Additional comment July 2, 2008: Miss Yan Lei's service is very good. 
1	Basically, I judge the quality of the work based on whether I cry or not (abnormal......= =). But the book that made me cry so many times is only one in my memory since I was little (the only one I read is the classic literature about crying). Looking at the text, you can really feel that they are vividly in front of you. When Li Qing slowly began to remember his younger brother, he always felt a sad air rising, rising, enveloping people reading the text, and even eager to shout and cry instead of him... In short, the book is called Classic, it's a pity to miss it~ 
0	I booked a room through Ctrip on February 20, and it turned out that there is no ordinary standard room but only an administrative standard room. After checking in, I found that the administrative standard room is basically an ordinary standard room. It is estimated that the hotel and Ctrip are sloppy, and the price of 298 is really not worth it. Later, I saw the four-star Zhangzhou Hotel when I was shopping, and I really regretted not staying there. It was only 100 yuan expensive. And when I checked out, I actually charged a laundry fee on the grounds that my nephew had a nosebleed and soiled the quilt. Contempt~~ 
0	It took 20 minutes to check in at the front desk and 25 minutes to check out. This is because of the attitude of service and failure. I have swiped my credit card several times, and I am unwilling to manually call for authorization. The extremely poor service attitude of a typical state-owned enterprise. 
1	A machine with a good price/performance ratio! With 1G of memory, it will not run too slowly... Adding the above transport will be even more favorable~~~ 
1	"The furniture is too old and the breakfast is simple. None of this is said. What makes me angry is that the 300 yuan in my trouser pocket forgot to take it out before the laundry notice. It was gone when I remembered it 4 hours later and asked about it. The waiter in the housekeeping center told me sweetly: ""I really didn't see it. We did three inspections before the laundry. Please look for it again."" I don't want to wrong them. I searched all the places but nothing. Nothing to say.... Won't live there again next time. "
0	I don't want to say too much, all the conditions of the hotel are very poor, I will never stay at this hotel again! 
0	The earphone and USB are in the lower right hand position, which affects the operation of the mouse; the 12-inch widescreen font is relatively small; there is no optical drive. 
0	"A book with no content and no particular point of view. It's nothing more than a simple piece of story, plus a few empty sermons, which is boring. If you have to buy it, it is recommended that those under 16 can try it. Those over the age of 16 are exempted. We should have already experienced and understood what it says. If you haven't experienced it yet, then believe me, reading this book will not change you or anything. The most quintessential part of the book is the preface written by Chen Yalin, which is far more true. ""Please be loyal to your own happiness"" is the only sentence that left an impression on me. "
1	Cheap. It used to be a LINUX system. Once I got it back, I didn’t need to reinstall XP directly. The speed is very fast after installation. 
1	I kept the business machine stable. It was 4999, which is worth the price. It is a bit troublesome to modify XP. At first, I always make mistakes. Later, I read the previous brother said that I should change sata to IDE in BIOS. After the change, it really works. After repartitioning, the installation went smoothly and it is currently running stably. A brother said that the driver of the network card was lost. I also encountered it. Later, after changing to a version of XPSP3, it was all right (XPSP2 was installed at the beginning). 
1	Equivalent to a five-star service, better than a four-star breakfast, almost three-star room rate is to borrow something. Supplementary review May 12, 2008: There is an Indian ah three, very stylish, warm service 
0	I’m out of luck. It’s bad to buy it and open the box with the down arrow key. I have to call the ACER repair station to open a test order, and then I have to fill in the online form to apply for the warranty... It completely reflects the defects of online shopping --When there is a problem, it is troublesome. I hope Jingdong will help me solve it as soon as possible. The screen can only be opened 90 degrees. 
1	Excellent workmanship, complete functions, camera, fingerprint, one can not be less, the bag is very easy to use, can kill the bag below 300 on the market, the mouse sent is also very good, compared with last year, a little bit different, the mouse back is a bit high, It feels very good, the driver disk does not have an xp driver 
1	"Many ideas nowadays do have many problems such as inversion, misplacement and misunderstanding. This is a very good book that allows us to rethink what the values of life should be, and what principles and hearts should be upheld to see, think, and do things! Everyone is more or less exposed to all kinds of ""devil's temptations"" every day, lusting for life, troubles will follow one after another. The question is, do you have the insight to see the results clearly and are mentally prepared to bear it? This book is the only one worth reading more than twice among the books I bought this year! The Zen language is worth reading and rereading... "
1	The hotel is good overall, stayed twice. There is no difference between 360 and 410 rooms. 
1	Our day in learning Buffett is not all about making money, but learning Buffett’s basic principles of life, work, and investment. These principles reflect the wisdom of the masters; they can help us free ourselves from the confusion in life, career, and investment, and find a true long-term The right path to success. The advantage of this excellent biography is that if you are not an investor yet. It can help you become an investor; if you are already an investor, it can make you a better investor. 
0	The keyboard is small, and the ratio is not the same as the normal keyboard. I always use 1 key to select characters when I use the full spell when chatting on MSN. As a result, I always press the F1 help window. F1~F10 are rarely used function keys. , Wouldn't it be better if the damping can be set larger than other keys?

1	"I bought this book because of its beautiful name and the words of Zhang Xiaoxian, Baby Annie and other authors I like at the back of the book. The story of this book is quite fascinating, but after reading it, I feel that the plot is a bit clichéd, ha ha. However, the portrayal of the protagonist of the story, Sun Jiayu, is quite good. I like him a lot. But the real touch and being in it still depends on watching ""The Year in a Hurry"" and ""Love in the Hawthorn Tree""! "
1	"Every child is as simple as an elf. ""Absolute Kid"", ha ha, a book I love. Perhaps it is related to age. Now seeing some words and pictures like this makes it easy and pleasant. Will make my heart suddenly return to that scene when I was a child. Those people, those things, quietly emerged. This is a very strange feeling. Maybe. The fun of innocence does not necessarily have to be age-related. But, for ourselves, keep an optimistic attitude and face everything. It is rare. I think. As long as we want. At any time, you can just be a child. "
1	Long battery life, about 7 hours, small size, good keyboard, and XP system, more worry-free, easy to partition yourself 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the floating keyboard is beautiful, the speed is good, and the color of the LED screen is good. Send an anti-virus software, send a cooling pad, the cooling pad has a small wind force, but it is very practical. I went home to partition and formatted, made an installation disk with Xp integrated SATA driver (refer to http://blog.chinaunix.net/u2/69856/showart_704523.html), and installed the system with SATA driver once passed. I was very pleased. 
1	Xiao Mu likes this book very much, just like Carmela's. Whether it is talking about the contents or stacking up the books in sets, they can bring him great happiness. And before Xiao Mu went to the nursery school, he and I repeatedly looked at the two books about kindergarten, let him understand that there are only teachers, children and toys in the nursery, no parents, but the teacher will love him like a mother. He, and there are many children playing with him, will be very happy. Later, Xiaomu went to the nursery to adapt quickly, and got used to it in a week. 
0	Have stayed many times, but this stay was very unpleasant! I arrived at the weekend on 07-06-8. I worked overtime to catch a file at 12 o'clock in the evening. I was about to send an email. I found that the network cable was not working. As a result, the waiter found the manager on duty, and said that there was no way, and then that it was a telecommunications problem. I said I must send this email out. But she said there was no way, the IT staff went back. I said whether I can invite him back. She said it was too late. Then he said to help me find a room online. I waited in the room until more than 1 o'clock and didn't answer, so I called to ask. The manager said there was no way to know which room was still good. I am very angry! Don't notify me if you can't find it! Let me wait in the room! Finally, I said that I can send it to the business center. This hotel, or the manager’s sense of service is too bad: they can actually toss the guests up and down, and their employees can sleep at home! It seems I am looking for a new place! 
0	I don’t know if I’m stupid. I can’t contact the customer service to check and I can’t find out where my book is. I’m speechless... It’s not the largest in the world. It seems that it hasn’t reached international standards. 
0	First of all, the common problem with this picture book is that it is expensive. A few sheets of paper cost tens of yuan a copy. Second, although adults can understand the mother’s love in this book, children may not understand. Third, the drawing style is that of foreign children, and Chinese children are not so crazy. Fourth, the book is excessively flattered. Make people feel fooled 
1	Because I checked Ctrip's reviews before, I didn't expect much of this hotel. But after moving in, it feels okay overall. Although there is still a gap between five-star ratings, it should be acceptable in Jilin. There seemed to be no suitable restaurants around the hotel. Finally, I had a Brazilian barbecue buffet at the hotel, which was 88 yuan more expensive than other places, and the level was average. Another is that the bathroom is really small. 
1	A very nice five-star hotel with large rooms and new facilities. It is importantly located in the financial center. It is very convenient to go anywhere. I will consider staying again in the future. 
1	I bought a lot of books on Dangdang, and I was too lazy to comment. But this set of books is really good, all 3 books are very exciting. My little one's daughter, who knows many words, loves her very much, she must read before going to bed every day. She also told me that there are the same articles in the school's Chinese textbook. I also lent it to my colleague’s daughter. My colleague has always had a headache. Her daughter does not like to read books, but her daughter likes this set of books very much. Read it in two weeks. It is recommended to buy. I rarely write reviews, but I can’t help writing for this set. Also give other readers reference. 
0	The quality of the matching drive CD is too bad, my mobile CD drive cannot recognize it, and it is very difficult to read it on the CD drive of the computer. The quality of the disc is not satisfactory, but fortunately, there is a network to download. However, ASUS's support website always displays errors, which is really dizzy. 
0	This set of books has vivid pictures, pays attention to the details of life, and is very attractive to children. The colleagues who are reading understand the common sense of life/experience some interesting processes. Satisfaction! 
0	Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! 
0	The bathroom standard of the room is too bad, the drain of the basin is broken, and I have to use my hands to pull out the drain. . . The switch of the light in the wardrobe is broken, and the light is still on when the door is closed. There are two cockroach-killing boxes stuck in the bathroom, which makes people uncomfortable. 
0	Ordered on March 1st, and it hasn't arrived on March 15th. The customer service said every day that the next working day will arrive for 5 consecutive days. I am speechless. Those who want to read this book earlier should go to Taobao or Zhuoyue to order, especially friends from Guangdong Province. Dangdang delivery is too unguaranteed. 
1	It looks okay. She likes it as a gift to her wife. The system runs smoothly. You can show her online movies 
0	55555555, one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in, I advise everyone to run farther. 
0	I was ranked first in the rankings, so I bought it and I was very disappointed. I bought no less than 30 books on Dangdang. This book is the worst, so I can’t help but say it. It's not easy to use and not practical. To sum it up, drinking a cup of honey in the morning and evening can beautify your face. Not recommend everyone to buy 
0	It takes half an hour to register a house. The whole lobby is like a market! The room layout is extremely poor! 
0	Moved. There is also a heart-wrenching sorrow. After reading it, I will never forget it. I am afraid of being filmed into a movie and TV, which will destroy the beautiful image of the character in my heart. Too moved 
0	The book exchange requires the customer to mail it to Beijing. The postage is equivalent to the book fee. Is it necessary to exchange the book? Isn't it better to buy a new book? Your service like this is very disappointing. 
1	It's a pity that the hardware facilities are not complete, and the noise from the roadside leaves a little regret for what should be a perfect hotel. I hope that Home Inns franchise stores will take a step forward. 
0	The writing method is indeed novel, but it is a pity that it lacks literary attainments: the marketization of language and the entertainment of expression are ultimately difficult to pass down to the world. Nowadays, Chinese vulgar literature (not popular literature!) has prevailed over and over again, and Chinese culture is worrying! No wonder that China has been traversed for thousands of years. There is no mention of classics, and there is no one of the four masterpieces! It is a pity that the money is. 
0	The service is poor and the quality of the book is poor. I suggest you not to buy it. Dangdang's books are very old. The most important thing is that the service is poor. One phone station will deceive people and shirk responsibility. 
0	Does it not support fingerprint? The driver is installed successfully, but I don’t know where to swipe my finger. No other problems have been found yet. 
1	The surrounding environment is very good. The sea can be seen from the room. The common room is very average. It is recommended to live in the deluxe room. The price is not much different. The deluxe room is very large. There is enough space for three large beds. Very good. You can also see The sea 
1	Although Nana talked about Benna's time in Happy Camp, she mainly went inside. In fact, it’s still very festive to go inside. Haha. I told a lot of Nana’s own stories and feelings. Some are very funny. In Luyu I had a meeting with Nana and mentioned many of her own stories, but the book is more detailed. I feel very happy and happy when I look at it. Nana is very cute. There is also a story about what happened before Nana's family. The writing is as optimistic as Nana, but there is still sadness. Nana is very distressing. Come on, Nana! ! The scope of your happiness is no longer a small one~~~~ Hahaha 
0	"I bought Bi Shumin's ""Female Psychologist"" with great anticipation. I was full of expectations for this work before I read it, because I have read a lot of Bi Shumin's works. I really like the story after story she tells in plain, philosophical and concise language, especially the ""Women Worker"" that she read in 2008. I read it many times in a row and I like it very much. To be honest, I felt a little disappointed after reading ""Female Psychologist"". Although I am a science student, I like reading very much. He Dun, the protagonist of this work, is a humble but clever person who has certain pursuits due to his own background. With constant efforts, he obtained the qualification of a psychologist. In order to open a clinic, he married a man with a kind heart but no feelings at all. I don’t know, what does such a heroine bring to readers? At the same time, several stories in the work are far from daily life, and I feel that the author writes purely for writing and is worthless. Except for a few sentences that leave me with some impressions, the rest are forgotten after reading the book. Up. What a disappointment! "
1	It's for the smoking and non-smoking areas again! I always said no at the beginning, but I can still find it in the end. I really don't understand. Hotel feedback July 8, 2008: Your valuable comments have been highly valued by our hotel management. We have strengthened our attention to the needs of guests for smoking and non-smoking rooms from the reservation to the front desk. But if the hotel room is special When you are nervous, the hotel can only make smoking rooms smoke-free, please understand! Welcome you to continue to stay in our hotel next time! 
0	Insufficiency: I don't know how to dissipate the heat for a long time, it has not been used for a long time. The attached CD does not have an XP driver, it is troublesome to download by yourself 
0	The hotel facilities are relatively outdated. The room we stayed in is close to the exhaust duct of the kitchen. The noise is very loud. We asked to change the room. The hotel replied that the restaurant will rest at 9:30 in the evening, which will not affect the rest. But at 5-6 in the morning, the restaurant’s breakfast again affected the rest. It’s too unreasonable for the hotel to adopt this method of concealing it. 
1	The performance is stable and easy to use, but it is a bit more troublesome to install the system. It is difficult for people who do not understand computers to install this system 
0	The special room is very small. Four steps to the corner of the room are basically separated by non-sound-proof panels. The sound of the TV next door and the moaning of men and women working in the night and the sound of bathing in the adjacent room can be clearly heard. It is just a gun for netizens to meet. The air quality in the room is very poor and cannot be exhausted by ventilation. The price of Ctrip is the same as the retail price. The main consideration is that the place of work is nearby. 
0	This book is only worthy of entertainment and entertainment, and does not have any academic nature, because the basic science is not enough, that is, the minimum accuracy can not be achieved. 
1	The LED screen is still good, but it is too bright and a bit reflective. The multifunctional touchpad is also a highlight 
0	The inconvenience of transportation is the most disappointing place of this place. I stayed for three days. On the first day, I couldn’t get a taxi. The driver of the hotel drove a business car and even charged me 40 yuan to get a taxi. 20 yuan. It's not the money issue, but the act of taking advantage of the fire and robbery really makes me angry. On the second night in the room, there was no air conditioner, but only slowly blowing. And the soundproofing of the room is not very good, you can hear the singing of KTV and nightclub during the day and night. Originally, I still liked the hotel room design and style, but after experiencing the above, I really can’t compliment it in the future. 
0	I visited this hotel last year. At that time, I stayed in a non-smoking room. I felt fine. This time I stayed in a superior standard room. When I entered the room, there was a strange smell asking the front desk to change room. There is a strange smell. However, the walls of the room were very dirty. I thought about it later and didn't change it. However, I feel that this year's Jinding has a much worse sanitation than last year, and the decoration is old! 
1	"He used to read to his son, he always ran away after listening. ""Hush! ""We are Sleeping"" is the first time he has heard a story completely. It seems that this language style is more suitable for children. ""Mom, talk about sleeping!"" As soon as I got home these days, my son pestered me to talk. As long as the child likes it, it is better than anything! Of course, what I fancy most is the knowledge points inside, which are not only interesting, but also integrated into the story. It also provides a good example for me to convey other content to my children. "
1	Sometimes, the standard of a good book is not how ups and downs the plot, how magnificent the scene is described, how deep the social significance it implies, these are not the purpose of reading in many cases. When modern life is getting faster and more stressful, a good book is a good book that can make bored people happy while reading. The classic of this book lies here. I have given this book to a friend because I want to share a good mood. 
1	The train was late, and I changed my mind to stay at the hotel temporarily, and did not deliberately choose. However, the Quzhou Hotel is not bad, it is checkin in the early morning. It took another day to catch the train. 
0	I thought it was a good book in the online reviews, and I felt that I must read it, otherwise I am afraid that I will regret it when I am in my 20s. But I didn't feel much content when I read it. I felt a little fooled. I didn't like it. The content was very superficial. The writing was very realistic, but a little boring. 
1	The delivery speed is very fast, with the inner bag, the weight is heavier than expected, and it can bear, the standby time is good, and the workmanship is good. 
1	"Yes, it's been a long time, but I didn't really finish it until 3 o'clock in the morning. I knew the ending early in the morning. I still hate Jinzhi because I like Yuki, right? I’m even more extreme than the people in ""Prince Yuki"". XD Aya, I also like you very much, so I hate Meiyin XD. Finally, it turns out that God is the first to impress me with the 12 zodiac signs. God in chains. In fact, he is a lonely person. Finally, the banquet is over. I watched it with my own eyes. Really, is it over? Hope that Hongye can recognize her mother and sister. High house you...oooooooo... "
0	The book is not good, the price is expensive, and it feels cheated, especially the paper is too bad, my friends suspect that it is pirated. Check it out at the bookstore next time you shop online. 
0	A lot of what Yu Dan said is misleading the public. Just look at the many comments on the Internet. I personally think it is not worth watching!! 
1	The service is really good. I stayed after seeing the good comments of Ctrip, but it did not disappoint me. I feel that the five-star hotel has five-star service. I will choose this place next time I go to Qingdao. I have the opportunity to bring a family in the future. On holiday here, it is really pleasant, pleasant and comfortable to live here. 
1	I booked Building 5 of Xiamen Hotel, it was quiet, the room was clean, spacious and comfortable, and the service was very good. The location of the hotel is very convenient. It only costs a starting fee to get to Xiamen University and the ferry. Moreover, the hotel itself is a garden hotel and is also very beautiful. Also, the double breakfasts are also very good. In short, I like the hotel very much and I will definitely stay in Xiamen next time. 
1	"This book was bought earlier. At that time, my son was less than 2 years old. There were too many words in it, and it was too late to finish reading, but I followed his progress. I haven't watched it for a long time in the middle. Now 25 months later, he sometimes turns it out by himself and asks me to tell the story inside. I like to listen to it. The most valuable thing is that the animals inside are very delicate and the expressions are very vivid. And just after reading this book, my son doesn't reject eating vegetables. I bought him a little rabbit the day before yesterday and named him Danley. The son also said to the rabbit, ""Danley, you have a vegetable garden!"" The big disadvantage is that the words are too small. "
0	The price is not low, the grade is not high, the environment is bad, the lobby is small, the room is average, the breakfast is unpalatable, and the feeling is average! 
0	The power adapter is too big, bigger than my T61. Such a small machine should be equipped with a small one. The fever is still a bit severe. 
1	It feels very beautiful in appearance, and starting with 5399, I also sent an original backpack. Unfortunately, the bag is 15-inch, and the 14-inch notebook is a bit big to put in. By the way, I also sent a 2009 Rising Anti-Virus software. But there is already Norton in the system, so I don't feel it is needed. 
1	The price-performance ratio is super high. Although it is a DOS system, the accessories drivers for the notebook are very complete, and the drivers for XP and VISET are available. It is a miracle! 
1	Beautiful style, flat keyboard, good camera, effect is much better than expected, and microphone is more convenient to use 
0	I am very dissatisfied with the Xinyuege Inn. If there is a zero point to choose, I would rather not give it a point. Their service is too bad. It clearly includes breakfast, but the waiter didn’t know at all in the morning, or I took it early in the morning Rain went out to buy it. Even more chilling and annoying: On the morning of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the waiter sold the room to others without our knowledge, and drove me and an American couple away. I talked about this with several inns around me and everyone was shocked that there are such people! I strongly recommend that you don't live here from now on. And the price is twice that of a nearby inn. 
0	The common problem of this type of book is that the number of words is not many, and the number of pages is a lot. There are no new theories in the book, and the examples appear pale. Maybe I'm over the age to read easy-to-understand inspirational books. I just want to give it away after flipping through it. I'm not interested in staying in my bookcase. 
1	It’s not as difficult to install the system as some people said. The driver is easy to handle, but the Bluetooth driver went to the official website. The layout of the official website is not very good. It took a long time to find the model. 
1	It’s beautiful, it looks dark, I like it. In addition, the LINUX operating system customized for this book is also very suitable for this kind of little guy. 
1	Great book! Parents should read it through before reading it to their children to avoid embarrassment when the author’s views are at odds with your value orientation. I agree with 99% of the views in the book. As for the remaining 1%, my approach is: 1. I will ignore it. Or 2. Use your imagination to move the storyline as close as possible to the ending you expect. The two sons are 5 and 7 years old. I thought they might not be able to fully understand that they were small, but the result was not bad. The setbacks, worries, and fears that children encounter in school, society, and family can be found in this book. Of course, curiosity was greatly satisfied. 
1	Take the children to Hong Kong through Ctrip's free tour. Langham Place, who has lived in Mong Kok, chose Lang Court because he still likes Tsim Sha Tsui. The lobby of the hotel is nice, I don’t know why so many people are too small. I was lucky to be upgraded. I booked two rooms but the other one didn't work well. The lady at the front desk gave us a 100 yuan tax-free shop voucher for each room and took us all the way to the room, which made me flattered. The rooms have just been renovated and have oak floors, which are rare in mainland hotels. I can see a little sea view from my window. Later I saw the notice on the table and realized that the upstairs was being renovated. But we went out during the day and didn't feel it. Those days were very cool, which was really unexpected compared to 37 degrees in Shanghai. My child has been to Disney in the United States twice, so we only have the cable car and sea view here, which is the best! On the last day, I told the hotel to check out late. Children can swim and take a bath before leaving after a half-day trip. The 3-day trip was very tiring, but the hotel bed was very comfortable and I slept well at night. 
0	It's all imaginary things. She has seen as many things as she hasn't seen, and she doesn't even tell others, and she doesn't say it for nothing. 
0	I always thought it was black when changing the color of XP. The sound touch buttons didn’t work well, the heat dissipation was not good, the fan sound was too loud. 
0	Don’t buy this book. It’s not suitable for national conditions. It expresses a concept when you go around. If you want to read to your children, just condense a book into one chapter. 
1	The service attitude is very good, but it seems that the level is not as good as the attitude. Checkin&out is always the focus of complaints. It is said that the headquarters requires customers to fill in the information by themselves, which is understandable, but not letting go of toilet paper in the toilet is also a company rule? Very embarrassed, terribly. I wonder if every corner has been cleaned? How else would you forget to put toilet paper? But clean and hygienic as always, really good, but hope to strengthen the details. 
1	It is very close to the railway station, and it can be reached in 5 minutes on foot. In the city center, where to go, the traffic is more convenient. Check in late, around 10 o'clock in the evening, I wanted to order a meal and was told to get off work. I thought of buying some instant noodles at the hotel canteen, but I didn’t expect it to be closed. This was not very convenient. The room is ok. 
0	It's not bad to use, I still have a few 2000-100 1000-50 East coupons plus qq 673946022 
1	1) Metal shell, with strong technology and business atmosphere; 2) The size of the keyboard is similar to that of a normal notebook, and the fingers can be completely released without worrying about the small keyboard; 3) The running speed is fast, I have installed Vista and Windows7 RC, both It runs smoothly. I use Win7 RC for almost two months now. I have no problem surfing the Internet or watching movies. 4) It is lighter and lighter than ordinary notebooks. I took it on a business trip with my colleagues some time ago. Comparing with a large notebook, it feels light. My colleagues said that I would also buy a small notebook for business trips! 
1	The configuration is okay, there is a cost-effective, I bought it later, but the price of the computer is unreasonable. 
1	The appearance is stylish, beautiful, exquisite, and impeccable. The system comes with many new software. I like movie stories the most. You can edit videos and movie clips by yourself. There are many new features to be discovered~~ 
1	"Just finished reading Du Lala's promotion note, and found that Xiaoqiang's promotion note appeared quietly. To be honest, when I first saw the title of the book, I thought it was a bit vulgar and unattractive, but when everyone's reviews were good, I decided to buy it. The result was beyond my expectation. The time management knowledge in the book is very detailed. I have also read related books before, such as ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective People"", and have some superficial understanding of time management. I think Xiaoqiang’s promotion notes are quite systematic, and they are also interesting. I bought a few more and gave them to my colleagues. worth learning! "
0	Yu Dan talks about how to learn from Confucius and Zhuangzi every day, and how to learn from it. Many things are far-fetched and incomprehensible. Yu Dan opened his mouth and said that nothing is done for merit or profit, but why did he swagger through the market and engage in so many hype activities! After all, for what---famous and fortune. The prosperity of the world is for profit; the hustle and bustle of the world is for profit. Yu Dan is really a model of live learning and application! 
0	Typical online novels~ People with plenty of time can read it! After reading it, the characters inside don't know what they are like, and they don't know what personality they are. The characters flash by, and forget everything after reading it! The plot of the story goes over, and you know if you win a battle, how you fought, and the scene of the fight. Very disappointed, decided not to watch anymore~ 
0	"A great copy of the world’s articles. This book is too dogmatic and not practical at all. It’s better to read: How to say that children are willing to listen... Compared with ""how"", it is more interesting, practical, and more popular. I bought it A bunch of books in this area have the same content as ""how to"", so I will spend money on your behalf "
1	Good location, rich breakfast and fast internet access. It’s just that it’s no longer managed by Marriott, I hope the service level will not drop 
1	Generally speaking, it's okay, mainly because it's just right to do things, which is convenient. Basically, I will stay here in the future 
1	Now I use 541 to comment, no noise, little heat dissipation, and very good hardware. But eight hours ago, I was still studying how to install xp with the help of others! Super troublesome, gost can't install it, I can only find Panjiahuayuan. The automatic installation was successful. It took nearly three hours to wait for the installation to complete. The system prompts: You may be a victim of pirated software. It was like a friend was eating hot pot happily. When the food was almost done, the waiter suddenly said: The lamb you are eating contains avian influenza virus... 
1	The price has nothing to say, and the quality is good. I heard that the speaker is very poor, so I was mentally prepared. After I tried it, it was still within an acceptable range. I heard that the wireless network card has poor signal and easy disconnection. It is troublesome to install the system, mainly because of LINUX. After the magic partition is divided and formatted, the Dos still cannot be entered. At this time, you need to use the FDISK command, but you must add the parameter MBR, that is, type FDISK/MBR to solve the problem. 
0	Dizzy, I like it very much, five stars. . . How come you have become two stars. . . It still cannot be modified. . . 
0	Hotel facilities are poor, not like a four-star hotel at all. The side of the bathroom mirror was in tatters, and the toilet couldn't get water. There were only 3 tables for dinner in the hotel, but after waiting for more than half an hour, the waiter could not figure out which table to serve. The only satisfaction is that the room is large. 
0	Reasons to choose Haohai: None Reasons not to choose Haohai: 　　　The soundproofing effect of the room is poor; 
1	The overall feeling is better. The hardware and software have reached the 4-star standard, but there is a little peculiar smell in the room. 
1	I am a kindergarten teacher. I bought this set of books as a gift. That object—a five-year-old girl likes it so much. She will read it in bed every night. Her mother said I can read it myself. We are dazzled, but our baby loves so much. He has a very strong interest in reading, and it is uncomfortable not to look at it for a day. In fact, I first bought two of the second set and gave it to a friend's baby. I didn't expect her to like it so much, so I bought the first set as a birthday present. The advantage of this set of books is that it can cultivate children's observation ability and is more suitable for kindergarten children over 5 years old. 
0	I finally chose to try this hotel in the cold winter of 2008. I have always tried new things and I am willing to give them opportunities, but this time I was really fooled and it was not worth it. Several Achilles' heels of this apartment hotel are listed as follows: 1. The air conditioner is a mess. Low power and high noise. It’s on, no matter what it’s used for, and it’s too noisy for you to be at peace; when it’s off, you can see it when you breathe out in the room on the 27th floor. 2. Not every room has a washing machine. This is a bit false propaganda. 3. The hot and cold water heater is unstable due to water pressure. Not freezing to death is your luck. 4. There is no heating in the bathroom. If the hot water is not strong enough, you will definitely catch a cold. 5. The balcony is closed, and no entry is allowed. 6. The network crawls at the same speed as the tortoise. Generally speaking, this hotel is okay in seasons when air conditioning and hot water are not needed, but in other seasons. An apartment of 399 a night costs 12,000 a month. What kind of house can I rent in Shanghai at this price? ? ? It is recommended that the people who stay in consider carefully.

1	If my review is helpful to your book purchase, please vote for me. 
0	The six-cell battery protrudes one piece, which affects the appearance; the weight is slightly heavier than the general netbook; the touchpad is not sensitive, and the left and right buttons are not suitable; no accessories (mouse, bag); the price is slightly higher 
0	Everything downstairs is right, it's really not worth living! The location is very remote, I want to have a meal at night and I have to take a taxi out. The price is too high, and the discount of the mobile VIP card is far more favorable than Ctrip. The room was relatively large, and it turned out to be very cold at night. The waiter offered to bring a quilt over, but unfortunately it didn't come over for two days! The bathroom is as said downstairs. The socket is inside, which is very dangerous. Do you have to wait until something happens before remodeling it? Breakfast is eaten in the cafe on the first floor of the investment building in front. It is inconvenient. Moreover, the breakfast seems to have many varieties, but it seems that there is really nothing to eat. Broadband is free, but at night there are girls who call harassment, 
0	The order I placed on November 9th, but there is still no news, and the homepage is not a promotion of 6.8% off, but there are actually more than 6.8% on sale, the telephone consultation answer only According to the price of the shopping cart, Dangdang's service really needs to be improved. Don't think that it will not be enterprising when it becomes bigger. 
1	Dare to speak up! Give us directions! Point out the way forward for China! A wake-up call for the world! Open your sleeping eyes, the elites of China! Don't be drunk every day! No more slavery! To please foreigners! Recognize history and reality! we are Chinese! The blood of China is flowing in the bones! To contribute our due contributions and deeds for our soaring motherland! Although I am a civilian student! But at least I know that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country! The future of the motherland requires the concerted efforts of everyone! All right! Just say this! 
1	"Brand new appearance and 16:9 widescreen design, using the current mainstream 45nm core and 16:9 golden ratio widescreen, closely following the mainstream of the market. The line of the whole machine is very round, the ""acer"" LOGO is embedded in the center of the A cover, which is very eye-catching under the light of the lamp, and the screen follows the mainstream market. It uses a 14-inch LED backlit screen with a very good display effect. The 16:9 specification The resolution is also better matched with high-definition audio and video. It is especially commendable that the keyboard uses a chocolate keyboard similar to Sony's notebook, with prominent keys and redesigned multimedia shortcut keys. The whole machine is more solid and beautiful "
1	The thing is very small, the appearance is very beautiful, with the effect of pearl paint, the appearance process is still good, the plastic mold is good, and the speed is quite good. 
0	Acer, comes with linux. It can't be used after booting. Consult after-sales because it is not fully installed. So you can only install XP separately. Acer's own manual is not complete, the manual is simple, almost all in English. The built-in software has an English interface, which is inconvenient to install. After the installation is complete, the system has no sound and heats up. 
1	Li Ka-shing said that a person must work hard to make money before the age of 35, and after the age of 35, he must consider making money with money. In fact, even if I haven't read this sentence of Li Fuhao, it seems that people will start to consider the issue of pension after 30 years of age, so how to manage money to achieve wealth growth has become increasingly important, and this is how I am. When the desire for financial management is becoming more and more urgent, in the face of many financial products, the first thing that comes to mind is to look for a good book. This book is very practical. It has both theory and practice. It can help you understand various financial products and choose the one that suits you. In short, I have benefited a lot after reading. 
0	Who said it was good, I bought it too. But I don't understand, my mother said it was useless. Hey. . . . . . . . 
0	The booked room is for the problem room, the pump sound is too noisy, the location is a bit far from the scenic spot, and there are many bugs. 
1	Bread or not? Of course, natural demand; what does a woman who stands tiptoe on a bread tree want? Love is like opium to women, knowingly gnawing, knowingly piercing, or not turning back. Will it be because of the sentence? I will send you a song every New Year's Eve? I will remember and chew for life; I will imagine that man, remembering and playful because? Every paper airplane represents a miss. The woman who feels heavy is too melancholy. She always banished herself and sacrificed herself for the vain singing and longing. As a result, she would fall off the bread-tree, often bleeding. Sense and emotion, which is more important? 
0	Please pay attention to your shipment. I received two identical fifth copies, but the fourth one is missing. It's really a shame that the entire set of books is scrapped. 
0	I decided to book the Holiday Inn after reading the comments on the Internet. I was a little disappointed after I arrived. In order to be quiet, I set up a mountain-view room, but in the middle of the night, people's voices and resonance are louder than their own rooms. It is too noisy to sleep well. 
0	The front desk service is very poor, there is no basic smile, I don't even look at you, not even the guest house, it is obvious that the four-star brand is bought back. The decoration of the room is also very general. Fortunately, the price is not very high, but the service is high. Stayed twice, there is no sign of improvement, I won't live it next time! 
0	The great leader Chairman Mao has long criticized the Confucianism and Mencius thoughts, and has poisoned the broad masses of people for thousands of years. Chairman Mao has made a well-known conclusion. It will not help the development of modern China at all. The Chinese should be completely discarded. 
1	I bought this book because of Shi Hanbing. I have read his blog and watched his TV shows. The first is to speak for the common people and the people’s livelihood issues are intimate; the second is to have a thorough knowledge of economic phenomena and historical data, use data to speak, and use facts to speak, rather than others. The party that infringes on people's livelihood interests. This is Shi Hanbing's first book. I thought that Xidan Bookstore would ask Mr. Nuanzhi to sign it, but I missed it, sorry. Had to buy in Dangdang. This book has a unique perspective, thought-provoking, sufficient mathematics and science, three points into the woods, after reading it, I am very inspired and gain knowledge. 
1	Generally speaking, the hotel is ok, I will stay in Shenyang next time 
1	Breakfast is ok, the room is average, but the soundproofing effect is very good, although it is a big road, but there is no ridicule 
1	Originally, this book was given as a birthday gift for myself, but the delivery was a bit slow this time, but I still feel that I have gained a lot from reading it. I appreciate the words and principles. We are reluctant to abandon those we already have. Although we understand, we still don't have the courage to abandon this job like San Diego. Even though I know I don't like it, I always look forward to it. I think Santiago can categorically give up the herd because he sees the hope for the future, and I am not sure about the future yet, and I dare not let it go. 
1	"The service is not bad, but the decoration of the rooms is too old and the sound insulation is really not good. In addition, I would like to give an opinion to the housekeeping department. Can you clean up the guest room after the customer leaves the store without the guest asking for it? Finally, say ""Really don't have too much hope for breakfast!"" "
0	Basically useless and thin beyond imagination. Maybe that kid taught so much? Maybe more suitable for children under 3 years old? I don't understand 
0	The location of the hotel is quite convenient, but the hotel facilities are very old. As soon as the front desk heard that it was booked by Ctrip, the rooms were all outdated rooms with poor facilities, but the price was high. Talk to local friends, they think the price is much higher than what they ordered! Ugh…… 
1	The hotel’s transportation is not very convenient. It is far from the city. The train station is about RMB 17,8. Because it is located in the development zone, most of the people who live here come to work with various companies in the development zone, especially Chery’s suppliers. Mostly with customers. To be honest, there are some unexpected surprises. I didn't expect Wuhu to have such a cost-effective hotel. I live in an executive standard room. The room is very large. In addition to two beds, there is also a very good desk. The bathroom is dry and wet. The shower room and bathtub are for guests to take their needs. The amount of water is also sufficient. Shampoo is used. And bath lotion is not a crappy product used by most hotels, it is two large cans of household products; you can either boil water or drink the direct drinking water provided by the hotel. The service is also very good, check in and check out are very fast, all the staff who meet you will politely say hello! The doorman was very polite. There was no car at the door when he left the hotel. A doorman walked out close to one mile under the scorching sun to help me stop the car in on another road. He was really embarrassed. The room delivery speed is also very fast, and the dishes are full and delicious. In addition to ordering the room delivery menu, they can also let them choose from the Chinese food menu. The only downside may be their breakfast buffet. There was really nothing to eat, and I was late and almost all bottomed out. The waiters are not very active in adding dishes, even if they add a little bit, one person will finish it. I don’t know if it’s because the buffet breakfast is afraid that the guests will eat too much... In general, the environment and service are still good. If you have the opportunity to go again, you will still live there.

0	"To be honest, theoretically speaking, not to mention that seeking medical treatment is better than seeking self-seeking. However, many times we can only turn to others for things that we cannot accomplish by ourselves. If we are sick, we can diagnose and treat ourselves. Of course, it is very good. How many people can do this, especially when they have a serious illness, can they not seek medical advice? Because of my poor health, I bought the two books ""Seeking a doctor is worse than asking myself"". However, I found it difficult for me to implement it. There is no way, I can only go to the hospital and go to the hospital. Still have to seek medical advice. In the process of seeking medical treatment, I gradually learned some common medical knowledge and accumulated some common medical knowledge. that is it. "
1	I bought a set of black-and-white printing when I was in university in Beijing ten years ago. I liked it very much, but it was a pity that my friend snatched it away. I have wanted to buy another set for so many years, but I didn't see it in the local bookstore. Dangdang fulfilled this long-cherished wish for me, and it happened to be a special offer. I didn't spend the money on two books, which is too good value! The quality of this edition has nothing to say about the printing and pictures, and it’s a color edition. The content has not changed much from the version 10 years ago from memory. This also shows that this book can withstand the test of time. Many of the content was written when it was written. With enough effort, it will not be eliminated due to changes in the times. 
1	"The dinner in the western restaurant is good, the buffet at 68, you can eat out with your stomach. One word, great! Breakfast is far worse! Dare to call 68, one word, sweat! Hotel feedback August 14, 2008: Dear guest: Hello! Thank you for staying at Jinling Liyang Hotel! And leave us valuable opinions! For breakfast, we will make timely adjustments. We will continue to work hard and forge ahead, carry forward the service concept of ""Customer First"" in Jinling Liyang Hotel, so that every guest can leave a beautiful and deep impression on Jinling Liyang Hotel. Thank you again! welcome next time! I wish you success in your work! Healthy body! Director of Guest Relations at Jinling Liyang Hotel "
0	The room in the shop is too small and the design is unreasonable. There are too few elevators, and there are only two elevators on 30 floors. For breakfast, you need to go to the third floor and walk a long corridor before transferring to the 37th floor. It takes at least 5 minutes to wait for an elevator. The price is also expensive, plus breakfast and broadband costs, not much different from a five-star hotel. Hotel feedback April 25, 2008: The first thing that needs to be corrected is that my hotel has a total of 29 floors, and the breakfast is on the 27th floor. There are three elevators. The rooms are different in size. Maybe your stay is relatively small this time. , Regarding broadband, in 2008, we have already free broadband, and give Ctrip users early discounts, hope you continue to support!!! 
1	"Parents bear unshirkable responsibilities in the growth of their children, and they also play a pivotal role. Long Yingtai's sons will be honest and kind people in the future. With such a similar friendship between mother and child, children will not learn badly, and success and failure in life are not important to open-minded parents. What matters is whether the child is happy! Friends can also watch Long Yingtai’s ""Child, Take Your Time"" to learn about the growth of two Chinese and Western sons.

0	The machine I received is a bare metal, without a pre-installed system, and no installation disc, it hurts me to install the system 
0	Things are good, better than expected, and the price is good. JD’s delivery speed must also be praised! 
0	I thought it was about writing some answers to my inner problems, but who knew it was just a story about feelings. I really feel deceived, deceived by the author. 
1	Small and light, large capacity, fast speed, good color and luster... It is a good choice for the brother who is going to propose! 
0	Without the optical drive, the card reader does not have a sealing gasket, so I had to take a TF-SD card holder and plug it in for a substitute. The rear side of A is a little loose and the screen cable is exposed. 
1	The machine was chosen by myself, and the price is the price. After getting it, I found it was better than expected. Jingdong delivery is also timely, which is very good. 
0	It is too much trouble to install the system! ! ! When I first bought it, the USB port didn’t work well. Later, I called HP’s customer service to find out how to install the system. It took more than an hour to make the phone call and it was a waste 
1	The price configuration is good, the keyboard is comfortable to use, and looks good. The delivery is also very affordable. 
1	The Friendship Hotel has a beautiful environment, fresh air, good hardware facilities and good service. The Russian cuisine in the Vasily Tavern is very distinctive. There are many foreigners here, and living here is like vacationing abroad. It’s three minutes away from the hotel’s exclusive bathing beach. As advertised, I have been to Beidaihe many times. The environment here is the best. I will choose here next time I come to Beidaihe. 
1	Advantages: The room conditions are simple, the atmosphere is warm, the accommodation environment is relatively quiet, the price is relatively reasonable, and the service attitude is good; Insufficiency: The windows are almost as high as the roof behind, and there is no anti-theft window (net), so the sense of security is not high. 
0	I have evaluated this book before. It turned out that I bought two sets because of a hand error. My money~~~ So, evaluate again! I really regret buying this set of books, especially, I actually bought two sets. The intestines are all regretful. When I bought so many books, I also picked them with high reputation and high level. It can be seen that it is difficult to tune in, and a good reputation may not please everyone. This story is the least logical in traversal that I have seen. . 
1	The location is very good and convenient. The service is not bad. The price is still very worthwhile. 
0	Seeing so many recommendations, I also bought a set for my baby. I only read one? I want to have a star?, it doesn't feel very good, and the baby doesn't like it very much. Maybe it's still young and can't understand it 20 months). It's a bit strange how so many people recommend 
1	My friend is Qianmi~ I bought this book for her. The following is her comment: This is a very cool book. It is like a travel note that introduces Liu Qian himself to various magic conventions and his participation in these conventions. The experience of the game. At the same time it brings together the growth stories of the world's outstanding magic masters. There is also a magic classroom for masters. In fact, it is more like a diary. Liu Qian uses the tone of an old friend to tell readers the truest side of himself. It is indeed a good book that you have no reason to miss. I love Liu Qian the most-Xiang 
0	Up to now, I haven't got the book, because your courier can't understand Mandarin, and the parcel doesn't have my address. This poor aunt courier can't find my place and can't deliver it. I don’t speak Shaanxi dialect. I can’t communicate. I can only wait for the aunt to return the goods and then deliver them again. 
0	I don't like the works of this kind of subject matter, it is too heavy. A lot of it is related to personal preference. I don't like the work of rural subjects. The reality is too cruel and unbearable. 
1	The CPU/graphics card configuration is high, suitable for entry-level graphics and business. The price is more affordable than other configurations. Pre-installed VISTA HOME BASIC version (better than nothing) 
0	Very unpleasant stay. My friend arrived at around 11:30 in the evening. At this time, there was only 1 person at the counter, and there were only 3 people in the lobby including the waiter. Because they were older, they wanted the waiter to help with their luggage. After beckoning, they ignored it and ran. open. When I checked in, I even swiped two credit cards and even said that the credit card is not available, which is very inexplicable. The facilities of the room are very poor, the lights are very dark, and the things in the hotel are very shabby, which really detracts from the 5-star standard. No wonder friends would say that there are very few guests in this hotel and they are scared away. It's really shameful to be still near the bustling Nanjing Road. 
1	As the root of Chinese culture, the Book of Changes has long been studied by only a few people. When most people hear Yi, they feel very mysterious and think that it is not something ordinary people can learn. However, this book makes it easy for anyone interested in Yixue to get started quickly. Of course, the easy-to-learn culture is broad and profound. Even after reading this book, it is still only the process of getting started. If you want to really master it, you still need a lot of later learning. As a book of enlightenment, this book is rare. 
1	The white one is very beautiful, and the weight is within an acceptable range. It seems to be faster than the N280, is it an illusion? 
0	It is very troublesome to install xp. I first encountered the /mbr problem. After 3 hours of tossing, then I installed the deep xp6.2, and started to report a memory error, and later reported that hal.dll could not be found. I checked it online and some said There is a memory problem. Bless the quality of the computer does not go wrong, online shopping is very troublesome! 
0	The hotel is relatively old, the facilities are relatively old, and the room service staff is relatively indifferent, not speaking Mandarin, which makes us outsiders feel a little troublesome. You can't boil water in the room, you need to call the waiter to bring boiled water. 
1	There is a computer in the room. Although the condition of the room is a bit crude, the environment, service and meals are still very good. If I go to Wuxi next time, I will still choose here. 
0	I booked a deluxe room, but I don’t know why it is room 302, which is the innermost corner of the annex building. There is no scenery, facing a dismantled billboard iron shelf. . . I didn't understand why the front desk gave me this room, and I didn't argue with them about it, and I didn't want to affect my holiday mood. So the room, environment, and service are all given 1 point. Ctrip's introduction is too simple and unclear. 
1	I have never liked drinking water, although my classmates said that drinking water is good for the body. But I won’t be thirsty anymore, so I can’t drink water. But after reading this book, I realized that water is the best medicine and the best resource for the human body. But be careful, drinking too much water is good, but the question is what kind of water is good for the body. Chen Shui certainly cannot benefit from it. The tap water is not very good either. I buy pure still water produced in the last month or two. And don’t drink the water in the water tank for more than three days 
0	Objectively speaking, it's just a little bit of my own experience and the accumulation of hard work. The professionalism and system are not enough, and the so-called empirical methods inside need further research. 
0	If you have worked in a foreign company, especially if you are a human resource in a foreign company, you will feel that what the author writes is not new, and the great principles that Lala talks about are all in the book. The author's description of the characters is too superficial, really disappointed. 
1	The location is very good, very close to Dongjiekou, and the service is very good. Someone was guided to the room all the way to make oolong tea. There is a computer in the room, and the wife can use it when I go out to work during the day. Apart from the slightly outdated furniture and facilities, the hotel has no shortcomings except that the breakfast is relatively ordinary. At night, many people of all kinds run to the nightclub on the 6th floor, and many people come out drunk. The hotel has only recently been upgraded to 4 stars, but I still feel that it is still not up to the new 4-star standard, but at least it is worth the price. Additional comments July 27, 2008: Same as the following comment, the waiter will take the initiative to take my own laundry to the balcony to dry, and leave a note, like it. 
1	The performance is good, the system is installed and used, and the response speed is very good, whether it is watching HD, or surfing the Internet, or daily work. I just received a dark spot, which is not so good 
1	I read this book because my sister’s child wanted it, so I bought it, and used my spare time to read the book before sending it. The child’s pure heart, naive imagination, and desire to be heard are all small things all the time. I am no longer moving. Although I do not have a child, I still can’t really understand the child’s inner needs, but at least I know that the child also needs to understand, encourage, and treat each other sincerely. Treat it as your closest friend. I suggest everyone take a look at this book. 
1	This time I came to Nanjing and found out that this hotel is a cooperation hotel between Nagoya and Nanjing. The name is just one word for the two cities. No wonder it feels a little strange. It belongs to an earlier five-star hotel. The management is relatively complete, manifested in check in/out, service, elevator speed, etc. The only thing is that calling a taxi at the door is not easy, and the door is too unpretentious. Overall it is still a fairly satisfactory five-star hotel. 
0	When the door was picked up, JD.com actually took back the original plastic bag. Without this plastic bag, it is very inconvenient for users to pick up. The inspection machine must be inspected after the user has paid the payment, but after the payment is completed, the machine must be disassembled for inspection and packed after the inspection. No technicians provided any technical assistance during the inspection process. 
1	After comparing the GATEWAY model with this model, I finally took a fancy to the three-year warranty of Acer. 1. Install the system: Many people have complained that the system is difficult to install. It is recommended that you use the deep 6.2 version of XP, which comes with sata driver, so there is no need to change the bios setting when installing. 2. Heat dissipation problem: Since the system has been powered on for 10 hours continuously, the touchpad is the hot spot, but it is definitely not hot. So I personally feel that heat dissipation cannot be said to be good, but it is not bad either. In addition, the notebook will definitely be hot. If you don't want it hot, you can spend twice as much money to buy Xiaohei. 
1	The breakfast is Chinese and some things are strange. There is a charge for parking at the hotel, which should not be. 
0	ASUS has installed too much software in it, which affects the boot speed! The genuine system is not used to using it, so I plan to switch to XP! The high configuration is not as fast as my old desktop (AMD2200+1.50GH2 768M). I don’t know what caused it? 
1	The location is not bad, the hotel room is a bit old, but it doesn't affect anything. It's just that the soundproofing of the room is relatively poor, and the people next to the room can hear clearly when entering and leaving the room. Sometimes it affects sleep. 
1	The process design and workmanship are good, the battery, wireless, and heat dissipation are excellent. The performance of the CPU N280 exceeds my expectations and is sufficient for general applications. The quality of ASUS is okay, and it is worth spending a few hundred yuan more for this. 
0	The screen is a little bit flawed~~~ The heat dissipation is slightly lacking~ There are only 2 USB ports, not the 3 marked above~~ 
0	The memory is too small, the system is not installed, and there is no Bluetooth. The chipset is too bad! Dual channel memory is not supported! 
1	Piano paint, streamlined body, very beautiful. There is almost no noise, and I think the heat dissipation is pretty good. 
0	The battery is weak, especially under the operation of MAFEE, watching 1280*720 movies can not support two hours 
0	It’s more troublesome to install the system. It is necessary to prepare a system disk. Other drivers are easy to find. They are easy to find on the official website. It is a little troublesome when installing the wireless driver. First, download the driver wizard and find the latest driver download solution. 
0	I encountered this treatment the first time I bought a book. I called back and forth, sent emails, and sent back packages. I didn't want to reimburse me for the postage!! I was really disappointed in Dangdang! 
0	There are always a lot of people following the trend, and I followed one this time. As expected, the content is mediocre, and there is no readability at all. 
0	In this hotel, the soundproofing is too poor and they are all separated by wooden boards. There is a pure drinking water port, but if it is broken, there is no free mineral water. The room setting is also bad. There is no water coming out of the shower in my colleague’s room. I advise everyone not to live. 
0	The power adapter is very hot. It’s really hot. And there are many things in the computer that are not installed. You have to do it yourself. There is no mouse, no protective film, no anti-virus software, no mouse pad, basically nothing. 
0	Very rubbish book, many of the words in this book are not commonly used, and the memory method is far different than that in the commentary. And there is no phonetic transcription, etc. 
1	The appearance is good, Dolby sound is very shocking, the configuration is not behind, 3799 is worth the price. The chipset is GM45 instead of the GL40 that I am worried about. After a long boot, the memory occupies more than 40%. No dead pixels are found. Like one! Orders placed on the afternoon of April 30, and picked up on the morning of the 1st. 
1	The battery is good, and the screen is beautiful. It can last for 6 and a half hours when surfing the Internet and chatting, which is not bad 
0	VISTA is too difficult to use. If there is no CD-ROM drive, can't the manufacturer make one? It won't cost a few cents to get a CD-ROM, so it should be people-oriented. 
1	"After reading the book, I personally feel that the literati in the early Song Dynasty used intellectuals such as Fan Zhongyan as their models, and Su Shi did the same. Literati in the Song Dynasty were known for worrying about the country and the people. For example, Fan Zhongyan, Wang Anshi, Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang (including Su Shi), etc., if they can dig deep into their poems such positive information, form a kind of political star climate ""to the king, Yao and Shun,"" that is to say, the cluster effect. I think this has a very good appeal and appeal to the contemporary literati circle and even the corrupt atmosphere. "
0	I read it hastily. It’s too common. It’s just the same as the last one. There are many prints and many sales. I don’t know why it is so popular. Although the publisher plus the hype of XX does not prevent it from becoming a book. The fast food book and commentary, it is the last 
0	The story feels abrupt, and the protagonist suddenly died? I think there should be some other plots, and the heroine is too...what is the heroine? (Except for plump??? The author always describes this...) 
0	The book is used as a gift for my baby son, but after I ordered it for six days, I saw it, and my mood became worse. 
1	The hotel is OK, there are computers and digital TV in the room. Breakfast is average. The sound insulation effect is relatively poor, and the commercial street below is not very quiet. 
1	For a small holiday on May 1, staying at Huzhou International Hotel, I feel good, and the price/performance ratio is quite high, especially in the most lively shopping area in Huzhou, you can enjoy the festive way of the citizens during the May Day holiday in a small city, or you can choose calmly Huzhou’s specialty silk and brushes, because the specialty store is next door to the hotel. I often visit the green mountains and green waters. This time I came for pure shopping, which is not interesting. The service of the hotel is also good. Next time there is a need will stay. 
0	It’s been a long time, but I still can’t think of it 
1	I really like this paragraph, it's very well written! It is different from the previous description. Looking at the text is like a scene by the scenes before my eyes, slumbering freehand in front of Xiaoli, secretly looking at the candied haws want to eat, wearing a long coat of Ayan with a strange freehand look, wearing a down jacket The freehand brushwork with a soft hairy hair is all A Yan's freehand brushwork, all the freehand brushwork in his heart and eyes, and the freehand brushwork in his pupils. Following A Yan's freehand brushwork obsessively, what she didn't know was that while she was clinging to Xiaoli ignorantly, she was diverting into A Yan's blood vessels and flowing along the blood vessels into his heart. 
0	Very disappointed, it’s all pictures, a few words to explain wisdom books and comprehensive books. Children will be distracted after reading it. Picture printing is generally not cheap and not worth it. 
1	I have lived three times in two months, of course, the traffic is very convenient. 
0	My phone speaker sounds harsh, like a mobile phone speaker. I don’t know how others are doing. . . The plastic feel of the camera has been touched and dirty. Material problem? 
1	The white piano paint is very beautiful and the sound effect is great. For surfing the Internet, doing some text office, watching movies, as long as it is not a super blockbuster, the key is the convenience. The battery used 5 and a half hours in continuous office 
0	Fingerprints can be tolerated, but I don’t think the keyboard is very sturdy, and it’s slapped on it, and the screen light is a bit tired after a long time. 
0	The room environment is acceptable, the hygiene is worrying, and the sheets are stained! There are harassing calls. Additional comment April 6, 2008: There is no light in the parking lot, and sewage is left on the ground. It is recommended to cancel the shop 
1	Because of the convenience of work, traffic is a big consideration for frequent trips to and from this hotel. But now Tongbao Bus and Yongdong Bus do not run to this hotel, and there is less convenience. Checking in two days ago, the front desk noticed that it happened to be my birthday, and specially arranged a cake as a gift, which was very heartwarming. 
0	The picture is too messy, I don’t understand the key points. It’s hard to get the child to concentrate when telling a story. 
0	The service at the front desk was very poor. On October 1st, Manager Xu, the on-duty manager, deliberately deceived me from a standard room of 220 yuan a night into a business room for 380 yuan. Fortunately, Ctrip's customer service called me to confirm that I was not fooled. 
0	A super disgusting hotel. After I checked in, I found that there was dust everywhere on the desk and the windowsill. It was very disgusting. I only cleaned it after complaining to the reception! The service is very poor, the room is also very bad, there is a peculiar smell after entering, and the bed is very uncomfortable, I feel that the sheets are not clean, I personally feel that it is not enough for the stars! It's disgusting. In such a shabby place, there are people making harassment calls at night, asking if they want service, what kind of shabby place! Breakfast is also very disgusting, there is nothing to eat at all! ! 
1	"There was already a signed edition, but I bought another one on the spot. Li Qingzhao’s poem gives people a lot of emotion, ""Life should be a master, death is also a ghost, and I still think about Xiang Yu, and refuse to cross Jiangdong."" The heroes have always been heroes-not by success or failure-heroes sing more, especially losers, People gave more sympathy and pen and ink, as if they could feel the sadness of Farewell beset on all sides. Success is often difficult to replicate, but failure is always a lesson for us. Great things are great, little things are little. If there is nothing to learn from, it is still ridiculous. "
0	After reading the previous reviews, I feel that this hotel should be good, so this time I went to Cixi and booked the Guomai Hotel. The result was disappointing. The location of the hotel is good, the view from the window of the 298 double bed room is good, the park, the side street... Dissatisfied places: 1. The room is too dirty, the carpet must have not been washed for two years, stains all over the floor, if it is paved like a walkway On the contrary, the marble is much cleaner; the chair back and bed back are not clean, and there is a big fly in the room; 2. The shower head for bathing is very unusable; 3. The light in the lobby is too dim and dizzy! 4. The attitude of the waitress at the front desk is rather blunt; 5. All the business single beds in the hotel are located to the north. But the lower part is the cooling tower and the kitchen flue. It is noisy 
1	The screen is very bright and the keyboard is quite comfortable. It does not feel particularly small. The battery seems to last about 3 hours. 
1	Buying it for a friend, she hesitated for seven or eight days, and finally made up her mind on the 18th, 3299, used a coupon of 2000-100, won 3199, and it was out of stock on the afternoon of the 19th. Very good price, early 3000 , DVD burning, video head, high-definition interface, wireless method is picky, and also three years of warranty, to help people to the end, spent an afternoon installing xp, it feels very fast to run, the drive is not as difficult as everyone said It is recommended that friends who are still vacillating, if they are in stock, grab them quickly. 
0	It feels that the sound is louder when recording, and it is troublesome when working on the system. Hope to provide the corresponding driver or something, the people who want to install it can not find the place to download. 
1	The overall performance is still good. It would be fine if the DDR is the third generation, and there is memory. By the way, where can the memory be upgraded, I want to upgrade to the fourth generation. 
0	ctrip is marked with four stars, but it can only be described as gold and jade on the outside, but on the inside. This hotel is only good-looking, and the interior is at most tied with cheap hotels like Home or 7 days. I have stayed in all star hotels, that is This is the least that meets the 4-star standard. If the North Garden in Beijing and the Huaxia Hotel in Guangzhou are used as the standard 4-star reference, he is no different from the small hotel on the street in my eyes. I really don't know his four. Where does the star come from, the attitude at the front desk is poor, even the most basic smiley face is not available, the restaurant on the 3rd floor of the hotel is even worse, and there are few dishes in the menu. It's chopped, or don't come to eat, the taste of the dishes is even less complimented, I went out to find the hotel immediately after staying in the hotel for the first time, the location of Ziguang is not very good, even the beach can not be directly entered, it is recommended When I went to stay at the Southern Holiday Hotel in Yangjiang, the service attitude was much better, and I could go directly to the beach in front of the mountain, facing the sea, and the real sea view room! Or I stayed at Xiaogangwan Villa the next day, which is on the cliff side. In the evening, you can listen to the sea and drink tea in the small pavilion. Not far from the hotel, there is a Mong Kok seafood stall. Except for the sea prawns, the others are much cheaper than the outside. Fish, shrimp and crabs are just called! Both are The real sea view room is also very compatible with the standard three stars. The point is that these two three stars are much better than the 4 four stars, so it is recommended that you do not stay in the so-called Yangjiang's best and most advanced 4 star Zijiang, and spend money to buy it. Accept! 
0	I don’t know why so many people like it. I can’t move at all. What acupuncture points, acupuncture and moxibustion, are too far away from me. People who know medicine may understand better. Where are the second-hand books sold on Taobao? I don’t know where they can be sold. ? I didn't turn a few pages at all, it was as new as when I bought it. 
0	The model can only be used with Vista to display the card. If you use XP, the card will not be released. For example, only the integrated card is used. Vista’s system is very large. Occupying more than 10G, the whole system is very slow and very difficult. We are looking forward to launching XP card soon. 
0	The beginning of the book is self-praising and mutual praise, the author is not true. All the books are clicked, which is actually boring. If you haven't bought it, it is not recommended to buy it. You can read Wang Changsong's health book and Ma Yueling's several books. They are better than this one. I have read them before comparing them. I hope everyone will not be confused by the flattery. 
1	The configuration of the machine is good. The man in front was wrong, but there is no camera and the microphone still seems to be there. To be honest, the energy consumption and heat dissipation of the puma platform must continue to be controlled. When the system is installed in the air-conditioned room for a while on the weekend, it will be too hot. It is estimated that you can bake eggs. 
1	Nice hotel, good location, just out of the train station. The first floor is a bit noisy, there are tour groups and guests for dinner, but it does not affect the accommodation 
1	Although this hotel is a bit away from the city center, the scenery and services are particularly good. The hotel has complete facilities and is within walking distance to the sea. The hotel can also contact the driver for you and deliver breakfast to your room in advance at no extra charge. The hotel's dining tastes can basically meet various requirements. Next time you come to Weihai, I will stay in this hotel. 
1	The BIOS settings are very good! In order to facilitate the user to replace the new system, the BIOS is set to erase all the contents of the hard disk with one click! It is convenient for people who do not use the random system to replace the new system! 
1	"I got acquainted with Xiao Wu, starting from ""Freedom for the Child"", I was fascinated by her at once, and when I saw her new book, I bought it without hesitation. Maybe there are too many things to read about her, and this book did not touch me as much as before. But it is still consistent that Xiao Wu is still a Xiao Wu, still so smart and determined. Since accepting Xiao Wu for the first time, she has been out of control since then. She has been working hard to be a mother like her, but she has been working hard, only she knows, buying her books from time to time, seeking understanding and comfort. Probably the first book for the parents of Jackie Chan is Xiao Wu's book! "
0	It’s a little troublesome to install the system, but it’s easy to have an external CD-ROM drive. If you don’t have it, you have to be a little bit technical, but now the U-port drive system is not very troublesome. 
0	It seems a bit stained when I bought it, I hope it’s not a rework machine, the xp authorization code paper feels very old, and the body is a bit heavy 
0	Because the company’s reimbursement system is strict, I asked the front desk to stamp the hotel seal on the printed statement when checking out the hotel (does you say this request is excessive), but the front desk lady refused to stamp it for various reasons. If you can't reimburse the expenses when you go back on a business trip, who would dare to stay in such a hotel? If you are not in a hurry to catch a plane, you must find a hotel for an explanation! It is recommended that friends with strict reimbursement systems should not consider this hotel. 
1	The laptop with the same configuration has the lowest price, good running speed, and abundant laptop interfaces. It is enough to replace my desktop. 
1	I didn't expect this place in Kaifeng to have a hotel with such a good service. The training of hotel staff is in place. The service is about the same as some five-star hotels I have experienced. It turned out to be the team of the Municipal Party Committee Guest House. The downside is which room we stayed in, the facilities are a bit outdated. The traffic is very convenient. It takes 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the most prosperous Kaifeng snack street. 
1	This time I went to Hong Kong on the day when the black rainstorm warning was issued. I wanted to cancel it. However, I called Ctrip and wanted to cancel. After communicating with the hotel, Ctrip said it was not possible, so I had to go in the rain. It turned out that there was no rain in our activity area. When I went there, I told the front desk of the hotel that the number of floors should be high, but the 27th floor was arranged. I was worried that it was in the middle of the residential building. I was satisfied with the result. I could see far away and it was an executive suite. The bathroom is really not surprisingly small, but it is clean and tidy. The traffic is quite convenient, very close to the subway station, the key is to figure out how to walk the trail. I am satisfied with the hotel as a whole and will consider staying again next time. However, Ctrip's efficiency was too low in the subsequent confirmation stage. From the complaint about the order status error to the final confirmation, two weeks have passed. 
1	Not worth the price, breakfast is too bad, maybe I went late, around nine o'clock, there was nothing to eat 
1	"This book is very good, no matter from the conception of the story, or the way of expression, it all shows the author's extraordinary literary skills, and the two poignant love stories are fully interpreted! At first I saw it because I wanted to understand the life of the Hui people, but I was attracted by the plot. For the first time in my life, I had a strong desire to read a book ""I can't help but want to read it."" In fact, I did often because of this. I didn't know it until the morning one or two days...Although sometimes I feel sleepy the next day, but I feel very at ease and gratified! I strongly recommend everyone to read this book! "
0	The room is old and the wallpaper has mildew. The environment is average, not as antique as the one introduced on Ctrip, but rather dilapidated. However, the surrounding traffic is more convenient, very close to the scenic spots and the bus station. 
1	Nice hotel, breakfast is also ok, and if you book with Ctrip, there will be gifts and greetings. The newly decorated hotel is all good, and there are rose petals in the toilet. . Ha ha ha ha 
0	The 2g vista is still a bit difficult. The metal frame inside the back cover is indeed a bit like a refurbished one. 
0	The location is quite remote, coming out of the fifth ring at night, there is no street light at the first turn, the room is small, the rooms on the second floor have to go down from the third floor, I didn't realize what services they can provide, even taxi Given. Definitely not recommended to stay. 
0	Now the express delivery (wallaby) is too rubbish, not delivered to the door, but also let downstairs to pick it up, is this express delivery? If you buy major appliances or the like, it will be terrible at the top. 
0	The memory is a bit small, but if you add more than 200, you can add 2G, which is usually enough. The original battery is less durable, and the power can be expanded by purchasing a 9-cell battery. 
0	A bit heavy. The graphics card is not independent, it is a set display. If you are playing large-scale online games, it is recommended to buy a separate display. 
1	Good price-performance ratio, comprehensive functions, and no highlights~~~~Wow haha~~~~~~ The service is also in place, just 1 day, not bad, very convenient, it saves me running around and being fooled~~~~~ 
0	"The big words on it read: Are you giving away a beautifully signed poster with the book? ? ? Why did you only receive the book without the poster""? ? ? ? ? Return my poster! ! ! "
1	What impresses me most about this book is its practicality, and the quality of the book is exactly the same as the original book sold in the bookstore, so I am very grateful to Dangdang, the book buying platform. The words in it are classified to memorize, and each word The appearance of the word will be accompanied by its synonyms and antonyms, so it will be much easier to remember, and each word will have a matching sentence to match the memory, a very good book! The CD-ROM paid for the book is used for synchronization on the computer, so you can steal the boss's time jacket without flipping the book during working hours! 
1	The overall feeling is good, the genuine VISTA system is installed, the appearance is beautiful, the screen is clear, and it also comes with a cooling base and anti-virus software, and the price is relatively high! 
1	This book is worth the price. Personally feel very satisfied, the appearance is beautiful, the hand feels very good! 
0	I just read it, and I think it's very general, and I didn't introduce any valuable workplace rules. It can only be said that a very general book is made entirely by speculation. 
0	"The biggest disadvantage of this machine is that ""CPU heat is not copper, and other metals used to cut corners."" Even if the AMD upgrade program is installed, the CPU temperature is often above 70 degrees, and sometimes it is 85 degrees, or even 89 degrees. , The back is hotter even without a large game "
1	"One of the two best surviving rubbings of ""Cao Quanbei"". Can be plundered by the Japanese, the original is now in Japan. It is the rare ancient book that I have longed for. This version is well preserved, with a postscript by Wu Changshuo. Good books are good stickers. Attention needs to be paid during temporary study: some characters were created when the soil has not been cleared, like the word ""国"" in the first line of Cao Guo. From the perspective of the extension, it can distinguish the handwriting formed by the soil in the word after absorbing ink. The same goes for the left side. In addition, the thin strokes of some characters are also related to the degree of soil residue in the characters. It is really not easy for the Cultural Relics Publishing House to publish this copybook. It is worth collecting and learning. "
0	No anti-virus software is given, only 60 days of use. The price is high. In some places, 2900. Because it is anxious to use, it is convenient to place an order. It may be due to the battery, the machine is a bit heavy. Really fight fingerprints. 
1	I just bought it on May 1st, and the driver is foolish. I can get it all at once, but because I didn’t pay attention, I installed a lot of useless software. 
1	For some reason, I have been trying to comment on the Tai'an Overseas Chinese Building, but have been unsuccessful. Because the hotel's service is very good. Some time ago, I went to Tai'an to climb Mount Tai with my colleagues. We set off at 12 o'clock in the evening. The waiter at the front desk told us that the temperature in the mountains was low, so let us add more clothes. Very careful. Because I checked out early in the morning, I was in a hurry, and my wallet fell under the bed. When we were approaching the foot of the mountain, the hotel staff called us and said that we had found our wallet. We found out that the wallet was lost. Back to the hotel immediately, remember that the person on duty was Su Xiu, we would like to express our gratitude. Thank you! Hotel feedback on June 1, 2008: Our hotel is a veteran four-star hotel with high-quality staff, and each of them has more than ten years of service experience. The number of guest services is second to none in Thailand. Guests choose our hotel. Live in a warm, safe, and at ease. 
0	This book is divided into three parts: easy, middle and difficult, covering a wide range of content. But not detailed enough, each unit has only two dialogues and one part of new words. The CD-ROM has been cracked when the goods are delivered and cannot be used. I don't know if I can find the download on the Internet? 
0	It took 2 days to ship the goods and no one contacted me or I took the initiative to contact the customer service. The customer service always responded. I chose the credit card payment and the cash payment was very unsatisfactory. 
0	Service attitude is not good, very poor, bad attitude at the front desk, unclean rooms, framed guests as perpetrators, requesting compensation from guests 
0	I bought this book because I read everyone's reviews, but after I bought it and read dozens of pages, I found it to be too simple. Although the author has her reason, I believe she has not done all the content in it... I don’t feel anything, nor the feeling that attracts me to read...It's probably suitable for junior high school students. People who don't have high requirements for reading quality can just flip it... 
1	Nice hotel, good location, just out of the train station. The first floor is a bit noisy, there are tour groups and guests for dinner, but it does not affect the accommodation 
1	I read the comments of all the netizens before I checked in. I didn't expect very much, and I prepared slippers and drinking water. When I checked in, I asked for a non-smoking room. After moving in, I found that the room is quite large. Although the basic facilities are not new but the functions are intact, the soundproofing of the room (I live on the 3rd floor) is also good. The overall feeling is okay. 
1	Cheap, nothing to say, more than 4k, much cheaper than thinkpad, although more expensive than Shenzhou and the like, but you get what you pay for, the quality is still passable, and it is a good choice for the poor and stingy bosses. . 
1	Good.. My friend accompanied me to pick up the goods. As soon as I saw the phone, my friend said that the color was beautiful. But I think the outer shell is a bit earthy. But the inside feels a bit gradual. The keyboard feels very good! 
0	There is a provincial road on the back of the hotel, the traffic is convenient, the parking lot is very large and convenient, but the sound of passing cars is very loud at night, especially in the middle of the night, and the sound of tractors appears once every 15 minutes on average, which affects rest. It is recommended that friends who stay in this hotel must be Choose a room on the south side, so you can stay away from noise. 
1	Moreover, this is not a book to be thrown away after reading. Every time you read it, you will have a whole new feeling. In particular, there is a simple comment at the end of each story, and children will understand better when they read it. The only flaw is that there are stories in the book that we have read in other magazines before. Of course, this is definitely not too short. 
1	Older restaurant, the room can only be described as being relatively clean and tidy, but it is a bit far from the five-star. The bathroom is also very small. The things are relatively old. 
1	In fact, I’ve read the love story N times on the Internet, but I still can’t help but buy a paper book to collect it. I really like the story about love story. Gu Zhengrong fits our imagination of love very much. Affectionate, gentle male protagonist is everybody Girls want it, not surprisingly, I also like Gu Zhengrong very much. As for Ling Xiaomeng, he is very cute, like a little ostrich. It is estimated that in this article, it is not that Gu Zhengrong was hospitalized. Xiaomeng will definitely continue to escape! Fortunately, Renhaida arranged for them such a beautiful and memorable ending. I like it very much and it is a book worth collecting. 
0	It is considered a good hotel in the local area, so every time I go to the local area on business, I will basically stay in this hotel. Hotel services are average, facilities are not ideal, it would be better if you can make targeted improvements. 
0	Vista basic is not good, there are too many pre-installed software, there are more than 60 processes, the top of the Esc key seems to be leaking, the panel is a bit hot, expensive but nothing is given 
0	1G memory is a bit smaller, plan to increase 1G after changing to xp, there are two pieces of hardware that can’t be recognized, I don’t know why 
1	Compared with the notebook with the same configuration, this price is real; the configuration is more reasonable. The functions are also practical. After getting started, directly change the XP system. After the burn-in software ran for a day, the machine was just warm, and the fan noise that made me most worried was almost inaudible. 
0	It was okay after a few days, but there is a bright spot! It was really maddening, a point was not covered by the warranty, and I didn't look at it when I received it! 
0	Why did the price decrease as soon as I bought it! I bought it at 3999. I look back at 3966. It’s a bit like buying stocks. 
1	"Good novels often don't have answers. From the beginning to the end, ""Medi"" has been tenaciously telling readers why. Naturally, this is not to say that it is too simple, not a good novel, or not up to the strict standards of pure literature. In fact, a lot of puzzles are said or not, discussed or discussed, and the results are the same. If there is an answer, there is no answer. No answer is exactly the answer. Literature cannot solve any practical problems. It is not a textbook. Art is a reflection of reality. Before choosing a mate, it is obviously not a bad thing for urban men and women to take a look at this book. "
0	How do you look at the story after a period of time is not over yet, and other things are said, then the previous story is followed. Sometimes it makes me mess up, and it depends on what was said in the previous paragraph before I continue. Is the printing wrong? 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the keyboard is also very comfortable, the main reason is that it is cost-effective, and the 5099 is very cost-effective! 
0	It is more troublesome for me to install the system! Moreover, my technique is also relatively good! Buyers with good levels can leave some experience! Ha ha 
0	There is no heating in the middle of the night, how can I live????!!!!!!!!!! 
1	The appearance is quite satisfactory, the graphics card is good, and the overall performance is okay. I bought it for the NBA version. Insufficient: I don’t know how to dissipate it for a long time. I haven’t used it for a long time. The attached CD does not have an XP driver, so it is troublesome to download it yourself. Summary: The first time I bought a notebook on JD.com, shopping was quite pleasant. If the Lenovo sports backpack you send is also an NBA commemorative version, it will be perfect 
0	It’s okay to talk online as a personal experience, but it’s a bit too much to publish the book, and there are some obvious fallacies in the book. But the writing style is not bad, I suggest writing prose. 
0	When I arrived at the hotel, the defendant told me that the reserved room was sold for the hourly room. I waited for more than half an hour before moving in. The room was small and the air was not good. That night my wife came for an official holiday and soiled the sheets. The hotel asked me to pay 300 yuan (room charge) 260 yuan), I understood that I entered the black shop and the hotel had a strong attitude. Later, after communicating with Ctrip and the hotel, they said that the cost price of the item could be reduced to 200 yuan. I still couldn’t accept it. Then I contacted Ctrip and said it was a hotel regulation. There was nothing I could do. Later, the front desk actually charged me the long-distance fee for calling Ctrip. It was 12 yuan for 6 minutes. I expressed a strong protest and the hotel stopped. The above process took us 1 hour in total. I really can’t afford to pay for the time. Money left, but I still hope ctrip can give a reasonable explanation 
0	The order stated that the book has been sent to me, but it was found that it was not delivered when the book was delivered. What's the matter? I really want this book, why not give it away 
1	The hotel is well-equipped in all aspects, and the service is also good, but the location is relatively biased. Far from the city center. 
1	"Many years ago, I visited Spencer. Dr. Johnson ""Precious Gift."" It was this book that led me into his story world. From then on I will collect his works. He never tells the truth bluntly, but uses vivid stories to let the readers become the protagonists in the book. The book ""Why lucky people are always lucky"" permeates deep truths in the dialogue between young people and various successful people. Sometimes it is a little too theoretical, but every important and enlightening experience is added by young people. It is marked out and also marked separately in the layout of this book. It is a good book worth promoting. "
1	The location of the hotel is very good, suitable for travel and vacation! The rooms are so-so, have been there! Service is average! 
0	It seems that it is not suitable for the northern language habits, and the words and characters are awkwardly matched. So it was very tiring to read. The hope of reading the previous newspaper is too great, so the greater the disappointment. In short, I don't like it anymore. 
1	Configuration is fierce! fair price. The display effect is good. Not too heavy. Rich interfaces. If it is lighter, it is a perfect machine! 
0	The printing of the book is great. It’s a pity that the text is too rare, and it feels a bit like a Korean TV series. It’s too flashy and doesn’t like the Korean style. It has no connotation and has no effect on memory. I suggest not to buy 
1	Very good hotel, booked for our distinguished customers, staying on the executive floor on weekends, floor-to-ceiling windows on the 28th floor, the south-facing room has a good view, overlooking the elevated Yan'an West Road. Because it is the top floor, the elevated sound insulation is also very good! The hardware facilities are very good and meet the four-star standard! The fly in the ointment is that the rooms on the executive floor are a bit cramped and the space is slightly insufficient! In addition, there is another point that the sound insulation is not very good. Our customers have severe insomnia and are often awakened by the sound of footsteps and noise outside the door! Room for improvement! In short, it is highly recommended to stay! 
1	This book was recommended by a friend and I personally think it is worth reading. In the book, the author expounded his comprehensive understanding of Buddhism, Taoism and Christianity, and I think it is quite in-depth. To be honest, I don't really understand what the author said. But I feel that if people can really face life like the heroine Rui Xiaodan, it will not be easy. After reading the book, I immediately found the TV series on the Internet and watched it. The TV series were not well filmed, and seemed to be endorsing, without performing in-depth performances of the heroes and heroines. It may be written too well. 
1	Jingdong’s dd delivery speed is amazing, it arrived at noon the next day, with the invoice, you can also pull the card, 8 wrong. Open the XP CD, but there is no pre-installed office 
0	The edges around the screen are a bit loose. Continue to use, the machine is still a little hot. The buttons under the touchpad feel bad. Side A is prone to fingerprints and needs to be wiped frequently. The carrying weight is still relatively large, of course, it has nothing to do with the large-capacity battery. 
1	The top cover is made of magnesium-aluminum alloy, the blue-black spray paint looks simple and elegant, the overall shape is quite stable and square, and the blue and black combination is quite stable. 
0	Service attitude-without attitude, it doesn't matter whether it is good or bad. The receptionist is watching people-using eyes to white the doorman-what the doorman looks like, I have never seen the room-the lock is broken hotel description-even the Chinese is wrong (Chaozhou in Zhejiang) , Not to mention the introduction in English, oh, the English translation of the hotel description itself misspelled breakfast. After eating, I found something outside to eat. Room price: 390/night, deposit 800? ? ! ! 
0	I bought back this bestseller with joy, but before I finished reading it, the back cover of the book almost fell off. Based on my many years of experience in buying books, from the perspective of the paper, printing quality, packaging and content of the book, there are reasons to believe that I bought a photocopy. 
1	The location is good, the transportation is convenient, the hotel services and facilities are good, it is considered a good hotel in Zhengzhou, and I have the opportunity to go to Zhengzhou to live in Yuda in the future. 
1	What makes our little Judy have the identity of an orphan and can still live so happily? He is the sponsor of the orphanage, who has never met before---Long-legged uncle, or she is a character herself Cheerful, optimistic and strong girl. After reading this book, we seem to be growing up with her, growing up with her, sharing joy with her, and sharing sorrow with her. The tone of this book is healthy and upward. Parents who recommend us can safely show to girls who are growing up (10-18 years old). Let each of us learn how to love, how to communicate with others, and learn to be grateful. 
0	This is the third time I have stayed at Senhua Garden. The hotel was estimated to be oversold on the 9/17 order (two double bed rooms). When I checked in, I was told that I had not received an order from Ctrip, so I had to order 178 per room. Stay in 2 big bed rooms. 1. The hotel handled the matter in a way that the committee was responsible, which made me lose confidence in Senhuayuan! , In fact, even if I admit to overselling, I can still accept it, even if it is to increase money. 2. The cleanliness of the bathroom is really terrible! Everyone who stayed at the apartment hotel wanted cheap price, convenience, cleanliness and comfort, but there was a problem with cleanliness, which made me sure that Senhua Garden will be completely excluded from consideration in the future. 3. It is estimated that the business is too good! So these conditions have occurred! Then! I suggest that you let its business go down for a while, maybe it will help the hotel adjust itself, I believe it is not a bad thing for the hotel or our customers! 
0	I encountered this treatment the first time I bought a book. I called back and forth, sent emails, and sent back packages. I didn't want to reimburse me for the postage!! I was really disappointed in Dangdang! 
0	Stayed here for 9 nights this time...the room is big...but there are mosquitoes...the soundproofing is too bad...asked to the counter if you can get an electric mosquito coil...the hotel counter actually said no (actually there are The counter clerk was too lazy.... After that, I changed my room to another room.. After staying for 2 days, I was bitten by a flea in the room with 14-15 buds on my thigh... I was bitten by a flea... the staff at the counter didn’t say anything... it’s really damning!! I had to call the hotel manager afterwards to deal with it... stayed for 9 nights...because I came to Shanghai for a business trip for 18 days ...After that, I changed to another hotel~~ After the checkout... because my card (not a domestic card) needs to call the bank for confirmation... the counter manager actually asked me to call back to Taiwan by myself...service The quality and hygiene of the room are really terrible... Supplementary comment October 25, 2007: 罴ぇ...┬Ding Jiao ネび畉...狝 婨キび, τ 穨ぃ pound, 搂华ぃ,筁 Ding... 皊┍!! 
0	After using it for a week, there was a problem with the hardware, the blue screen suddenly appeared, and the error was that the hard disk could not be recognized. Garbage machine. I don't know if it is DELL's problem or Jingdong's problem. But after-sales service is ok, full refund. 
0	The graphics card driver is not easy to install. Finally got it done. I installed VISTA Ultimate SP1. 
1	"What a confused rabbit. I don’t know who I am. I really like his confused look. I keep asking, ""Am I a monkey?"" ""Am I a porcupine?"" ""Am I a badger?"" ""Should I live in a cave?"" ""Should I live in a bird's nest?"" ""Should I live on a spider web?"" ""Do I want fish?"" ""... But such a confused rabbit did not hesitate in the face of danger, flew his big feet, kicked it hard, oh, the rabbit became a hero! "
1	The price-performance ratio is good, but the speed of the goods from the warehouse to the pick-up point is too slow. The order I placed on June 5th did not reach the pick-up point until the 8th. 
1	Convenient transportation, it is the best choice to go to Nanjing Pedestrian Street. However, the restaurant's business hours (especially the Chinese restaurant) are a bit inconvenient. There is no lunch until 2:30 noon. You know, this Chinese food is a little famous. 
0	The vista system that comes with it is too slow. I added 2 gigabytes of memory. The total 4 gigabytes of memory is not as fast as my broken desktop 3 years ago. There is no driver under XP, so it will be very troublesome if you install xp yourself. , Graphics and sound cards are difficult to handle. In short, the system that comes with is too rubbish, so it’s hard to get XP by yourself. 
1	A very good book, worth buying! I bought it specifically for my baby. He is 2 years old and likes reading books. I read almost all the well-known picture books, and I remember very clearly. Picture books are really attractive. The things they show are very profound and beyond the reach of language. When a child is very young, maybe some things will be listened to in our language. He doesn’t understand, but through these things The works of artistic and literary value can be felt by him. Moreover, even adults can feel very profound things from it, which is worthy of being a masterpiece! 
1	The environment is great and it feels very safe to live. I live in Room 28204 of the main building. The attitude of the room service staff, the front desk lady and the doorman are very good. The disadvantage is that the breakfast is average. Sometimes the service staff in the breakfast department sits down and eats after the guests have not finished eating, which needs improvement. In addition, it takes time to wait, because the courtyard is really deep, suitable for friends with cars. 
1	I stayed in a business suite. Although it was not as big as the 72 square meters written on the co-process, the layout and decoration of 52 square meters were very satisfactory. There are also free soft drinks and free laundry (within a certain amount) in the suite, so it is still good value for money. Although the place is not close to the sea, I can see the sea on the 32nd floor, and it is not far from Yunxiao Road, Qingdao's most famous food street, so although it is not as casual as a seaside resort, the location is quite good. 
0	Can't install the network card driver! ! Which hero knows how to install the network card driver? ? Download from the official website, no network card driver! ! very dizzy! 
1	"【Recommendation】I have never had a book that can give me such a great feeling, even if I first read ""Meeting Yourself Who I Want to Do Everything"". When work and the surrounding environment change, everything is back to the starting point, when you and your friends around you are no longer in the same horizontal line, and so on, all changes, when we come back to us who have never been confident, we need to understand and accept , But at the same time, we need to know what we want, remember to be firm, and to wait. Slowly, great changes will take place in our own lives. "
1	It is very convenient to stay in the city center, next to the park and the river, the view is good, and it is a quiet place to take away from the noisy! The room is stylish, the most impressive thing is the bed, it is so comfortable that I fell asleep when I lay on it , Dinner is a Western-style buffet. In the night, the glass curtain tops the lights with a little bit of light like stars, romantic like a wild meal, it is a kind of enjoyment... Hey, I personally think it is more petty. There are many nearby. Special restaurants, you can go on foot, it is very convenient! 
0	I bought a set for my 6-year-old daughter, as well as the latest seventh volume. She liked it very much. She had read the book from other students in the kindergarten, but she still hugged it when she got home. It seemed really good. I am going to buy another set for my friend’s child 
0	Out of a good impression of the HNA system, although the conditions are not outstanding, the breakfast is simple, (you can choose Baohua Hotel, Conifer Crown Hotel and many other hotels with better conditions for the same price), but I will stay for the second time, and book in advance. The room type (deluxe business big bed room), the price is also the same; but when you check in (to the hotel later), the room type is different (more simple). The phone negotiated with the front desk, saying that these are all luxury business double rooms, and the prices are the same. (I don't know how to customize the hotel) I asked for the same room type as the last time I stayed, and told me that there is no room, but I was rejected. Halo... Another: Ctrip booked this hotel room price is too expensive, direct check-in at the front desk is only 340 yuan, but Ctrip price is 378 yuan. I wonder how Ctrip can ensure that the price announced online is the most affordable price as advertised? Next time, I should not choose here again. 
0	1. The room has a heavier decoration smell! 2. Poor sound insulation 3. The reservation content cannot be guaranteed. The double bed room I booked became a double bed room! 
0	Hotel conditions are very poor! Obviously, there is a network, but I can’t use it! And there are piles of cockroaches, I will never choose this hotel! ! ! Additional comments July 20, 2007: Very bad! ! ! ! 
0	Due to intel's policy restrictions, CPU performance is too poor! The battery is too small! The power cord is too thick and only consumes tens of W. Thin wires can be used, which adds weight for no reason! The hard disk has only one zone, BC! No system recovery CD! The keyboard will sink and deform when typing a little harder, so I feel a little scared! 
0	I bought this book yesterday, and when I received it, I started to engage in activities to send memory and hard disk....I can’t help it after the order is completed... I feel a bit unkind. 
1	In general, this book is of good quality and good content. It can broaden everyone's horizons. The delivery speed is also very fast-only 3 days! Disadvantages: There is no comment on some of the more difficult words (some words are not available in general dictionaries). There are individual spelling errors, although the book has shortcomings. However, I think this book is worth reading! Since I have just read this book, I cannot fully grasp the whole situation of this book for the time being. In the process of reading this book in the future, I will communicate with you on its advantages and disadvantages in time! 
0	Rarely come up to comment, but in order to let everyone have a correct understanding, I would like to take a moment to comment: My suggestion is to ask you to choose another hotel, because this hotel is relatively old, and the most important thing is the soundproofing effect of the room Poor, I am very uncomfortable. Of course, if you don’t care about noise, this hotel is still ok. 
0	1. The breakfast is very poor. 2. The service attitude is very poor. 3. The location is not good. There is nothing to eat around. Overall, it's very poor. I checked in on April 28, 2008. 
1	Sex education has always been something I want to tell my daughter but I don't know how to talk about it. When I saw this set of books online, I was very happy, and immediately decided to buy it. At first I wanted to set up two volumes, but the first volume was out of stock. I bought the second volume first. My daughter was seven years old and was very interested. I read it several times. After buying the first volume, my daughter found the second volume again, and read the upper and lower volumes several times. In the next period of time, my daughter would often find out these two books and flip through them, discussing some related issues with her mother. Very good book. 
0	The location is not good, it's almost at the top of Minzu Road, too far, there is no place to eat or go shopping around. The hotel room is small and the bed is too small. The breakfast is terrible, except for cold dishes and pickles, there are basically no hot dishes. Moreover, the meal has to be withdrawn just after 8:30. 
0	It is very troublesome to install the XP system, the driver is hard to find, incomplete, hard to install, and the screen brightness is not easy to adjust. Virtual scroll is not installed. 
1	This is a very good version of the Sixth Ancestor Altar Sutra. I bought another Altar Sutra before, but the explanation inside is regrettable. Readers who know very little about the altar scripture will misread the text if they have read the author's inappropriate interpretation of the text. And this altar sutra that Ming Zang talked about has dug up many places that I read the original text and missed the mistakes, which can be said to have benefited. Although, the recommendation is to read the original as much as possible. Don't look at today's explanation. However, this Ben Ming Zang's explanation is worth seeing. It helps to read the altar sutra correctly. 
1	"Like Zhang Xiaoxian, Zhang Manjuan's words belong to the healing department. Although I am not injured, it does not affect my love for her. She loves the ""Legend"" volume in ""A Hundred Years of Love"". The legend originally seemed dark and full of resentment, but she was gentle and authentic to feel the joys, sorrows and sorrows of the beautiful women in the long history. Alas, she is calm and calm, she loves her as careful as dust, loves her as gentle as water. Love her. "
1	The hotel is very close to the long-distance bus station, which is only a 5-minute walk away. The overall environment is good and the rooms are very clean. I stayed in a standard room. As a three-star hotel, I feel good. The service attitude is very satisfactory. Walking along the road in front of the hotel is Mingsha Mountain. A taxi is 10 yuan, a bus is 1 yuan, and there is a stop in front of the hotel. It is said to be the most expensive hotel in Dunhuang. But I only stayed for one night and it didn't matter. 
1	I bought it for a friend, I haven’t seen it, but I think Acer won’t be as bad as the Chinese-made Great Wall notebook I bought. 
0	During the process of decompressing the system, there was no prompt for partitioning. After the release, I found that the C drive was actually 202G. It was very angry. In addition, Lenovo took up a few gigabytes of space and divided it into two areas. It seemed that it could not be moved easily. The Samsung memory stick in the gift is not in a sealed package, but there is no trace of use, and the installation is smooth 
0	The hotel is already in dilapidated condition, the corridors and rooms are full of moldy smell, the carpets are dirty, and the faucet on the sink is already active, which is extremely unusable. I originally booked a room for a week. I decided to change the hotel on the day of check-in. Because it was close to the office, I endured it for two days. On the third day, it was really unbearable. There were mosquitoes at night! Terrible! ! ! The electric mosquito coils provided by the hotel didn't work at all, so I had to change to a new hotel that was said to have not been opened for long. Although it was farther away, it was much cheaper than here and the facilities were too strong. It is strongly not recommended to stay at this hotel, otherwise you will regret it. 
0	I haven’t found it yet. Doesn’t it mean that there will be a coupon for delivery after shopping? Why haven’t I received the rebate after I’ve completed it? What’s the matter? I hope the customer service can help me answer it. Also, the package sent is a bit big, hehe ! But it's pretty. 
1	Read it once and there are 2 typos. It shouldn't be wrong. Hope to correct it when the reprint. 
0	This is the 5th time I have stayed at Yanming Lake Hotel in Changchun. There was a power outage last night. I fell asleep late at night. My wallet was entered into my room by an insider, who stole nearly 1,000 yuan and 4 credit cards from me. . . My ID, foreign currency, digital camera, etc. are all in the safe in the room, intact. I made long-distance calls for hours to deal with the freeze of my credit card. I filed a report. The security camera probe of this 4-star hotel is broken and has not been repaired! The security also checked the entry time of the room card, that is, no one else entered my room late at night. Wouldn't the insider use other clever ways to enter? My down jacket was also placed on the ground by this insider! I didn't think much when I woke up! It was almost noon that I realized that my wallet lacked cash and credit cards! Also, the attitude of this hotel is very bad! No sympathy! The 2,000 yuan I authorized before, I made an international call, and the bank said that the 2,000 yuan I used to enter the hotel two days ago was authorized, but the hotel’s finances did not appreciate it and said that the Bank of China did not authorize it. I made another international call and my bank said it was approved! This 4-star hotel is not responsible. I think it’s impossible. I filed a report. I will never stay with this less than 1-star service. It’s shameful! I also want to tell this incident to those who want to book this hotel. Why is the hotel power cut? The camera is so bad that it happens to let everyone know that this kind of insider behavior is a powerful blow. Okay, let's not talk about it! ! ! Thousands of dollars are lost. I am disgusted with the attitude of the hotel! I strongly tell everyone and remind others not to come to this hotel! 
0	The room is too small and the breakfast is too poor, I will never patronize it again. The Nanguo Hotel next door looks good. I want to eat in the restaurant of the hotel at night, but the family organizes a wedding banquet and refuses individual guests. I feel depressed! The advantage is that the location is good. The south-facing room can see the Fuchun River. Unfortunately, the so-called superior room for me is north-facing. No wonder people say that Ctrip customers are more discriminated against. 
0	The Asian Games Village had already been shown online, so I could mention it by myself, but I went there, but I haven't arrived yet. It took more than an hour for the truck to arrive. 
1	I have stayed in this hotel before, but it was still managed by HILTON at that time. Now it is NIKKO. It feels obviously not as good as before, and the facilities are somewhat outdated. However, in a five-star hotel in Dalian, the price of this hotel is relatively relatively Reasonable, there is a newly built fashionable living area near the hotel, there are some good restaurants and coffee shops, and the hotel's comprehensive services and management need to be strengthened. 
1	The service is good and the facilities are pretty good, but the soundproofing of the room is really bad. Hotel Feedback December 28, 2007: First of all, thank you very much for choosing Oriental Hotel, and thank you for your valuable suggestions. The hotel is currently building a western restaurant on the top of the building. There will be some noise in the early stage of construction. We have clear regulations on the construction time of the project, and construction is not allowed during normal rest periods; once again, I sincerely apologize to you, and the Oriental Hotel will welcome you again with a new image in the near future! 
0	The wine red color of the book is not as good-looking and dazzling as expected, there is no software, and you have to install it yourself, which is a bit troublesome, ha ha! In addition, after a while of testing, it was quite hot, and it seemed that the heat dissipation was not good! 
0	My son is now two weeks and nine months old, and he usually plays the egg laying game. This time I got the book, not only saw the egg laying game, but also the fishing game, etc., every day he caught me when he saw me Say, mom, let's go fishing outside together~ or? Mom, I lay a big egg, I have a big ass, haha, for you to eat, I am faint~? But from the heart Moved, son, I know how to entertain myself, and sometimes lead his friends to play games. Of course, he is the boss, hehe! 
0	I still look forward to Bi Shumin's works. But after reading this book, I feel a little disappointed. The words pile up a vague plot. The author has always emphasized her past medical experience between the lines, but she is obviously not professional enough. Professionals will laugh at this work, but amateurs will not find it attractive. No shore at both ends. In fact, readers are not interested in the author's experience. Just like Yi Shu's words, any work is a classic among classics. 
1	I lived in the IIA standard room of 298, in general it still looks like 4 stars, the room is big enough, the bathroom hot water is not bad, and all the facilities are standard. That is, the house is relatively old, and this price is not worth it if it is available during the peak season. The breakfast is not that bad, but the hotel has a lot of meetings, so you have to go early to catch up with the team or it will be all vegetable soup. The service is relatively standard and smooth in all aspects. If you are not familiar with Xining, it is safe to live there. The police and traffic police are always on duty at the door. It is a bit inconvenient to go to Zhengzhou now 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, just by the city center square, it is very convenient to travel, the room conditions are also good, I should stay again next time. 
0	It seems that the fan has a louder sound, and the power interface is behind the fuselage. I personally prefer it on the side. 
0	1. Only a small part of the rooms have internet access, which is not free, and an extra 15 yuan/day is required. 2. Poor hygiene, room carpets are very dirty, and there are black circle marks left by do not know what liquid is left. The utensils were not clean enough. They should have been white, but the color looked gray. There were many small holes on it. In addition, I saw cockroaches crawling over the table calmly... 
1	Losing weight is a very common thing, some people say it is a woman's career. I am 26 and I have been losing weight every year since I was almost 20 years old. I stored the fat for a winter and began to lose weight for a year in the spring. But the only real success was that I lost 10 pounds last year and felt very hard. Perseverance in the right way is not only a necessary condition for weight loss but also for success in anything. If it’s right, you should do things like losing weight. It shouldn’t be something you do every year in your life. If you do it, do it once. There is a belief that any miracle will happen. 
0	For the order placed at 4799, the price became 4699 when received, and an anti-virus CD was presented. Then, because of the newly added gifts, I could not apply for price protection. This is obviously a small method for Jingdong to evade price protection. Let me Very unhappy! 
1	The 3-person room is quite large, but the heating is not too warm, it is cold and hot. There will be oily areas on the sheets, but it is acceptable. There is no heating in the washroom and toilet, and the bath will be cold at first. 24-hour hot water, more attentive service, bucket drinking water is still good. The surrounding environment can be relatively quiet, west to Xizhimen, the zoo; north to Jishuitan, Xinjiekou gap; south to Xidan; east to Houhai is a relatively convenient location. The newly opened Xinhua Department Store in Gap is more stylish, and it's not bad to stroll around. Recommend to live! 
1	Stable, low noise, low heat, the screen looks comfortable, bright and not glaring, and feels very moist. The keyboard feels good too. 
1	1. This is the second time I bought this on JD.com within one month, the delivery speed is still very fast, and the delivery is within 24 hours, satisfactory. 2. The packaging of the machine is intact without damage, and the surface of the machine has no scratches. 3. The system installation was very smooth, the installation was completed in one hour without any problems. 4. The machine has good heat dissipation and runs quietly. 
1	Perhaps, one day, this book will give us a kind of strength, let us look back and see if our elderly father is also recalling the warmth of many years ago. 
1	I can't finish the game. This configuration is good for daily use, and the keyboard is more comfortable. It is more convenient to install the XP system. First, change the IDE and the CD drive to boot first, and then use the IBM AHCI driver to change back to AHCI. 
0	There is no table in the hotel room. The first time I encountered it, there were spiders. The room equipment was relatively old. 
1	"The location is good, because Weihai is small, it doesn't cost much to take a taxi to the city. I booked a sea view room. The sea view cannot be said to be beautiful, but there is a sunrise to watch. Moreover, at a small fishing port by the sea at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the people who fished more and returned home, not just a scene. The front desk service is average and polite, but lacks sincerity, which is the professional feeling of ""have to be polite to customers"". The service of HOUSEKEEPING staff is very good. Additional comments September 28, 2007: The breakfast buffet is ok, just a bit flies. Maybe it was off-season when I went, in early September, only three or four people had breakfast "
1	Because of the convenience of work, traffic is a big consideration for frequent trips to and from this hotel. But now Tongbao Bus and Yongdong Bus do not run to this hotel, and there is less convenience. Checking in two days ago, the front desk noticed that it happened to be my birthday, and specially arranged a cake as a gift, which was very heartwarming. 
0	Conditions are too bad! The room area is too small, it is not like a 4* hotel! 
0	The color and style are dull. The cooling vent is on the left and the left hand is uncomfortable. There is no USB on the right. There is no XP system and no bag. 
1	I stayed for one night when I returned to Heilongjiang in early October. All my evaluations are based on the local situation in Qiqihar. I don't think I can compare it with similar hotels in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. The surrounding environment is pretty good, there are basically taxis waiting downstairs at any time, and there are shopping malls and supermarkets nearby. The service is very good, active and enthusiastic, the umbrella forgot the service desk, very active to remind me. No harassing calls. It is a little noisy, and the phone calls from the service desk in the corridor can be heard occasionally. Without a computer, I don't know the network situation. Because of the train time problem, I originally planned to delay check-out by one hour, but the service desk proactively extended it by 2 hours. The central air-conditioning is also good, I don't know what will happen in winter, the shower hot water is very good. 
0	The special room is very small. Four steps to the corner of the room are basically separated by non-sound-proof panels. The sound of the TV next door and the moaning of men and women working in the night and the sound of bathing in the adjacent room can be clearly heard. It is just a gun for netizens to meet. The air quality in the room is very poor and cannot be exhausted by ventilation. The price of Ctrip is the same as the retail price. The main consideration is that the place of work is nearby. 
0	I haven’t found it yet. In other words, there’s no need to find out what’s inadequate for such a cheap book. 
0	A lousy hotel with similar two stars! I don't know how to get the 3 stars? First of all, the room is very dark and the walls are very dirty! There are signs of water seepage on the wall, and the bathroom is very, very small! ! ! There is no bathtub and so on with a shower curtain between them. The towels are very worn out, and I think they are too dirty! ! ! The room's color light is severely lacking, and the service attitude is not good. I keep saying that my room is full, but I haven't watched the computer for personal registration! Let the change of houses push three blocks and four blocks! This is Samsung's standard. . 
0	The room was old, and the bed sheets were changed to a clean one upon request. There was obviously a double room, but the front desk told me that there was only a luxury suite. The waiter thought that the guest did not understand Cantonese, and privately said: He has booked a suite and cannot change her , Really outrageous! Hotel feedback March 4, 2008: Thank you for your valuable comments, we will correct it. One of the first floors is currently being renovated, welcome to give pointers. 
1	Advantages: This notebook has good performance, suitable for girls, and it is pink! The suggestions are as follows: 1. Please change the payment method for placing large orders. It will be more convenient if you can pay directly by credit card online. Currently, I want to spend less than 500 on China Merchants Bank’s credit card online. I have to use Alipay every time, but why can I use it to buy air tickets directly online? Please communicate this issue with the bank 
1	Reasons for a good book: 1. It really speaks the truth of the foot bath. If you want to understand foot bathing, after reading and understanding this book, you will become a foot bath expert, at least a theoretical expert; 2. It does introduce a lot of practical and simple methods. 3. There are indeed taboos in bathing feet, and it's all right. 
0	"So so, don't know why it sells so well? Compared with ""The Weakness of Human Nature"", this book is far behind. ｀｀ "
0	I only have two words of disappointment for Xinyue Pavilion. I dare to say that those comments are written by themselves. There are too many cheap and good inns in Lijiang. There is no need to book in advance. The price of Xinyue Pavilion can be used in other better inns. It has been several days, and there is no place to put small things in his room. I suggest that everyone go to the inn on the road of Wangu Building. It has a large view, good and cheap, everyone keep the money to play! 
1	I'm almost finished reading it, although some parts are not very clear, but I also learned to agree and let go. There are things that you can have if you don’t want them; for some things, you will be happy if you keep holding on to them; for some people, if you don’t cherish them, they won’t leave~ We must learn to know who we are and who we are , And then face yourself, face up to the love of others. Pain. After crying and accepting it gladly, you will find that your body and mind will be extremely relaxed. . . 
0	Using battery power to automatically cut off the power, 3 times in 2 weeks, not an individual problem, we have found a lot, we have organized a group, and are ready to co-brand and want to have an opinion to Lian! It has nothing to do with Jingdong, I still hate Jingdong satisfaction! ! 
0	The appearance is average. bulky! After using it for 2 days, the sound quality is average, not as good as the introduction. The touchpad is close to the keyboard, making it easy to touch when typing! Not used to it yet! 
1	Advantages: The service in the lobby and housekeeping department is very good and enthusiastic (because there is no refrigerator to help us get ice cubes from out). The characteristic big bed room comes with tea pillows and some interesting magazines. The location is good, with Carrefour around. The shopping plaza, the transportation is convenient, the breakfast is great, the buffet is very rich, Chinese and Western styles are available, and the speed of adding dishes is very fast. Disadvantages: Very poor sound insulation, woken up by the guests next door at night. Work started and I can't sleep at all. No small refrigerator, TV, no satellite channels, facilities such as toilets, towels are a bit old, but ok 
1	I like the color pages very much, and the sentence patterns are not rigid, very modern, very commonly used, and very spoken. What's more, it is also important for people who only know the kana syllabary to learn, because each kanji has katakana for reference. In fact, I personally feel that if you learn a language, you can finish the basic pronunciation, and then come with some basic spoken language. The two complement each other, the foundation is solid, and the advancement is easy. However, in the meantime, the accumulation of words requires effort, and we need to think about how to memorize these words. I like this book very much~ while studying. 
0	It mainly introduces the meridian acupoints. I feel that it is a little bit of the east and a little bit, the content is very scattered, and the method inside is very vague, and it will be ranked as a bestseller, and it feels like a fool 
0	The appearance of the hotel is relatively magnificent, but the rooms are really shabby, the facilities are outdated, and the sanitation is average. However, there are fewer hotels in Daqing, and after searching, there are indeed no hotels. 
0	I want to check out one hour late, but I was told that late check-out will be charged at an hourly rate, 50 yuan per hour, which is too inhuman. I don’t know if there are any rewards for early check-out. 
0	1. The room is small 2. The room is not well ventilated, and the smell is a bit big 3. The furniture and sheets are outdated 4. The internet is sometimes unavailable. 
1	Jingdong’s response speed is very good. The order was placed in the afternoon of the first day, and the arrival was notified the next morning. It was good; the books were very good, but they were not very good when they were packaged. The film on the surface was crumpled and there was a lot of dust; After I got the goods back, my colleagues helped to do some tests. The test results showed that the books are very good, which is enough for me who does not play games. 
1	Maybe it was built earlier, and it feels like the interior is not very prominent. 
0	After using it for four days, I temporarily found that: one is that the touchpad is slightly hot during use, and the other is that the three USB ports are loose, and the mouse is disconnected when it is loosened. 
0	"I was buying and selling one each of <<Seeking a doctor is worse than seeking oneself 1>> and <<Seeking a doctor is worse than seeking oneself 2>>. In the end, I only sent me a book that lacked 12 pages in the text. I say no stock! If there is no stock, the computer system will reflect when the customer places an order, and the order will not take effect. How can it be said that it is out of stock when it is shipped? Since it can be said ""the world's largest online store"", the computer system will be so imperfect ? Just seeing the increase in product orders, I took the opportunity to say that it was out of stock, and then increased the price! The establishment of an order is a contract signed by the buyer and the seller. Both parties should fulfill their promises, how can we forget the benefits? Profit depends on real ability, not such a shameless little hand-off! "
0	"I did my homework before I went. It is generally said that the hotels in Jiujiang and Lushan are a lower grade than the average city, so I am mentally prepared, so I feel comfortable when I check in on the evening of the 5th. The important thing is that the free broadband Internet gives the children a surprise, so Became the biggest reason to continue staying (I felt too prepared to change place the next day on the way to the hotel). There is no elevator, the first step of the lobby stairs is a toilet, the door is open to see the facilities inside, a little smell, strange setting! The rooms on the third floor are even stranger: one side of the aisle is a guest room, the other is a staff room, and there are public toilets. The corridor is narrow and because the public toilet is small, it opens the door directly to the aisle. You can directly feel the smell of the staff toilet. The location of the hotel is quite remote, I thought it would be quiet, but the soundproofing is too bad, the sound of the door outside the window can be heard clearly, you can hear several employees chatting, and there is the sound of a small valley at the door. The room is old, especially the bathroom feels a bit dirty (perhaps the smell of the toilet floating from the corridor?) The words ""Gu Gongli Bone Cushion and Square Bone Cushion"" are pasted on the wall of the bathtub. I wondered, and later figured out that it was like this. ""Slide in the bathtub, please put a non-slip mat"", haha... the next morning, the toilet was blocked and it took more than half an hour to call! Fortunately, we are a leisure trip, there is no time limit, no need to worry. Later, another incident happened that made us completely disappointed with this hotel: after waiting for a long time for the toilet to be open, and after washing up, I finally went out and decided to go to Guling Street and walk on the upper line first. But there was no car and called the general station to ask a car for 15 yuan to the street. The driver was fooled by the driver (blame that his position is not firm!) hurriedly decided to charter a car for 150 yuan to tour the first line. Some scenic spots in the middle were missed (because of the day The map of the scenic spot was lost in the process, and I found it later). Finally, we said that we were waiting for us at the Lulin Lake Bridge. As a result, we got on the Lulin Bridge for half an hour and didn’t wait for the bus. So we had to take a taxi back to the hotel. Neither the house nor the meeting place went. The actual use of the car is three times: 1. Hotel-Flower Path; 2. Xianrendong-Street (lunch); 3. Street-Power Station Dam. Later, the driver came to the hotel to make a big noise. After all, there was a dispute between us. What is damn is the accent of the front desk lady and the driver, I don’t know what they think of customers! Later, I contacted Lushan Hotel to stay. The price of a small standard room was about the same. Except for the lack of broadband Internet access, everything was better than Xiaoxia. Lubin's large standard rooms have internet access, but the price is also more expensive. "
0	The original battery was replaced. The battery is not in good contact. The standby time is only more than two hours after being fully charged. Dell engineers verified that the battery of this machine is a counterfeit 
0	The surface of the piano is easy to get fingerprints, and the image effect of the camera is a bit too bad. A lock switch of the battery cannot be automatically locked. It can be locked by manually flipping it. Also, it is too troublesome to download the driver CD without XP. 
0	The hotel is too poor, sanitary conditions and services are poor. When I checked in, there were sheets and towels to be washed in the lobby. It was a mess. I suggest that Xiecheng.com cancel its membership 
1	Sometimes I really feel that there is a situation of seeing the truth in adversity. When Zhen Huan encounters such a situation, Dr. Wen will never leave him. Although Zhen Huan does not love him, he still guards her by her side. If one day, even if there is a person I don’t love, who will never abandon me when I am down, then even if I don’t love him, I will accept his love for me. Although the Six Kings and Zhen Huan really love each other, they can't go together in the end. This is the most painful thing in the world. 
0	Stayed here many times. But it feels that the service quality of the hotel is declining, and the price is rising. The downstairs of the room I stayed in was being renovated and it smelled great. I called the front desk, and the front desk said there was no room, so I was asked to be patient. It was solved by the front desk manager's theory. 
1	"This is the third time I stayed at the China Shipbuilding Hotel. It has almost become my designated place to stay in Beijing. The room layout is simple and clean, the bathroom is not big, but it is also very clean. I really like the stairs with wooden handrails, and it feels casual to walk around the room. The last time I checked in, the curtain slide was very smooth; the shower in the bathroom had a large amount of water, and the shower was very pleasant. The main thing is that there is no peculiar smell in the room, unlike some hotels that have such a damp smell. So rest assured. The quality of service is not bad, but the last time I checked in, the lady at the front desk was a little cold and not warm. I saw the ""Reception Hotel Designated by the Central Authorities"" on the wall. "
0	The last time I went to live, I still feel very upset, there are no stars at all, so old hotel, except that the room is big, the things are scary, the towels are washed in the basin three times, it is still very mixed with water, never live again 
0	Financial reporting is slow, the speed of the machine is slow, there is no problem after sales, it is the problem of the machine, or it is not their problem, too XX! 
0	I don’t like it very much. They talk about attitudes towards health. The specific knowledge is only a rough reference. There is no practical reference. ~~! ! 
0	"2008-01-10 The order included ""The Beauty Sutra of a 31-year-old Little Beauty"", but it was not delivered. Is it out of stock? what is this else? There is no statement on the express delivery and the receipt! Please explain. Thank you! "
1	The appearance is not bad...the configuration is okay, I don’t play games enough, and HP’s sound effects are not bad. The price is relatively high. 
1	I just left this one at will, remove all the hidden partitions of the entire hard drive, repartition, and copy the previous system over, everything is ok. No problem. 
0	I didn't expect that in modern Beijing, there are still such low-end hotels with high fees! ! ! The so-called economic standard room is small and unreasonable. How can it be worthy of a 3-star listing? ? ? ? ? ? 
1	Unexpectedly, I gave breakfast coupons and a 50 yuan meal coupon when checking in. After using the buffet breakfast, I used an executive set meal in the revolving restaurant at noon, and there was still 3 yuan left, but I did not refund it. Yes, the hotel includes two meals, socialism. 
1	Definitely a great value hotel. If it is not for luxury, every part of this hotel is absolutely satisfactory. (AvlNtTy) 
0	Heat dissipation needs to be enhanced, but the 12-inch model seems to be basically the same. . The vista system is not used to it. . . 
1	The surrounding environment of the hotel is good, very close to the business district, and quiet. But the hotel is a bit old and the decoration is outdated. 
0	Checked in the day before yesterday, I feel not as good as last time. I lived in the same room 2 years ago. Now the facilities are old, breakfast is also very poor, and the staff service in the parking lot is very poor. I will not choose to live here next time. It's not as comfortable as home! 
1	This is a purely contemporary romance novel. If you have never loved, hated, or divorced, read this novel and find a similar pattern in your heart to interpret a deduced love story. If you have loved, hated, or separated and combined, then when you have nothing to do one night, pass your time to see how young people weave a life of ups and downs, disappointments, but ultimately a complete drama. Life should be a compromise. A life that can't learn or can't see compromise is just a life in the book. 
1	4999 in, the game is basically xb360 or desktop, so whether there is independent display has little effect. 
1	I’ve always liked it, but this time I have a few questions: First, the waiter at the hotel’s entrance was too indifferent and it was useless. It rained the morning when I arrived at the hotel and there were a lot of things. They actually stood there when I took a taxi. I didn't move, not even reaching for the door. If you want a tip, I think someone will definitely give it to you. Suggest improvements, at least you can help the guests take things. Second, the hotel reception was not notified in time. When I checked in that day, I said that I was staying for two nights, but the front desk staff only asked me to press a deposit of 500 yuan, and then did not notify me. I returned to the hotel the next day and found that the door could not be opened. I called and asked before telling me that the deposit was not enough. Obviously, the service is not humane at all and I hope it can be improved. In addition, the hotel’s luggage storage service is very good, and the environment is also very good. Generally speaking, it is ideal. I hope to improve the above two problems and do better, so that guests will like your hotel more. Looking forward to your improvement and reply.

0	There is no special content, it is the same as other books of the same kind, and they are all common sense. I read it in half an hour, and the content in the visible period is very empty 
1	The price is fair and the performance is outstanding. I am from Beijing. Delivery is very fast~! The deliveryman delivered it to me under the heavy rain. Like it~! The screen is perfect~1 It's cool to play games and watch movies~! The speed is also very fast~! Good heat dissipation 
0	I placed an order but did not receive the book, depressed! ! ! If you don’t update the webpage and discover that the stock is out of stock during the distribution, you should notify the customer in time! 
1	For a 10-inch brand notebook with XP upgraded CPU and strong battery life, the price is still acceptable. Whether the machine is the power supply or the machine itself, the certification is comprehensive, and the strength of the brand. I have also worked hard on the details, whether it is function or appearance, some designs are basically available, and the power cord and adapter have nylon straps. Therefore, it is convenient and safe to use. As an entertainment netbook, it can meet basic needs. 
0	Installing XP system is too difficult~! After a day's work, I installed VISTA at the end~! The specifics that just started have to be explored~! 
0	If you change to XP, you need to install a specific oem disk. For general disks, you need to enter the BIOS to turn off SATA, otherwise, it will not be recognized. Vista, it seems to be easy to install, but difficult to activate. My friend has been unsuccessful... Recently, the speaker has no sound. It is said that it suddenly disappeared while watching a movie. 
0	It's too hot, the air outlet is so hot. You cannot install the original version when installing XP, only the Ghost version with integrated sata driver 
1	I have always believed that everyone should read books about survival skills. In the event of an emergency, perhaps a certain detail you have seen can kill a person or even a group of people. People are fragile. People who leave their tools are more fragile than an ant in nature. Survival skills are especially important at this time. I hope that everyone who loves to read can take a good look at the books in this area and recommend them to relatives and friends, so that everyone can make the right choice when their lives are threatened. 
0	It is definitely a fingerprint collector, it is too easy to leave fingerprints, and if you want to increase the memory, it is actually very difficult! 
1	The room is very clean. I live in a south-facing room. The sun is very comfortable. I can surf the Internet now, and the internet speed is pretty good. The hotel’s traffic is old and convenient, a quiet place in the middle of noisy. I always like the Huguosi snacks on Yuetan North Street. The hotel offers 10 yuan for lunch and dinner. The disadvantage is that the sound insulation is not very good. In general, it is good and business is good. 
1	The heat dissipation is the best. The CUP runs 100% for 10 minutes or 60 degrees. The design is still my favorite aluminum composite frame. 
0	Personally, I feel that reading this kind of book does not improve my English proficiency very much. Basically, it is not helpful. It may not be suitable for me. Disappointed. 
1	This book gathers many methods of English learning, instead of just some older and more traditional methods, he tells readers how to use it as a language and how to understand the rich situation of English as a first language country. It is a rare good partner for English learners. In use is a good description of how we are asking us to use it and how to survive in a foreign country. This is not important. It is also the ultimate goal of learning English. pretty good. Like like like! ! ! ! ! 
1	I am a sophomore majoring in English, this is a book highly recommended by the professor. It’s not easy to find Dangdang and sell it. Although it is not cheap, it is really good value for money. The content of the book is so wonderful, it can be regarded as a treasure for people who understand the Eastern and Western cultures. The book is more detailed, the language used is rigorous, but not tedious and complicated, and easy to understand. Yesterday, I showed it to a German friend who graduated with a Ph.D. He was also full of praise. For international students who are good at Chinese, it is a good gift-giving book. 
1	1. Good heat dissipation, very good 2. The screen is very bright and clear 3. I think the keyboard is also good 4. The camera is very clear 5. The most important point, cost-effective 
1	1. The front desk is very polite and can respond quickly to customers' reasonable requests. 2． Nice hotel. 3. Would recommend to friends. 
1	"The appearance is very beautiful, the system interface is beautiful, the keyboard feels very good, and the touch control console is also very practical. Insufficient ""The hard disk has only two partitions, and I don’t know how to partition "
1	This is a book-related book. This is a book that readers want to read. The stories in the book record the readers' experiences of reading, buying books, scouring books, and collecting books, and give us post-scholars a lot of enlightenment. Let us cherish our current reading environment even more. We can read as long as we want to read now. More importantly, you can use the Internet to get the knowledge you want. Therefore, reading good books, reading good books, and being friends with books should become the mainstream of life in our society. Therefore, I love books, all kinds of materials, books, and articles related to books. 
0	This book is not as good as I expected. The quality and printing of the book itself are okay, but the content does not match the title of the book, so the name should be changed; and there are a lot of far-fetched places, and some places are a bit hard to beat. Come out and say...); I feel that the author is a little reluctant to scrape the content, want to make the book look thicker? Personal advice, for reference only; 
1	I always think that it should not be emphasized that children should deliberately understand their own bad emotions, and there are already many books on children's psychology at home. However, he still bought this set of books for Xiao Mu, he didn't pay attention to the part of the book about regulating emotions, he only paid attention to why this kid was crying? Why is he afraid of sliding? Maybe he will understand some after he is three years old. I think the adjustment methods mentioned in this book are still less and more general. But I really like the pictures in the book, except for the little rabbit, which seems to make me so angry. The painting is worse. 
0	It is estimated to be the worst hotel in the hotel I stayed on a business trip this month. It can be said that it is not as good as home. The price is 328, breakfast is included, and it is given to the 9th floor. When you open the elevator, you know it’s wrong, dirty carpet , The door of the room is tattered and can't be opened yet, withdraw! The person at the front desk below asked what was wrong. Later, I was going to upgrade to a superior room. Let’s take a look. Oh, it’s still bad, but it’s almost 6 o’clock and the road is snowing again. There are other things to do, so I’ll do it at night. When I came back, the toilet was leaking or hot. I sat on it, steaming and wet buttocks. For the first time, the bathroom was very ordinary, the old hotel with toothless teeth, and I especially hate the waiter at the front desk. I don’t dare to serve in the future. If you stay at this hotel again, the Ctrip operator will say that it is a good star hotel, and you know you are cheating money 
0	I snapped it up at 3999, so lucky. What else is there for the price? The brand and price are very good 
1	"I seem to have a habit. If a story is divided into two books, then read it from the second one. If it is divided into more, choose one book to read. The book ""Niu Mao"" was the second one I read at the beginning. I felt that the cat was so similar to the one I raised. When I finished reading the whole book, I realized that it was just my cat. , Most of them have a commonality. The variety is the same. The author's fat cat is very funny, and it can also make people feel the truth of life while reading easily. It's not helpful to talk about it, but I suggest you take a look, especially if there are fur balls at home. "
0	In addition to being cheap, there are basically no other advantages. The bathroom facilities are quite simple, the room has only two bedside lamps, no broadband, and occasionally can receive wireless routing signals from nearby residents' homes; the so-called double breakfast is for each room Breakfast coupons for 10 yuan, only a few varieties are marked with prices, even peanuts are sold for 2 yuan a plate, each person needs to pay in cash after more than 5 yuan. 
0	I received the book. Like the friend above, I did not receive the gift that should be attached to the book!!! Indeed, it is a notepad thing, it looks small, the key is the lack of credibility!!! I think of many friends More and more people are switching from Dangdang to the excellent book shopping. Why is this? Dangdang should reflect on it carefully. You can't start bullying customers more and more because of the big development! Hope Dangdang will give me a satisfying Answer!!! 
0	I have stayed in many three or four-star hotels, and Qinghai Hotel is the most disappointing one. I saw that the photos on the Internet are not bad, but they are actually quite different. The hotel is relatively old. Whether it is the color of the room or the furniture in the room, it feels like a guest house from the 90s. I booked a double bed room, the bed is directly facing the toilet door, and the towels in the bathroom are also dark, and I feel like I can’t wash it out. There are nuisance calls at night, and the soundproofing of the room is not good. What’s interesting is that I wanted to store my luggage in the hotel. The lady at the information desk took a piece of paper and wrote a receipt to me. She didn’t even have a formal receipt. This shows the lack of management and I don’t know how to comment. Four stars. So, the next day I moved to another place. 
1	An Yiru is also a sentimental woman. A talented woman, just like she herself described, a first-class talented woman, even after a thousand years, her mind is in common, and her breath and charm are like the sandalwood wardrobe left in an old house. She is always tall and thick. The style, when it was opened, was confused with a faint fragrance, and felt a trance. Her poetry reviews are more about women’s thoughts. While admiring her literary heritage, she can also encounter sentences from time to time that are touching, tearful, and not tired of chewing. It seems that there is only It was a pity to write it down. 
0	I waited 10 days from when I placed the order to when I got it! And I can’t make 10 calls a day! But the customer service attitude is not bad 
0	The expectation before check-in is still very high, but I feel disappointed after arrival. There is still a certain gap between the value of this budget hotel with a price of less than 200 yuan, such as Qidouxing and Homeinn, and the evaluation of colleagues who went with it is not high. I regret not asking for any service, but I don’t know how to check out the speed 
0	The location is acceptable, but the location from the beach is much worse than expected. You can only look at the sea from a distance and there is no parking lot. 
1	Overall, the book is good. At least in the book, it describes many problems in the judicial system that exist in reality, which is worth thinking about every legal worker. Especially for those young people who are not deeply involved in the world and want to join the ranks of lawyers to see the real side of society, especially the Chinese judicial circle. The disadvantage is that the book quoted a large number of legal provisions and judicial interpretations, which is a bit redundant for lawyers or legal workers with certain working experience, and it takes up a lot of space and is suspected of making up the word count. Overall it is good. Don't place too much demand on a book. 
0	The payment was successful on May 8th. Dangdang.com showed that it will be shipped on May 10th, but so far I haven’t seen the goods or received any notice. Jane doesn’t know how to say it! ! !

1	This hotel is relatively old, and the special rooms are also very average. Generally speaking 
0	I was very excited about the screening, but after watching it, I found that after the screening, an episode of Mickey Mouse appeared! At first, I wondered whether it was an individual phenomenon of gifting, but later I found that every DVD had it! I really don’t know what the manufacturer thinks, I want to see cats and mice, not Mickey Mouse! If the manufacturer wants to give it away, then the full set of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck will be given away. What about adding one episode to each DVD? ? It is superfluous! ! 
0	It's a bit heavier, maybe because the hard disk is big, it's just a bit lighter. Others need further verification. The several kinds of films attached have many bubbles, so they should be replaced soon. The screen film is a little better, but it is much better than none. It is recommended to provide a few films for users to post. 
1	Convenient transportation; good environment; good service attitude and small rooms 
1	Yes, the author’s point of view is very subverting the current educational methods of Chinese parents. In fact, the ancients already had a very systematic system for education, but now parents and grandparents are more pampered and pampered with their children. Looking at it, selfish children are big For the most part, parents feel that as long as their children don’t suffer a loss outside, it’s a good thing, and they completely put aside the ancient educational teachings summarized by the ancients for thousands of years. Therefore, it is recommended that mothers-to-be can learn how to educate their children to be caring, responsible, tolerant, and generous while waiting for the baby to arrive. 
1	With the foreshadowing of the first book, I started to enter the state when reading the second book. Basically, the second book focuses on the ability training of the protagonists. The main venue of the story is set in the Amazon jungle of America. I have been wondering what this has to do with Tibet, but I probably only read the book to know the clues inside. It describes many mysterious animals and plants unique to tropical rain forests, as well as some survival skills and common sense, which benefit a lot. It can be imagined how much effort the author would spend to collect and organize and write such a book and integrate such a lot of knowledge. 
0	The reception at the front desk is too bad. The hotel is divided into the AB building. After I checked-in, the front desk did not tell where the building B is, and there was no obvious indication on the building B; the room is too small, not like a 4-star facility at all. Choose to stay in this shop again. 
1	1. White, very beautiful, and good workmanship; 2. The software resources on the Internet are very rich, which is the main reason why I bought it; 3. The battery is good. Yesterday, there were 25 minutes from 2pm to 10pm. The remaining time (camera turned off, wireless and Bluetooth) mainly copy things, and it seems to be no problem for about eight hours of normal use; 4. The heat dissipation is good, the CPU core is only 40~55 degrees, and many small books have to be up to 80 degrees; 5. Transformer It's very small. Many small notebooks use large notebooks. The notebooks are very light, but they are still heavy for travel. 
1	I bought a lot of books on Dangdang, and I was too lazy to comment. But this set of books is really good, all 3 books are very exciting. My little one's daughter, who knows many words, loves her very much, she must read before going to bed every day. She also told me that there are the same articles in the school's Chinese textbook. I also lent it to my colleague’s daughter. My colleague has always had a headache. Her daughter does not like to read books, but her daughter likes this set of books very much. Read it in two weeks. It is recommended to buy. I rarely write reviews, but I can’t help writing for this set. Also give other readers reference. 
0	The hard drive went on strike after 19 days~~~ I didn't use it for 15 days after the last week~~~ But it just can’t be replaced~~~ Alas~~~~ What do you think about this~~~ 
0	"As soon as the book arrived, it was borrowed by a friend. I had already read it. I bought it because of Zhang Ailing. After reading Zhang Zijing's ""My Sister Zhang Ailing"", it can be seen that Zhang is not very enthusiastic towards her brother. This is her character. But once Zhang Zijing went to find her, Zhang Ailing looked very happy that day. Later Zhang Zijing calculated that Zhang Ailing was in love with Hu Lancheng at that time. Many people are not ashamed of Hu Lancheng's improper use of emotions. Of course I am also disgusted, but I also want to say that Hu Lancheng has given Zhang Ai's joy. What a smart woman Zhang is, if it were not for love, she would not be so foolish. The love that belongs to them, let them taste and bear. Hu's writing is indeed good, there is a kind of elegance in it. I don't know if it's that faint atmosphere that once made Zhang Xin moved-""The years are quiet and the world is stable"". "
0	The printing of the book does not look good, the picture is not beautiful, and the content is not even good, so it looks like it can't attract the children's interest and eyeballs at all, but it really doesn't want to sleep and read it, which is hypnotic. For instance, I don't like to talk about these books. 
1	Not many netizens commented on the hot issue. For the first time, you have to manually install winxp and reset the motherboard blis-hard drive. 
1	Excuse me: Some words are typed wrong, how can I go back and edit them? 
0	There is no Bluetooth, camera, and even a microphone. It is a little troublesome to install XP. The original MSDN version cannot be installed without SATA driver. It is OK to install the GHOST pure version. The built-in wireless network card driver cannot be used and needs to be downloaded from the official website. 
1	"I occasionally saw other people’s recommendations on the Internet, so I bought a copy and looked at it for ease. That day, I took a plane to Beijing. On the plane, I kept smirking and tried to restrain myself. At any rate, I also had to pretend to be a ""Dulala""-like image of a jobless spirit. When I got off the plane, I just finished watching, but I started to feel confused. It always feels like a bite of a big sweet potato. Although it is delicious, it is stuck under the esophagus and feels panicked. When I took a taxi to the hotel, I saw that Beijing was still cold in the early spring, and suddenly I felt like an epiphany. The youth of Beijing is so different from that of the South, and there is a little sadness besides being tough. "
0	The new machine has hardware problems, and it took 6 days to arrive, and it will be repaired the next day. So far, we have not received any advice! 
0	The fan is really loud enough, especially at night when the surrounding area is quiet. The fan is turned on frequently, and the heat is quite amazing 
1	A good choice with low price and good quality. It is very suitable to stay on the plane at night, the service is very warm, the room is refreshing without carpet, and the sea view is beautiful 
0	I checked in at about 6:30 in the evening. At that time, a male waiter registered for me. I asked him if he could do a credit card pre-authorization. He said no, but suggested that I can use cash as a deposit until I check out with a credit card. . The room is large but very old. The TV can only receive 4 TV programs. On the third day, I asked to use a credit card when I checked out. At that time, a waitress said that I used cash as a deposit and it was not acceptable to use it. For credit card consumption, I also asked me why I didn’t pre-authorize when I checked in if I wanted to spend. At that time, I told him what the male waiter had said before and then replied that it was because the machine was broken and couldn’t be used. , I told her that I saw a customer 30 minutes ago and used a credit card to spend. Why did it break so quickly? She saw that my attitude was so tough and helped me spend with the card. In fact, it proved that the credit card machine did not It's not bad. At that time, because we rushed to the airport to take a plane, we didn't talk to her anymore, but we always felt angry. 
0	I snapped it up at 3999, so lucky. What else is there for the price? The brand and price are very good 
1	This time I stayed at the Shaolin Hotel and I was quite satisfied. The location of the hotel is easier to find. It only takes three minutes to take a taxi from the bus terminal, and it can be reached for 5 yuan. The room is relatively clean, and it is relatively spacious. Comfortable, the best place is that there is a very busy snack street outside the hotel. It opens around 6 in the evening. There are many snacks such as spicy and spicy, and there are at least 20 or 30 stalls. There are many choices. It is very convenient to solve the problem of eating. , And the price is quite commentable. Together with my friend, two people can eat well for ten dollars :) 
1	I have basically bought this set of books, and I have read a lot of them. It is a good stuff to consolidate English and learn knowledge in free time. Of course, no matter how good things are, they need to be suitable. If you think your current task is to sprint learning, then this book may not be suitable for you. However, if you want to have a long-term study habit, you can consider this set of English books. In addition, MP3 is also very good, you can listen to it on the way to and from get off work, just like listening to a radio novel, which improves listening in entertainment. 
1	The hotel facilities are acceptable, and there are too many mirrors in the room. Ctrip’s package includes fruit and chocolate, which is more cozy. The service is average. The front desk tried to induce me to buy breakfast when I checked in. The breakfast was 440 yuan per day for two children and a total of 880 for two days. In addition, you can eat whatever you want in the refrigerator, but I refused! The next day I stopped sending fruit chocolates, and I didn't even give two free bottles of water... The hotel is about 15 minutes' walk from Kowloon Festival Walk, There is a park next to it, but it is a bit far from the subway, and it needs to be a minibus. Sometimes it is 6 yuan per person, sometimes 3 yuan per person. It is very scary to drive fast, and the child is the same cost, but I am not satisfied with this point, or live away from the subway It is more convenient recently. 
1	The room environment at this price is very good and it feels very clean^_^ I personally feel very elegant in Xingwang Building... Next time I come, I will definitely book it here. . . 
0	The chosen case is too bizarre, it exaggerates the practical significance of psychological counseling and makes people lose their sense of trust! If the effect of writing in this way can catch the reader's attention at the beginning, but when he sees the explanation of the reasons for the psychological problems of the protagonist in the case, he gradually loses interest. 
1	Simple, generous, not heavy, light and thin in a notebook of the same size! Very quiet, almost no sound, good sound quality, good screen, delicate and impressive display. Thanks to the staff at the delivery point of Maliandao (front desk customer service), the service attitude is super good, it is worth learning from other employees of your company. 
0	I found a bad block when I got the hard drive. Because it was a perfect screen, I didn’t go back to Jingdong for a new one. It took two days to replace the hard drive locally. I didn’t need an invoice. The battery connection is loose and there is a 1mm gap. When leaving the factory, A and B sides The protective film attached is too perfunctory, and there are too many bubbles. Although it has to be torn off anyway, it shows that the manufacturer's attitude is not rigorous. 
1	I didn't find any advantages. I turned it back on and there was nothing. It didn't take much effort to have my own XP installed. There were some problems with Mai. The other party can't hear clearly. It took a long time to get better, overall it's not bad 
1	The appearance is beautiful, and the system is not difficult to make. At first, I read a lot of evaluations and said that it is hard to make. In fact, it is not so difficult. Choose the first option of the boot option to start from DVD, and the others are installed directly. Mine is the installation disk, not Ghost. The memory is Samsung DDR3-1066, not DDR3-800. The Everest test is DDR3-800. I tested it with Super Rabbit and it is DDR3-1066. AUO LED screen, independent display, satisfied, and the perfect screen is good. 
1	The order placed on the afternoon of the 9th, got the goods at 11 noon, really great. After the machine was turned on, I found an inner bag and a wiper cloth. I tried it for more than 2 hours. I found that the sound was very small and the download speed was very high. Yes, you can open the webpage at the same time 6-7 not stuck. 
0	If the presented system is slow, just modify XP. The built-in backup is GHOST. It should be equipped with a USB computer cable. 
1	I originally booked two suites online. After I checked in, Ctrip called me to ask if I only checked in one room and charged the money in my credit card. I really don't know how the hotel and Ctrip are connected? Hotel Feedback December 7, 2007: We are very grateful for your message and sorry for the confusion caused by some small misunderstandings. According to our guaranteed reservation requirements, the room rate of the day will be charged for those who do not show in the confirmed room. Of course, we will further strengthen our communication and coordination with Ctrip to make your stay in the future more comfortable and pleasant. 
0	This book is terrible. There is nothing to read aloud in the manual. I don't want to read it after reading a few pages. 
0	The hotel is actually an internal guest house of Lanzhou Railway Bureau. It is located at the exit of the railway station. If you are not afraid of noisy trains, you can sleep well at night. The price is not cheap, it can only be average. The room is very old, the equipment in the room is average, the sanitary exhaust fan is broken, and the toilet is broken. The maintenance staff is very temperamental and should be treated politely. The quality of the front desk staff is relatively poor. When I checked out in the morning, the front desk could not find the waiter. I waited for nearly half an hour, wasting precious time. There is a charge for parking at the hotel. It is recommended not to use this hotel as a check-in option unless you have special feelings for trains. 
0	"It was a colleague who strongly recommended this book. I see the online introduction and so many ""celebrity"" positions clamoring, and I feel that flicker is greater than the content. Colleagues were not reconciled and just bought it. . Sure enough, I yelled at it after watching it! "
0	There are countless bookings from Ctrip, but this one really doesn't appreciate it. An enzymatic smell started from the corridor, and so did the room. And the windows are sealed. The most hateful thing is that the clearly booked room includes two breakfasts, and the front desk only gives one meal coupon, and also said that if you want another one, the diners must register with their ID. I rely on, when China wants to eat food, ID cards are required. I spent two shares, so why should I only give one. For my other copy, I tore up the meal coupon and threw it away. This hotel is really overbearing, stay away from it in the future. 
0	The money was also paid, and the bookmaker couldn't wait, and finally found the customer service phone number. It turned out that the book was gone. The money was suddenly returned, and the unit found it to be bribery, and there was no proof. sad. . Dangdang has been in the business for so many years, and your president also medias every day. The service is still not detailed enough, or I can go to your customer to take care of the customer service. I must have bought a better book than the current one, and finally bought it. . Try it next time to Excellence to see if the service is as bad 
0	Easy to produce fingerprints. Not used to partitioning. Due to the large volume of shipments, I think it would be better to distribute the goods faster. I went to Zhongtong Express yesterday and I saw a lot of items from Jingdong. 
0	The six-core battery is installed in the back to protrude a large area that affects the appearance. The slow speed machine is a bit stuck. It is heavier than ordinary netbooks when singing. The touchpad and mouse are not sensitive and the sliding area is too small. 
1	This set of books was bought for my son, and the little guy is less than two and a half years old, which is the right age for this set of books. I have read many reviews before, and this set of books has received rave reviews and I am looking forward to it. Because a good book can bring people knowledge and joy, even if he is just a child. The moment I got the book, I was sure that my child would like this set of books very much. If this is the case, the little guy likes it very much. It is not so much to read, as to play this set of books. Coupled with the guidance and assistance of the adults, it is really a very good parent-child game. It’s the first time to write an evaluation, and hope to share good books. 
0	"I happily booked a room with Ctrip during my Qingming holiday. I wanted to have a luxurious self-driving tour. The room I was given was pitifully small. Compared with the environment of four-star and above hotels at home and abroad, the environment is not bad. It's ""bad""! When I checked in at the front desk, the staff told me that breakfast is free for children under 1.2 meters, so I made up for an adult’s breakfast. When I had breakfast the next day, the restaurant manager told me that children need to pay half the price, which is an external charge Full price! Finally, after some negotiations, the hotel lobby manager gave a discount of 20%, but it has left us with no fun! The hotel room environment is not worth the four-star level at all! The decoration is old, the rooms are small, but the location of the hotel is good, so can you set such a high price? Puzzled! Additional comments April 23, 2008: By the way, there is actually a charge for Internet access, which is the first one encountered in China! Incredible! "
0	Such a man overdone his head tenderly, unable to find a trace of manhood. Only say: This is good. . . This is also good. . . I can't appreciate the beauty of such writing. Love is also strange. Zhang Ailing fell in love with such a person, faintly, probably for a lifetime. 
0	The first time you install xp to half of the blue screen, but enter the bios, in the advanced column, change the hard disk mode from achi to ide. Drivers are available online, just download the g430 driver 
0	The CD-ROM drive is really not very good. I was afraid that it would hang when the system was installed. Fortunately, the system was installed smoothly. After the installation, a mirror image was made immediately. It is estimated that the CD-ROM drive will not be used in the future. 
1	When I first started designing, Alvar Aalto was the first predecessor who had destined for me, transcended the times and gave me guidance from the region. In his world, there are no conceptual constraints. This is the inner spirit and motivation that anyone who desires to design freely needs the most. The two prerequisites for beauty are cleanliness and humor. Beautiful people. And this architect may have more. IKEA still sells the curve board reading chair he designed in the 1930s. This book is good and cheap, suitable for everyone who loves free design, I think so. 1979 May Han 
0	The outer package is written as 2G of memory, but the inner list is marked as 1G. I don’t know what is going on. I hope friends who know about it can help me solve it, thank you. 
0	This book makes me feel that it is not worth buying. About Bi Shumin's sharp, free and easy details, it can not be reflected in this novel. It seems to cater to the needs of some low-level readers at present, and is a bit kitsch. Want to return. Because I didn't finish reading it directly. 
1	Stayed at the hotel on October 16. It feels good, the distance from the bus station and the train station is not very far. The room is clean and the space is very large. The surrounding traffic environment is also good. The floor may be higher, and there is no Any noise. There was a small episode of hot water pipe problems at night, but the service attitude was good, and the problem was solved in a timely manner, which did not affect the goodwill of the hotel. The main reason is that the price is very reasonable. It can be said that the hotel is very satisfied. The minor disadvantage is the hardware 
0	Generally speaking, it should be a two-star hotel. Because the booking time is relatively late, only this hotel is available. When checking in, asked the front desk for some information about the city of Huangshan, and they said they don’t know. A check-in takes 20 minutes , And just a few of us. The room facilities are very old and the stay is uncomfortable. 
0	Full of horrible metaphors For example: using toothpaste mixed with blood to describe the color of a string of pink pearls, why is it so embarrassing? ! 
1	You may not finish this book in one go, or it may not be exciting enough, but it is indeed a book worth reading with your heart. Living in the present, the so-called sorrow and fear are all made by the human brain out of the present. Every sentence and theory in the book need to be carefully understood, and you will benefit a lot. This is true! To be a simple and happy person is nothing more than that. Reading this book, if you read it with your heart, you will feel relieved suddenly, and you will open it all at once. You won't be worried or anxious because of the trivialities in life. This is a good book worth buying that teaches you to let go of stress. 
1	"Staying in the West Building Sea View Suite (it is said that it is closer to the sea), it should be said that the overall is very good, with an old five-star style. The service is also more enthusiastic. It may be due to old age or air-conditioning or offshore. There is a slight smell in the room. The thickness of the carpet is not 5 stars. Most of the furniture is in primary colors, and the carpet is also in color, not bright. The TV is outdated and the remote control doesn't work. What's more interesting is the big size of the electric kettle in the room, which seems to be imported. There are also 3 halls for breakfast, which are divided into Chinese and Western style, Cantonese style (I prefer this) and Japanese style, but you can only choose one of them and it ends at 10 o'clock. The corridor is a piece of sensor light. There is turn-down service, 1 small biscuits for afternoon tea, and a piece of cardboard with verses printed on the pillows with small flowers, praise! Sanitary ware is of poor quality, except for soap. On the non-smoking floors, guests smoke in the corridors and rooms (doors open), and no one stops them. Lack of newspaper supply. There is a girl in the bathroom that can be irritated, be careful, and praise one more. The view of the suite is very nice, it's really close to the sea, just behind. Slightly deviated from the commercial area, but not far, less than 3 kilometers by taxi to May Fourth Square. Additional comments March 6, 2008: I almost forgot, the driver I took a taxi straight to the east building, the man sliding the door gave me a piece of paper with the license plate number, like it. In addition, hotel services in Qingdao are generally good. But the waiter at the hotel may not have heard of ""Chrysanthemum Pu'er"". "
1	The room is a bit small. No other problems. It’s good. Last time I stayed with a Japanese guest. They liked it because there was NHK 
1	"""Divorce"" is also finished. ""Divorce"" translated into a more clear word, it should be called disillusionment. All hopes for life are shattered with the divorce of those who should be divorced. "
0	The workmanship is average, and there is a certain gap from expectations; the original is a bit thick, so thinner is fine; the keyboard is relatively small; the 16:9 screen is a bit unaccustomed; it is more difficult to reinstall the system, but fortunately, the system software overnight All done. 
0	The bed made a creaking sound, the soundproofing of the room was too poor, and the complimentary breakfast was very delicious. Additional comments July 22, 2008: We stayed in a standard room in the resort. 
1	The product is very good and satisfied, and the workmanship is very fine. The quality and performance are also very good value, that is, MSI's after-sales service points are only in provincial capitals, which is very inconvenient. 
0	"Dear readers, I especially like reading books and I very much support Dangdang.com for providing me with a platform for buying books. After reading the book ""Those Things in the Ming Dynasty"", to be honest, I personally dislike it very much. The most important thing is the lack of literary talent. It is difficult for a book to succeed without good language. As a history book, its story is very poor, sometimes humorous for the sake of humor, it seems particularly vulgar. A lot of reasoning is interspersed in the book, which makes the content of the book very complicated, uncoordinated, and uncomfortable. I don't know if I feel the same with me, this is just my humble opinion. In this tumultuous age, it is really not easy to write a book, but not easy to write a high-quality book. "
0	It would be better to choose between v system and XP system. After all, most people still prefer XP system. 
1	1. The noise of the fan is not too big, it should be a bit louder after the XP is modified. VISTA may have an adjustment function. 2. The heat dissipation is very good. This does not need to be explained. 3. The performance of the machine is good, and the price of the mainstream configuration is reasonable. 
1	The hotel is currently applying for five stars, but it seems that four stars are a bit reluctant. The lobby is grand, but the details are rough. The hardware needs to be strengthened. The service staff is polite and enthusiastic. The hotel room and breakfast are pretty good. 
0	Both the exterior and the internal facilities of the hotel have fallen behind. Please remind that the hotel was renovated in 2007 and it was only on the 10th to 14th floors. I am afraid that the guests of Ctrip will not be able to check in. In fact, the location is also average, although it is a 15-minute walk to the pedestrian street, but The daily round trip is not as good as living nearby. In short, the price of 488 is not worth it. 
1	"The hotel has a southern European style: small white doors, creamy yellow walls, wrought iron wall lamps, rattan furniture, and the shutter doors of the bathroom open to see the scenery outside the balcony. The breezy blowing of the white curtains leading to the terrace is simply a copy of ""Love Letter"". Light air conditioners are all auto-sensing and very advanced. There are few people in the off-season. Almost everyone in the 2,000-square-foot hot spring swimming pool. Soaking in the hot springs and applying a mask is not afraid to scare others. It's just that there is a lingering smell in the room, probably because it's not often that people come and add humidity. Breakfast is average. "
0	I haven't read the details yet. The quality of the book is so bad that it can't even be counted as pirated! There are missing pages, and some even a whole page is exposed! ! I was disappointed when I bought it for the first time! ! 
1	"It makes sense. . . ""Who are we working for?"" If we don't clarify this problem as soon as possible, and we don't adjust our mentality, we may not be successful in this life. In today's impetuous age, what do we need to rekindle the passion for work and realize self-worth? Is it an empty slogan that touches the heart, or a reflection that touches the bottom of my heart? If every employee can recognize and accept the simple life philosophy of ""We are working for others while we are working for ourselves"" from the bottom of their hearts, responsibility, loyalty and dedication will no longer be empty slogans. "
1	I stayed a few times, and this time I brought my friends to stay together. As a result, the breakfast at the hotel made us so disappointed, it got worse and worse. There was nothing to eat when I went at 9 o'clock. I will not Will come again. 
1	I bought ViewSonic because it specializes in monitors. The other things are similar in all brands, and they are not made by myself. It did not disappoint me. Although there is nothing to compare, I feel very good. In addition, the 250G hard drive does also It seems more affordable. The appearance is said to be the past. The battery is quite satisfactory for 3 hours, although I feel a bit sorry for the six-cell battery. 
0	Personally, I think this book is very general, not as good or as magical as others have said. Many things have been read on the Internet, but she just made a summary. . 
1	The hotel is OK, there are computers and digital TV in the room. Breakfast is average. The sound insulation effect is relatively poor, and the commercial street below is not very quiet. 
0	Yu Dan talks about how to learn from Confucius and Zhuangzi every day, and how to learn from it. Many things are far-fetched and incomprehensible. Yu Dan opened his mouth and said that nothing is done for merit or profit, but why did he swagger through the market and engage in so many hype activities! After all, for what---famous and fortune. The prosperity of the world is for profit; the hustle and bustle of the world is for profit. Yu Dan is really a model of live learning and application! 
1	"What is the purpose of martial arts? The integration of civil and military as Tao, tradition is not just writing. I like this sentence very much: it is supernatural and comprehensive, and it is perfect for understanding and understanding. This may be the best interpretation of Wu. There are several viewpoints in the book that I agree with: 1. Wu is not a theory of gods and ghosts, but real culture and art; 2. Wu has been developing and advancing with its unique footsteps; 3. All ethnic groups are Contributed to the development of Wu. After reading the book, I really want to learn ""The Flag Stick"", a martial art that has been learned and originated. Unfortunately, I don’t have Mr. Ma’s contact information. "
1	"I don't know how many times I read the Tao Te Ching, and it seems that there are no words that I don't understand, but I still feel that it is still a peeping reader. Like the metaphor of cultural estrangement, I can understand what to say, but I don’t know what it means. This book is indeed like the title of the book, it is not a big help. Of course, you can't count on reading this book to thoroughly understand your life, but at least you have the opportunity to learn how to open the lock with the help of others. As for the ""Tao"" gate that cannot be entered in the end, it depends on personal luck and talent. I haven't entered yet, but I am very happy. After all, there is still hope to open the door and go in, which is much better than keeping the crack in the door. "
0	"For apartment-style hotels, the expectations are generally not too high, but it is enough. It is a pity that I was extremely disappointed after entering Nanyou. The room is big enough, but the decoration is old-fashioned and low-quality (I lived in a deluxe two-person suite), this hotel is not recommended! ! The most ridiculous thing is the kind of ""package"". I paid an extra 60 yuan to play a few rounds of bowling. When I checked in, I gave me those bowling coupons. The funny thing is that these ""coupons"" cannot be used on Friday, Six and daily use... Oh my god, Ctrip office didn't remind me. I paid 60 yuan for nothing. Although it is not much, the point is that my girlfriend and I are very angry. Should I go to Zhuhai for ""bowling"" on weekdays? I still keep those coupons. I want to see what Nanyou and Ctrip.com have to explain! ! ! Hotel Feedback September 7, 2007: I once again express my deep apologies to you. The hotel sports package includes breakfast coupons and golf coupons or bowling coupons, which can be used on weekdays and holidays. As a new employee was unfamiliar with the bowling alley incident on the day of the incident, he thought you were using other coupons that could not be used on weekends, which caused a misunderstanding. We also failed to understand your discomfort in time. Afterwards, we will review this case specifically to ensure No more similar incidents. To express our sincere apologies to the hotel. Your bowling ticket can be reissued at any time. The hotel provides you with a free luxurious suite for two, and promises to provide you with quality and considerate service. Hope you give us one "
1	Original 3255, 300 volumes + Rising 2009.. Actual price: 2995. More affordable. The screen is relatively large. It's pretty good alone, but it's usually enough. 
1	The appearance is very distinctive. The appearance of the Great Wall obviously does not turn on the lights in the lobby during the day to save electricity. . . It seems that the number of people staying in is a bit small, and the check-in procedure is a bit interesting, what kind of check-in notice and so on. . . 
0	It is troublesome to install XP system. It is troublesome to install XP because it is SATA. I downloaded a clean installation version of windows xp pro sp3 (integrated IE7, WMP11 and PATA, SATA, SCSI, RAID drives) on the Internet and cannot be installed. 
1	Just got this set of books. Each book is very thin, rich in pictures, simple sentences, and each book repeats the same sentence pattern by replacing simple words. This way of learning should not be hard! The CD songs are very interesting, but the piece of music in the first lesson is too long, which makes you inexplicable. The child is 7 years old, is in the first grade, has studied English for four years, and studied in kindergarten. I have developed a sense of language, but I have not memorized the words well. Through this set of books, he should be able to memorize words well. But the price is too expensive, they are all photocopied, and a set costs more than 127 yuan. It can be cheaper to meet China's national conditions. 
1	"The first Anai book I read was ""No Death"". I saw this name accidentally when I was borrowing a book in the library. I wanted to borrow it and show it to my colleagues (he likes reading fantasy books) When there was nothing to do in the office, I found out that the content was not what I thought. I couldn't help but was deeply attracted. Since then, Anai's works have become my favorite. This book also thinks that Anai can have 30 years of experience as workers, farmers, individual industrial and commercial households, overseas students, etc., giving us another 30 years of reform and opening up. Reading it is thought-provoking and worth reading. ,highly recommended! "
0	1. As a portable notebook, it is a bit heavier and thicker. 2. The screen is really too small, and the netbook should still be 12 inches. 
0	The hotel is a couple of students staying on weekends, the noise is really horrible, I found that many students at the front desk price is 120 yuan. The environment and facilities are really bad! Not recommended 
1	A very good book. I have read He Qifang's prose many years ago. It is a small book, but it has endless beauty. I can even recite the sentence above. He can hardly find his books in bookstores now. Fortunately, Dangdang has them here. I have read the prose in this book very well, but for those poems, I will not look away when I fall on it. For real everyone, I hope that many people can experience it together. Women will be more graceful when they read, and men will be more graceful when they read. It is like a curtain that is gently raised, stealing the scenery of that era and the fluctuations in the center of the scenery. 
0	Very bad! ! ! Recommend everyone not to live! The door is open in the alley and can't be found. Every morning you will be woken up by the waiter chatting without an alarm clock! If you don’t declare the long-distance network service provided at the front desk, it is all unavailable, complaints are useless, and the attitude is enough for you to drink a pot. The image of Harbin was destroyed in this way. 
1	I personally think this book is the best book I have ever read. Why is it used in the book, what is the motivation, what background knowledge does it have, and the multiple meanings of a concept, which are used in different scenarios. It is done in this way. I personally think that the translation is not bad. The author of this book is really worthy of being a master. Every time I read a few pages, I feel a lot. That’s a lot of experience. When this book can evoke a lot of your thoughts, I think your purpose of reading has been achieved. If you are still hesitating, then please make a decision. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. It is highly recommended! 
0	: The configuration is good, and the Pentium dual-core feels not bad~ The price is right. Insufficient: It is more troublesome to install the system~ Summary: Good, worth the price 
1	The configuration of the whole machine is balanced, that is, the memory is slightly smaller. If Jingdong can send another memory, it will be perfect^_^ The appearance of the notebook is very beautiful, and I especially like its keyboard design. The LED screen display effect is very good, the color is very real without the illusion of the conventional screen. 
0	The operating system is the DOS version! No other problems have been discovered yet. The original gift package is in the box, please indicate it! 
0	Helped a foreign colleague to book a room for one night. When it arrived, the order was cancelled because of the traffic jam. But the hotel lobby did not contact me who made the reservation through ctrip, but recommended other hotels nearby. Because it was already eight o'clock in the evening, the guest had no choice but to let the hotel's arrangements, and finally found him a nearby three-star hotel, but the price actually cost more than 1,600 yuan. What was even more exaggerated was that the order status showed that it had been completed, so I didn't know about it for several days. I didn't know this until my colleague sent an email to complain after returning to China. It feels like being hacked. There is nothing wrong with the order being cancelled, but the hotel’s approach is too improper. After complaining to ctrip, I made a call and made the matter clear. As for the order showing the transaction, the explanation was an operating error. The company used ctrip for some hotel reservations for several years before, but it will not be used again after this incident. It's so irritating. 
0	Can this book be recommended? The focus is almost always on establishing a good image for oneself by saying good things and self-defense about a certain lawsuit. It is good to have money, and you can publish a book like this 
1	It’s cheap, cost-effective, and I gave it so many things. Haha, the installation system is very convenient. Just change the hard disk transfer to IDE, and you can install it directly. It’s super simple, haha, it looks better than expected, or samsung Perfect screen, good good 
0	Carmela is a brave chick, simple and persistent, I like it~ my colleague’s baby also likes it~ and I will listen to my boyfriend and I am very devoted~ 
1	Mr. Yang Huaiding wishes you a long and healthy life! Bless your whole family, and wish your grandson (daily limit) healthy and happy! An ordinary Shanghai investor who is deeply moved and admired by you May 7, 2009 
1	Balanced configuration, strong performance, exquisite workmanship, and good heat dissipation. Abundant accessories. There is also an original Dell mouse pad. My colleagues are very satisfied. 
0	There is no storyline, all the protagonists are narrating, the relatives around him have died one by one, but he is still alive! It's so exhausting! Can't stand novels with such themes! 
0	"But there is no partition. Moreover, the VISTA logo is posted on the computer, and the XP system is installed. I checked from the computer that the graphics card is an integrated ATI HD3400, but when I asked the customer service, the customer service only replied ""This computer is a discrete graphics card"", I don't know what the problem is. The board at the power switch is a bit convex upwards. "
0	It's not that I don't like it, but the content of the story is too chaotic, giving people a sense of complexity. Since my personal literary accomplishment has not reached a certain level, my personal evaluation is: average! 
0	It may be because the hotel is relatively old, the rooms look very average and the facilities are relatively average. 
0	Everyone is advised not to stay in this hotel, which is known as a four-star standard, but the items in the room are very resistant, especially the towels, which are not as good as business hotels such as Home Inn and Jinjiang Inn. After living in, it is really fooled, except for the sea view. The scenery in the room is fair, but the others are really unsatisfactory. I checked in at the end of April and the room was very cold. I called to ask the hotel. The answer to me was that there is no warm air now. Let me cover the bed with more quilts. You said it was ridiculous. laugh? 
1	Support as always, good hotel, just a little bit more service. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you for your long-term care and support for our hotel. Our hotel is about to declare a four-star hotel. While we are transforming the hardware, we also strengthen and upgrade the software services, and strive to make every All guests are satisfied. The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to five-star standards, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
0	It’s not as good as the four-star standard and there is no massage, but there is hot water someday 
0	Four-star hotels, I will not mention the places that meet the standards. They have the following shortcomings: 1. The standard room does not provide free bottled water (the bottled water in the bar is 8 yuan a bottle) 2. It is far from the city and cannot be reached Car, and does not provide car-hailing service 3. Other meals are unknown, breakfast is huge, free registration, website navigation, hotel index service description, about Ctrip is looking for talented agents to cooperate 
0	The temperature is a bit high during operation. There is no computer bag mouse accessories, and the power connector is black and does not match the white machine. If you remember correctly, Lenovo has a white power cord. 
1	This time I stayed at the hotel's network is not very stable, intermittent, I hope to improve. 
1	Hmm, I wrote it, except for some materials that are not easy to buy, it is really a good book. 
1	We arrived in Qingdao at more than one o’clock in the night. The hotel arranged a free airport pick-up. The hotel’s service began from then on. When we got on the locomotive, the driver handed us disinfection towels and mineral water. It was cool, when the car was approaching the hotel, the driver informed the hotel that the guests would arrive immediately. The car entered the hotel and stopped directly in front of the door of the room where we were staying. The waiter had already been waiting here, opened the door for us, and sent us in. The room immediately sent two glasses of juice and told us that it was too late. In order not to affect our rest, we will check in tomorrow. The VIP building we stayed in was newly renovated. We booked the North Room. It was arranged on the first floor. The facilities in the room were good. The beds and beddings were all standard enough to sleep well this night. The next day during the day, when there was a small decoration sound, LG gave some comments. The hotel immediately changed the room and upgraded it to a sea-view room on the 4th floor. The hotel’s open-air seawater swimming pool normally starts at 10 o’clock. LG has the habit of swimming in the morning. The waiter in the swimming pool said that you only need to greet you when you come. LG was very happy. I also made an exception and did not sleep late, so I went for a morning swim. After having dinner at the hotel, LG coughed a few times in the dining room. The waiter in the restaurant immediately delivered a white fungus soup, and then delivered cough lozenges. It is really rare to see such meticulous care. Everywhere in the hotel, every hotel employee I see smiles sincerely to you, making people feel like this is a big family, everyone in the family is very friendly, and our hearts are smiling. From many subtle points, it reflects the management level of the hotel. From the hotel employees we contacted, we saw their love for the hotel. It is really rare to be proud of working in this hotel. Among the hotels we have stayed in, this hotel impressed us deeply with its first-class service, first-class smile, and first-class management, and it is none other than Qingdao in the future. 
0	Black shop! An out-and-out black shop! 10,000 Hong Kong dollars and more than 2,000 renminbi were stolen in the hotel. After the report was reported, the police sent a surveillance video to the defendant and told that the one facing my room was broken, and my room was the only one without cleaning records that day. Moreover, the hotel does not intend to compensate the guests for any harm caused by their negligence. It is recommended that you choose to stay at this hotel carefully. If you have to stay at this hotel, please take your money and valuables with you (because the hotel does not have a safe). Additional comments November 15, 2007: Six months have passed, the police, the hotel, No one at Ctrip gave an explanation. Today, Ctrip called to say that the hotel requested to delete this review, which is unreasonable! ! The review I posted is completely in accordance with Ctrip's requirements, it is true and objective, it is just a warning to friends who book this garbage hotel to be careful not to repeat my mistakes, so that my loss of more than 10,000 yuan It was not in vain. I hope that Ctrip can treat this issue from the customer's standpoint. Feedback from the hotel on November 19, 2007: The hotel actively cooperated after receiving the report of the lost property from the guest, and assisted the guest to investigate the incident together with the police at the first time. The police inquired about the guest’s housing access record and the result showed that the recording system It shows that there was no room attendant in and out of the room cleaning records on that day, but all the records of the guest's own room card access, and since the hotel opened, the front desk has been equipped with a safe, and the guest said that there is no safe, which is inconsistent with the actual situation of the hotel! The police confirmed that the shop was not responsible for this matter. 
0	The pre-installed vista system is only divided into two areas, which is too unreasonable. It was originally an advantage but now it has become a defect. 
0	do not know why. My daughter just doesn't like this book. She always ran away when we watched together. It seems she doesn't like this kind of illustrations and messy style. I don't like such books either. The picture is not very realistic. I don’t even know how to teach her many English words. Maybe it is more suitable for children from abroad. 
1	After reading this book, no, it should be after reading this letter. I think this is more suitable because it is relatively short. It gives people the feeling that they should eagerly pursue their dreams when they are young, as long as you want it very, very very much. If you get it, you have to pursue it and work hard, even if it is unfair, even if it seems a little unreasonable (the poet goes to study economics), those unfairness will be insignificant and unreasonable in the future. Things can actually be done, and even done very well. I hope the author can write something more detailed to young people, that would be even better, I look forward to it! 
1	Hewlett-Packard’s commercial laptops are still very cool, and this b-series laptop is no exception. The appearance is simple, silver gray, I like it very much. The workmanship is exquisite and the screen is perfect. 
0	I don’t know how Ctrip negotiated with the hotel. Obviously, staying for two nights was 248, the hotel had to charge our colleagues 275! So I played an arc to coordinate this matter between Ctrip and the hotel. The hotel said that the sales department was not working and dizzy. If the sales department was not working, please stop opening a shop! ! Although the hotel made a compensatory plan with the efforts of Ctrip, after all, such encounters are really uncomfortable. In fact, we usually live here when we go to Chongqing, and there is no particular disappointment. However, it seems that the hotel's small mistakes do give consumers a very uncomfortable feeling. I think this is not accidental for Fortune, and I hope that Fortune will continue to improve. 
0	But it is too heavy, the screen effect is average, the sound is average, and the volume is OK. The display on the screen is not scattered well, it is not as good as the THINKPAD, 16:10 screen. Bag? Is it broken? 
0	"When I saw the title of the first book ""I Want to Watch the Sea"", I thought it was very cute, and then I found the content to be quite imaginative, haha, yes, it should stimulate the imagination of children~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ "
1	The service attitude is really good and makes people feel comfortable. When I checked out, I was told that there was a piece of clothing forgotten in the room. I wanted to go back to get it, but they insisted on letting the waiter bring it for me. Everyone who enters and exits the hotel will smile at you, bend over and nod in greeting. I personally like the surrounding environment, the feeling of a small town. There are several shortcomings. One is that the floor is too low, it seems to be only 4 floors. We live on the first floor, which feels very strange. Second, the soundproofing of the room is not good, and I always hear people talking outside the window. Other hotels usually have taxis waiting in front, but here you have to go outside to take a taxi. 
0	There is no pre-installed system, and the motherboard BIOS has not entered the SLIC certificate, so the OEM version of VISTA cannot be activated, causing VISTA to be unusable. I have changed several versions of VISTA and the activation tool and I have not won VISTA. I will try again. Please also advise from friends who have successfully installed VISTA. 
1	Actually, women, why do you marry? love? money? marry? For love, even I can't convince myself of this reason. The older I get, the less I believe it. For money, there are so many rich people, besides, others may not look down upon you. In order to get married, everyone around you gets married, and you are left alone. You must get married. This is sociality. I think that heroine is really brave. Because she met Chen Mingran, not An Jiahe. 
0	To a certain extent worse than a good two-star or no-star hotel 
0	If you don’t have a driver, you need to download from the official website if you want to install it. 
0	I am currently in high school and my English scores are pretty good. This book is said to be a university-level vocabulary, but most of it is vocabulary from high school textbooks. (I am in the new curriculum reform class) If it is really something college students want to buy I don't think it is necessary. You should know all the vocabulary in it. This book should be more suitable for junior high school students. And this book is not as funny as I thought, it's all a cold joke... 
0	The built-in Linix system is okay to access the Internet. If you want to play other functions, you will undoubtedly need to change to XP. I even bought an Apache USB CD-ROM drive for the convenience of installing XP when I ordered it. After delivery, it was found that the USB CD-ROM cannot boot the system CD, and it has been verified that the CD-ROM can read and write normally. 
0	Very dissatisfied with this hotel, not worthy of 5 stars. First, the room attendant was not competent, the room card had a problem, and no one came out to open the door after 20 minutes. Second, the electric switch tripped... It took 15 minutes for someone to come up. Thirdly, the waiters are impolite and speak outrageously, and some receptionists at the front desk do not understand the operation at all. Fourth, and the most dissatisfied, is that as a 5-star hotel, the taxi drivers at the door randomly charge the price, we are like a fish being slaughtered... We said the price is too expensive, they even said that the price is 5 stars After the class comes out, bargaining will affect our identity.. What is the reason? We can't find a car... This is the first time I have encountered such a 5-star hotel in my stay, and there is such a lack of standard facilities. Rubbish........... Additional comments on December 10, 2007: The bed is too shameful. When I sleep, the mattress can feel the spring wire... I feel uncomfortable sleeping 
1	Cui Ya's sensibility and life experience are perfectly combined with Ken's rational and theoretical thinking, showing us a real and difficult life of pain, their inner difficulties and beauty. I have read this book more than three times one after another. Before and after I started to learn Vipassana meditation, I kept finding time to read this book. It revealed the differences between the two people in rationality, psychology and spirituality. Very deep experience and discovery on the level, as well as continuous self-liberation and growth. I am deeply inspired and deeply moved. Recommend to all friends. May we grow and be free from the temper of life. 
0	Quite bad, I really don't know how the hotel was upgraded to five stars. After the star rise, the price is still longer, but the service is getting worse and worse. It is recommended that the National Tourism Administration re-evaluate it, otherwise it will gain some benefit. If there are other newly built 4, 5 star hotels in Liuzhou, it is estimated that few people will live here 
1	It is indeed the best hotel on the mountain, the environment and facilities are very good. We stayed in Shuguang Villa 7201 room this time. The other villas are row of bamboo houses, four rooms in a row. Our room is separate and cemented, so it is relatively soundproof. There are 3 such rooms in the villa area. The facilities are complete, there are hair dryers, the water is quite hot, and there is no air conditioning, but it is only 18 degrees at night on the mountain, and air conditioning is not needed. We went to Huangshan two days before the Olympics. The weather was fine, so the room was still dry, the bathroom was a bit damp, there were 2 down jackets and a covered quilt. The meal was not eaten in the hotel, so I cannot comment. The service is not bad and the action is fast. 
1	1. Cost-effective, can run the game smoothly. 2. High order processing efficiency. 3. Fast logistics. 
0	Very bad, we had an unbearable anniversary. .com/thread-1368750-1-2.html Additional comment January 30, 2008: .com/thread-1368750-1-2.html 
0	On August 19, 2008, my husband and son and I stayed at the Wuyi Tea Garden Hotel. The air conditioning in the room was insufficient. We opened the windows for ventilation. (The windows are sliding windows and cannot be locked after opening.) The environment outside the windows is extremely poor, and there are garbage dumps everywhere. Pile of stones. At 7 am on the 20th, my shoulder bag and husband's watch were stolen. The police filed a case for the thief to climb the window and steal. This has caused my whole family to suffer a lot of financial and mental losses (I will never dare to live on the first floor of the hotel again, a painful lesson! I still think with horror. Fortunately, there is a lot of cash in the wallet. If the thief can't steal the money, the dog will jump over the wall. , The safety of my whole family...). It can be seen that the quality of security work in a hotel that allows thieves to enter the room is quite poor, and the personal safety of guests is constantly threatened. Moreover, when we discovered the theft and reported it to the main station, the security guards were late to the scene, and we had to call the police ourselves. This experience made me wonder about the folk customs of Wuyishan, and I was not satisfied with the hotel's service, and I was angry at the attitude of some middle and high-level managers (we repeatedly emphasized that our guests should be responsible for being stolen). This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and the worst tour I have ever experienced! 
1	After learning, I found that not all of them are the same as the notes, just like the previous chapters 
1	The appearance is beautiful, very cute, suitable for girls, and the configuration is very high, the initial experience feels very comfortable and fast! The keyboard touchpad is also very good, feel comfortable to touch! 
1	It is more cost-effective and affordable. In the current financial crisis, it is a good choice for those with tighter hands. The driver is relatively easy to find, there is an XP driver in the disk. There is software in the CD-ROM. Everyone can try. 
0	There is no pre-installed system, which is really a bit troublesome! Heat dissipation is a problem. After a long time, the left half of the keyboard will be hotter, but it is stable. 
1	Small, beautiful, large keyboard, good portability, battery life is okay, although it did not reach the advertised 8 hours, but 6 hours is not bad 
1	"In recent years, there is rarely a good book that I can finish reading at once. The thought journey of Teacher Zhao's life is thrilling to read. I really like the large-scale framework of ""Astronomy, Geography, Humanities and Divinity"" proposed by Mr. Zhao. Having such a broad cognitive field and owning its own science, art, and philosophical religion can indeed make life full and happy. The heaven and the earth, the rebellious journey of all things, the time, the passer-by of a hundred generations, the life is like a dream, and it is a joy, I believe this book is worth reading for every reader who seeks to enrich the inner world. "
1	Small and light, Lenovo brand warranty service is trustworthy. Comes with XP Home Edition system, with operating system recovery disk and driver CD inside. 
1	The book has been received, it seems that the words are a bit small, hey, but the content in the book is almost the same as what I saw on the Internet, hehe, I thought that there could be as much extra content as good words and freehand brushwork, haha 
1	The room is clean and tidy, there is a computer to play games and surf the Internet :-) The air conditioner is a bit loud, and everything else is fine. All the charge items in the room have price tags on them, which is fair! My mobile phone charger plugs are of different standards. The room service has delivered the charger and the adapter, which is very efficient. The breakfast buffet is also good. Just near the old town of Suxi Road, the surrounding area is a bit messy. 
0	The panel is prone to fingerprint traces. After the memory is expanded, the BIOS must be upgraded to display 2G and there is no introduction in the manual. 
1	As an old four-star hotel, the rooms are still very tidy and pretty good. The airport pick-up service is very good, you can check in in the car to save time. 
0	Why am I buying an old book? There was a lot of random writing on it, and the CD was wrong. I bought Business English, and the CD is for Life English. What kind of broken B stuff does Dangdang sell! The staff grew up eating S? 
0	The edge of the plastic shell of the display is damaged. Is it because there is no store to sell, so the product is waiting for foreign products! 
0	The bag sent is relatively ordinary, and the workmanship is not good. It is the same as the Toshiba notebook bag at 99 yuan on the mall. I hope I can send a better bag. 
0	The son holds these books by himself, and laughs when he looks at it. This can be said to be the first book that made him so happy. 
0	Integrated graphics, playing Call of Duty 5 and other demanding games compared to cards, no HD output, the materials used are not as strong as the previous old models 
1	Called 4 stars, it's a bit far-fetched, but the Korean cuisine under the hotel is OK, as well as singing and dancing, which is really good. If you want to feel the Korean style, you can still try it. 
0	The hotel's service is simply not good and ranked first! The first day I stayed at 1702, the room leaked. Adjusted to room 1710 the next day! The air conditioner in this room is broken! Woke up in the middle of the night. On the third day, I adjusted to room 1107, which was obviously much smaller than rooms 1702 and 1710, and the room was not able to access the Internet. I was tortured and had no energy to adjust the room. I want to lie in bed and watch TV, my goodness! Can't see it! In short, I am quite satisfied with the service of Ctrip. I am particularly dissatisfied with the room service provided by Xinhu City Hotel in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province! I hope that Ctrip can think about its franchise hotels. How can we trust a brand like Ctrip? Overall I am very depressed! Also very sad! 
1	"Checked in on October 19, 2007, the overall feeling is good, the location is quiet, the ""Qiaoxiangyuan"" rice noodle is diagonally across from the hotel, the room facilities are good, the service is good, the Nanjiang bathing beach at the entrance is good and cheap, breakfast can only be said Passable. But the bed is not very comfortable and will ring when you turn around. "
0	Stayed in a double bed room on the 12th floor on October 2nd. The room is too small and the soundproofing is poor. No. 3 is replaced by a double room on the 11th floor. The drain pipe in the shower room is clogged and the water is flooded. The engineering staff will handle it in the middle of the night (hard work!). Another breakfast There are a lot of stains on the tablecloths. Fortunately, the bedding is clean enough, otherwise I doubt it is a four-star hotel 
1	The LED screen is bright, and the viewing angle is large (the viewing effect below is not good). Lighter. The new adapter, small. The keyboard feels good. HDMI room temperature is 25 degrees, normal application, CPU is about 50 degrees, hard disk is about 45 degrees, heat dissipation is acceptable. The camera is clear. Smooth playback at 720P and 1080P. The price is not high. 
1	"I bought several books at once, which counted as a Children’s Day gift for my child. I was worried that more books would not be good for the child, so I took two books home first <Grandpa Henry finds luck> <Who is at the door>. I like it very much and I am very inspired. Like Grandpa Henry, I have also found many lucky things in my life. Originally I proposed to write the names of her and my brother in the place of ""Give me the most beloved xxx"", which counts as a gift to them She was unwilling to present the two gifts at first. After reading <Who is at the door>, she agreed to write her brother's name before finishing the book. A good book has more influence on the child than me. Preaching. "
0	The hotel is relatively old, the rooms are not big, there is a smell. Breakfast is average. The room rate is not cheap! In short, it is average. 
0	The rest of the book is very good. The binding is wrong! Fortunately, this book was printed by the printing house of Jiaotong University, so I went to change it again. I hope that the manufacturer will pay attention when shipping to others in the future! 
0	I have benefited a lot from watching Too Dan's video of interpreting the Analects, and I want to buy a book to collect. Obviously, the submission was successful, but the goods did not arrive, very depressed... 
1	I have bought it for a while, and I have been using a very good new system rebuilt with a USB flash drive. The machine runs quickly and is stable. 
1	The performance configuration fully meets their needs, and the LED display is more power-saving and enhances the standby time. 
0	The keyboard is too crowded. It’s not very comfortable to press, and it’s easy to press the wrong keys. But this volume can only be this way 
1	I ordered this book for my children, but I read it before my children. If this novel is a children's work, it only describes the life and struggle of individuals under the ravages of fascism in a childish tone. Adult reading From this book, you can feel more about the ravages of war on humans and the power of life. Children reading this book will not only be attracted by the storyline, but more importantly, they will learn courage, wit, and kindness. And strong. In addition to thanking the author, I also want to thank the translator of this book. Such vivid and fluent language makes people have the urge and surprise to finish reading. 
1	The price is good. No Express slot. The keyboard has short keystrokes and feels hard. The graphics card is much worse than the desktop graphics card in 2008 
1	Xiaohei is still good~ workmanship is absolutely superb~ performance is also very powerful~ U is very powerful~ memory does not matter, you can add it yourself~ haha~ snapped up, not bad 
1	After reading it, I not only have a new understanding of the reforms that China has been carrying out before and now, but also have new inspiration for the society and the people living in this society. Many things are not controlled by us. The era has created a lot of heroes and also obliterated a lot of people. We live in this era and this society, the most we should learn is to adapt to the times! No matter if you are doing something earth-shattering or living a small life of your own safety, if you want to live well, don't go against the trend of the times! 
1	It was a bit difficult to find when I first went, but the service is really good~~ and magnificent~~! Although the room is not big but I must be enough to live alone, it is very comfortable and the sea view and ships outside the window~~ hey... On Seafood Street, Queen’s Road is not far away. Traffic is actually very convenient in Hong Kong. There is a tram at the door of the hotel. You can go to the MTR station or directly to Mong Kok in Central.. Not going out. There is a great potsticker that is delicious and cheap~~recommend! Next time I have a chance, I will consider staying here.! Additional comment July 24, 2008: There is air conditioning! You can adjust the temperature yourself! 
1	The appearance continues ibm's usual style, and the keyboard is also very comfortable. The overall response is good, especially after adding 1g of memory. 
1	This book brings people a lot of thinking, even if it is not oneself or the family around him who is facing death, it is still a good book worth reading. Although this book is based on the Christian faith, there are still many things in the book that can help people without religious beliefs. For example, he mentioned that when a person is facing death, what he most hopes for is more love. This reminds me that maybe we cannot alleviate the fear of death for elderly grandparents, but we can care for them more and let them Every day in the world will not feel lonely. 
0	XP is extremely difficult to install, and the delivery speed is so slow that I can’t tell. After making countless customer service calls, I said to deal with it immediately, and it took a few days to send it to me. 
1	I lived in a river-view room, the room was large, the environment was first-rate, and the price was not high (258 yuan for 2 breakfasts). The disadvantage is that the service is a little bit unable to keep up, and it is generally good. 
1	The rooms are much larger than those in Zhongzhou Crown, and the service is okay; the breakfast is too inferior and there are too few varieties. In addition, the room decoration needs to be improved in terms of details, especially the wooden decorations such as door frames, which are really not like the 5-star level. 
1	I lived in a deluxe standard room, the room is not big, the facilities are okay, LCD TV, at the same time as a computer monitor, but the design has a problem, it is not convenient to use, and the wireless keyboard is not easy to use. Overall, I haven't stayed in other hotels, I can't comment on the value for money. Breakfast is average, revolving restaurant, less choices. 
0	"This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room smells unpleasant. I just took the anti-mosquito lotion and changed three rooms. The waiter said: ""After staying for a long time, I get used to it. Every hotel has its own taste. .""test! I'm not here to experience life. The surrounding environment is complex, dirty and messy. "
1	The rare independent graphics card in the 12-inch notebook, upgrade to 2G memory, no problem with ordinary 3D games, such as MOW, FOW, Hero Company, etc., COD4 needs to turn off all special effects, or it will get stuck. It feels very good value and cost-effective. 
0	The words are large and the content is not enough. I bought it when I saw that everyone’s comments were good, but in fact it was not so good, and I feel that the depth is not enough. If you are still hesitating to buy this book, then choose a better one I think this book is really not good in similar books 
0	I went to the Zhongguancun headquarters to pick up the goods, but went to the Asian Games Village again. The service staff in the Asian Games Village had a bad attitude! ! ! I am a novice and cannot install the system! Let the helper pretend, say no matter, I was depressed for a long time, and finally let my colleague help me do it! ! The training of personnel should be strengthened! ! ! 
0	Let me reiterate: I can’t believe the Ctrip operator’s recommendation, I want everyone to read the comments! The operator said this is a quasi-four-star, but it is only a quasi-three-star. In Zhangjiajie, a hot tourist city but a chaotically managed place, I made do with it all night--- Because other parts of our team are also unfamiliar. 
0	I thought it was a story book for children to read aloud, but it was for adults to reason. The price is not low and the title does not match. Regret it 
1	The hotel is on a small street, it is not very easy to find, but fortunately there are many enthusiastic compatriots in Beijing~ The hotel facilities are similar to the ones introduced, the rooms are small, really small, but with the low price factor, it is not worth the money; the environment is good , In the small alley, quiet and tidy, with sufficient heating -_-||. . . Ha, another big advantage is that starting from the hotel, you can walk to Mei Lanfang's former residence in less than ten minutes, etc. The small alley of Beijing flavor is so close to Beihai. In short, not bad. Recommend to friends who save money on self-guided travel~ More cost-effective, there are many special snacks nearby~ 
1	I think the advantages of this manual: 1. The format is small, hardcover, and easy to carry. 2. The hand-drawn drawings are accurate and meticulous. The bird's various postures, adult, sub-adult, winter feather, breeding feather, male and female are basically available. 3. Practical, avoiding boring academic descriptions, with a clear brief introduction and focusing on the identification of bird species. Disadvantages: 1. The lack of Latin names makes it difficult to look up bird species. 2. There is no bird name list. Generally speaking, it is good, and it makes up for the lack of detailed bird illustrations. It is recommended for bird watching beginners. 
1	"A must for Xixia’s enthusiastic followers. It can be used as a reference book. It’s very good. After all, Russia has too many materials and objects in the study of Xixia. We can’t see most of the things in China. Compare domestic research literature. Reference reading is very rewarding! The bibliographic system is clear, the information is informative, and it is very convenient to find and use... What I like most is the last quite a lot of Xixia characters, which can basically be used as a small dictionary for Xia and Chinese translation. It feels very worthwhile! After all, the ""Xia Han Dictionary"" of the year cost 1,000 yuan, and it is not available now! ! ! "
0	Very annoying, I feel fooled, the cover is sealed with plastic paper, there are many writers, celebrity names, and many comments on it. I thought it would look good, so I can’t wait to open it, but~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ This book can only be said to be average!!! It does not deserve to be recommended by so many writers and celebrities!! However, the quality of the book is good, the paper is good, and the printing is OK. The cover feels comfortable to the touch. But. The content is not good, and I don’t like the paper no matter how good it is!!!! 
0	I expressed my opinion a few days ago, but it was deleted by Dangdang staff. I won't say anything more, I just want to say one more thing: this book is really not worth reading, the writing is plain, the plot is contrived ~ so many celebrity recommendations, I can only say that the publisher is amazing! ! 
1	It's for the smoking and non-smoking areas again! I always said no at the beginning, but I can still find it in the end. I really don't understand. Hotel feedback July 8, 2008: Your valuable comments have been highly valued by our hotel management. We have strengthened our attention to the needs of guests for smoking and non-smoking rooms from the reservation to the front desk. But if the hotel room is special When you are nervous, the hotel can only make smoking rooms smoke-free, please understand! Welcome you to continue to stay in our hotel next time! 
0	The scenery around the resort is good, but it is more rural. The hardware is too poor, and the service standard needs to be improved! During the rounds, the old cigarette butts were used to scald people. Although it did not succeed, it left a bad feeling. Just go. 
1	Very nice hotel, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with a large forest inside. It is good to take a walk. It is also a good choice to sit by the lake and have a rest. The room is very quiet, the room facilities are very good, and the waiter's attitude is also very good. 
0	I generally feel that the design is rough, the location of the shortcut keys does not feel good, and the U port on the right side of the mouse is lower (below the optical drive), which is difficult to use. It is difficult to modify the XP system because of the new product. You need to download it from the Hong Kong homepage. drive 
0	The design of the hinge is not good, the gap is large after closing the screen, and it deforms when you grasp it, you can only grasp the front side 
0	I was very dissatisfied with the hotel and made a noise in the end. After checking in, I booked a 3-day stay. On the last day, I got up at 5 o'clock in the morning to catch the flight. I learned that breakfast would only be available after 6 o'clock, so I took the initiative to return the meal coupons they gave me early, but the bill was printed After I came out, I found that the breakfast money for the last day was still included in it, which was very strange. My answer is very simple, just can’t refund! Ask the reason, saying that the computer system is designed in this way. At the beginning of the day, the breakfast fee and the room fee are included. Therefore, even if there is no consumption, it cannot be refunded. If the guest wants to complain, please complain! I have never encountered a hotel with such poor service in 10 years of business trip. It treats customers savagely and charges indiscriminately. There was no explanation before, and there was no explanation on the meal coupon. I was suffocated! Internet access in the room is very expensive, 18 yuan an hour, that’s not counting, you can’t connect to the Internet, you suspect it is a network cable problem, please re-issue a network cable from the reception, saying that you must go to the reception to get it. Back to the hotel, the clothes, pants, and shoes have been changed. Is it appropriate for guests to go to the reception desk like this? Is it the service of a four-star hotel? I told them that a few waiters came and watched for a long time. They restarted my computer for some reason without my consent, and finally said that I should go down and get the network cable by myself. I fainted! The following shopping malls said that they can be settled into the room rate, but in reality, the places where I bought maps and biscuits told me that they had to pay in cash. I was angry and didn't buy anything. The one who sells things only plays games, not letting me find the goods by myself. . . In the future, I will not stay in this hotel. After coming out, the taxi driver said that the service and management of this hotel are notoriously poor in Beijing. 
0	"Have never watched this TV show. I only know that many media have said that it has high ratings and good-looking books. I bought this book for this. I have watched it one third now. To be honest, it feels average. Maybe it's because I'm used to reading works that usually take outstanding people as the protagonists. I always feel that this book does not attract me very well. Looking at the plot, I was anxious for this character, thinking ""How can he be so stupid?"" I hope the next half will surprise me. "
0	XP sound card driver is a big problem. I bought it in 4799, but I didn’t give it anything. Now 4599 is still giving a gift package, I feel so bad. 
0	A hotel full of copper smell. Oxygen is charged at 90 yuan per hour. Check in, directly deduct the room charge for 2 days, and claim that if it is less than 2 days, no refund. The hot water tap comes out very slowly. Related questions, the front desk asked three questions. 
1	It was very good, and the breakfast was very satisfactory to me. I would choose this hotel if I had the opportunity to go there 
0	Explain. I am about Dangdang. Not this book! After I purchased the book. After the payment, Dangdang is out of stock. The transaction is closed. But it has been almost a month later!!! It should be mine The money has not been returned. It adds up to almost 10 orders. More than 300 yuan!!!. I am going to vote 315. 
0	The duty manager (female) on September 23 was amazing! I arrived at the hotel at 3:57 in the morning due to flight reasons. I booked the island at 8 o’clock (the earliest arrival time for Ctrip) and entered the hotel room with the permission of the waiter. At that time, I did not ask for an additional fee and charged me 500. deposit. At noon the duty manager (female) suddenly called my room and said that I had to pay another day’s fee. I argued for reasons and told her that your waiter should be obliged to inform her. If you say in advance, I agree, you It's not too much to collect! She even said that she couldn't tell you clearly and hung up my phone. Later, I asked the waiter of the day to call my room. After my questioning, he also admitted that it was his mistake and was willing to bear my loss. I immediately contacted the duty manager, but she actually said that this is what I handled and it has nothing to do with him, you must pay. I immediately asked to check out (at 9 o'clock at the time), and she actually said that you will also charge you for a day and a half of the room if you refund now. She also said that this is a hotel regulation, I said you showed it to me, and she actually answered me that it was confidential. I went downstairs and left the room. I asked for her name and told her that I want to complain to you. She actually said that I didn't need to tell you my name, I was the manager! Bull. Such a service attitude turned out to be the management staff, and one can imagine what kind of attitude her management staff will serve customers! Additional comment October 4, 2006: This hotel is really beyond words to describe. I still hope that you take care of your wallet so that you don’t know what's going on after being charged! The best way everyone is not to live, otherwise you won’t know what you are paying for! Please tell me more! 
1	"Every child is as simple as an elf. ""Absolute Kid"", ha ha, a book I love. Perhaps it is related to age. Now seeing some words and pictures like this makes it easy and pleasant. Will make my heart suddenly return to that scene when I was a child. Those people, those things, quietly emerged. This is a very strange feeling. Maybe. The fun of innocence does not necessarily have to be age-related. But, for ourselves, keep an optimistic attitude and face everything. It is rare. I think. As long as we want. At any time, you can just be a child. "
0	The temperature of the heat sink is quite high, but I have touched it, the bottom temperature is OK, maybe the heat is basically dissipated in time, the system disk is not attached, and the system needs to be clean, otherwise it will not be installed, and there is no XP drive disk. Go up and down from the Samsung website. But there is a VISTA driver. 
0	To tell the truth, the writing is not very good, it’s a piece of cake, the protagonist’s psychological quality is still a psychologist, it’s really amazing. 
0	I haven't found out yet, but the scheduled time made me wait too long, and it took a week for the order to arrive. I am dizzy! 
1	Every time I read this book, I have a feeling of excitement and wonder, so that I am immersed in thinking and aftertaste for a long time, and I can't calm down for a long time. China’s thirty years of changes have been earth-shaking, and there are too many grief, feelings, and excitement... The author’s knowledge reserves, cultural heritage, as well as the high degree of view of affairs and the true and accurate textual narration of Wu Xiaobo’s author have given China more than 30 years The historical review adds a lot. This book is very worth reading. 
0	This hotel is terrible. There are 3 large entertainment venues on the left, right and back. The noise is noisy until 3 o'clock in the morning. The sound insulation of the hotel is very poor. The decoration of the room is very vulgar, and the central air-conditioning sound is very loud. Hotel Feedback July 15, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for your valuable comments on this hotel. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to you during your stay in this hotel. As for your air conditioning problem, our hotel management attaches great importance to it. We will immediately find professionals to improve the air conditioning problem. We will continue to improve our shortcomings in the future. To provide you and all guests with better service, thank you again, and look forward to your next visit, thank you! 
0	The hotel business is light, and there are not many guests in the lobby. The room is not small, but I feel that the bedding and curtains are all grey and smelly. Recreational facilities in the hotel, including swimming pool, billiards, etc., are charged. There is no air conditioning in the room during the day. The hot water at night will not come until it is left for 10 minutes. The advantage is that the location is good, it is the old street when you go out, and it is convenient for eating and shopping. 
1	"It was because of Chen Danqing’s recommendation when talking about Lu Xun that he paid attention to this book and looked for it. It is indeed very lively and interesting. I should thank Mr. Hu Songping (although he is humble) for recording these wonderful clips for future generations. The last years of life. After passing his records, I realized that ""Hu Shi"" is not just a celebrity who is superior, admired by posterity, or pointed out, but a wise man who is really close to us, a master of flesh and blood. "
0	After reading a few pages, there is no desire to read it. The author has been bragging. After a while, Mrs. So and so has been unable to cure any disease. After he took a look, he took a few medicines, or pressed a few times, and it was cured immediately. Either the doctor has been unable to cure any disease and ask him for help. Regarding the real thing, there is no detailed explanation at all. Bad book~ 
0	Compared with other netbooks, this machine is still a bit expensive. In addition, China has never introduced a high-resolution version, which is a pity. Upgrading the memory requires removing the keyboard, which may be a problem for general users. 
0	"If you are under 18, I suggest you try this book that is liked by some people. I bought it and browsed a page or two and never wanted to look at it again! Tell me about the content of the book. In other words, you can find clues about this book if you find a book stand in the night market and open a book about ""Secrets of Success"" or ""The Art of Interpersonal Relations"". . . In other words, this book is no different from all kinds of popular inspirational books on the market! It is nothing more than dogmatic preaching. For a mature man, these things are completely... "
0	I don’t know if it’s a hard disk or a CD-ROM drive when it starts up. No camera. 
0	I bought 4 books, and after reading the first one, I gave away all of them. I really don't like it. This book has several major drawbacks: 1. The author has been writing about officialdom struggles that intrigue me, swindle and kill people, but unfortunately I have no interest in this. I would rather go to see some more humane things like the secret history of the harem. 2. The narrative sequence is chaotic. At first glance, I realized that it was something written on the Internet, over and over again, and over and over again. After reading it, I couldn't figure out which thing came first and what happened after. 3. Poor writing. The author probably got the true biography of a certain martial arts novelist. His writing is pale, and only countless exclamation marks are unforgettable. I don’t understand why this book is sought after, whether I like its writing style, or the human fighting skills it introduces. The person who asked me for the book said it was for her son who is in high school. , Afraid of misleading children. 
0	The upper left of the keyboard is a little raised between F4-F12, up to 2mm. And the board between the keyboard and the touchpad is a bit deformed, it feels like a crimping line arched (I haven't opened it to see), but it does not affect the use 
1	I went to Wuxi last weekend and saw the recommendations of friends, and I felt pretty good about the friendship I lived there. The overall situation is basically what the previous netizens have said, the surrounding environment of the hotel is average, of course it can't be compared with the scenic area, and it can't be regarded as noisy, the general urban area is probably like this. Fortunately, the hotel is bent inside, so basically it has no effect. There is some convenience on the side of the hotel, Tesco a little further away, and the traffic is very convenient. The bed in the room is harder, the bathroom is smaller, and the computer virus is more powerful, but overall the flaws are not concealed. We stayed in the business room in Building 2. The room was large and clean, and the bathroom was very clean. The service attitude of the hotel is very good, and the check-in and check-out speeds are also very fast. It is especially worth mentioning that the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are very good, at least to our appetite. I heard a local person nearby said this The Wuxi cuisine on the side is very authentic. Is a very cost-effective hotel. 
1	Nothing to say, it's cheap. The quality of the goods I received yesterday is still uncertain. I just installed the XP system today, so it looks like a computer and it is very convenient to use. 
0	HP does not provide a driver for WINDOWS XP. In the HP Forum, there is no corresponding driver for CQ35-105TX. Therefore, if you want to use it in WINDOW xp, it depends on your tolerance. Installing the driver is also a test. No mouse and bag to send, stingy. 
0	Each chick's movements and looks are different, very cute, and his son who likes to paint likes book illustrations very much. The text is very humorous. Our family of three read it together and laughed from ear to ear 
1	I bought a desktop and laptop HP for my friends. The configuration is pretty good and the price is outstanding. HP's big brand, the first choice for more than 4000 yuan! 
1	Needless to say the advantages, who makes us poor and the price is a very attractive factor. I only talk about the shortcomings. After I got it, I found that the fan made a very sharp high-frequency sound, which was very uncomfortable when it was quiet. I disassembled it in a fit of anger. It should be an assembly problem. The fan was running quietly. It was resonating or rubbing with it in other places. I reinstalled it and now it is fine. When the bottom shell is pressed, there will be a clicking sound. After careful observation, it is caused by the bottom shell and the edge of the board. Treat the contact part slightly to solve it. 
1	Although I stayed in a deluxe room, the facilities of the room still looked a bit dated. Early breakfast is not very rich, but I think that for the 50 yuan breakfast in a four-star hotel, I may be too demanding. But the door face of this hotel is back enough. Hidden in a small alley. Fortunately, taxi drivers know it. 
0	There is a gap of about 1 cm between the closing and the front, and the memory is installed by removing the touchpad from the front, which is a bit uncomfortable. 
0	This book is one of the more rewarding books I read in 2008. Some opinions in the book break some of my usual ideas. The author answers certain personal opinions about the confusion that appeared in the twenty-year-old age group. It is worth seeing for girls at this age. 
0	1) The power plug is not tight and easy to fall off; 2) The left and right buttons of the mouse are not sensitive and loose; 3) The heat dissipation is not good, and the system sometimes runs very slowly; 4) There is noisy operation, if the requirements are not high, it is not a problem; 5 ) The surface paint is easy to scratch, and there will be scratches if you don't pay attention. 
0	The notebook shell is the same as that of Shenzhou, which does not reflect the brand. The battery is 4400mAh, the actual battery life is too short, Tongfang is too stingy, the manual is too simple, the driver CD is not, the bag and the mouse are not, even the power cord of the power adapter is shorter than other brands. 
0	We traveled with 7 people and booked 2 standard rooms and 1 triple room. When we checked in to the hotel, we informed that the triple room and the two standard rooms are in two buildings. When the triple room was checked in, we informed that there was a problem with the room. , I also gave us two standard rooms with complete facilities, but the bath water was like muddy water. It took 15 minutes to clean. There was no service staff at the service desk in the building, and the overall feeling was not very satisfactory. 
0	The size is relatively large. Although it is the earliest netbook brand, the texture is still lagging behind that of HP Dell and other brands. The mouse buttons and shortcut keys are very hard to use, and the touch screen can basically be abandoned. 
0	There is no backpack, and there are too few usb ports, only two, and the shared port can’t connect usb devices, ah~~a bit inconvenient 
0	This is the worst 4 star hotel I have ever stayed in-it's definitely not an exaggeration! I booked a suite, but I can enter the room. At first glance, it was decorated in the 1960s. It is completely different from the picture-this is too deceptive! This room costs 448 (without breakfast), which is not worth it. The bathroom is old, it still feels dirty, the bathtub has a feeling that I can't get my feet down, and the whole room has a musty smell. I asked the front desk and said that the other floors have been renovated, but the suites have not been renovated-then why the higher price? ! I really can’t understand how Ctrip would give such an introduction, such a picture and such a price! 
1	Compared with other first-line brands, the price is low, and the configuration is balanced. XP is easy to install, and it is no different from ordinary computers. Give some advice to friends who buy later. Use deep XP, press F2 to enter bois, and set the CD drive to start. /Then install XP is almost the same as usual. Maybe you use ghost more. Regarding the partition installation disk, Microsoft has already brought it, which is very convenient. The key installation CD should bring the driver of the sata port. It is recommended to use depth 6.2 or rain forest, other drivers There are many online, if you can't, check ACER's tai wan website, if you don't understand, PM me. 
1	1. The piano is painted on the outside, and the keyboard is surrounded by alloy and recessed settings, so it is very beautiful! 2. High cost performance! 3. Altec Lansing sound quality is very good! 
0	JD’s couriers are really bad enough. When placing the order, it was stated that they would call before delivery. The phone did not call. The delivery was done during the company’s lunch. Because it was the company’s purchase, the lunch break did not arrive at work, the finances were absent, and checks were not allowed. Open, wait for 5 minutes and get impatient, and even swear bad words, Jingdong still has to grasp the details 
1	A very good book. I bought it with Love Coffee. It is a rare book with content and content in recent years. It is really good and sincere. All the content is meaningful, down-to-earth, and a summary of years of experience. , It’s really a work of hard work, regardless of the suggestions or comments, they are kind, sincere and calm. Very good, very good. I am very grateful to the author. If you are familiar with it, it can be considered as a flaw for most of the experts: some of the photocopied pictures have a little ghosting, which affects the effect a little, but the flaws are not hidden. 
1	The appearance configuration pleases me. The packaging is very good, I bought a 5.12 machine, after testing, the hard disk power-on time is only 1H. Jingdong products can be trusted 
1	The location is good, not too far from the bus station, 15 minutes walk, two minutes by taxi. The quality of the breakfast delivered at the time of booking is not satisfactory, but there are McDonald’s and KFC nearby. The room is wide, clean, but with electrical appliances The plug is a round hole, which is a bit inconvenient. The broadband plug is some distance away from the table, which is not convenient. The attitude of the waiter in the lobby is acceptable, not too cold. The water in the pool is green, not blue, so bad, I dare not enter the water . 
1	I am Yan Geling's loyal follower. From the first time I read about her human world, Female Meadow, about 5 years ago, I started chasing her every book out of control. The themes of her novels can basically be divided into the themes of the Military Cultural Revolution and the themes of foreigners living in the US according to her own life experience. I think a big reason for chasing her novels is that she is very good at telling stories, and metaphors are always refreshing. In this Suizi Story, I like the life of their group of girls in the Writers Association compound the most. Shrouded in the shadow of the crimes of their parents, they still live out their childhood. 
1	As a teacher, I have given this book as a gift to students who have just taken the college entrance examination. I believe it will be inspiring for them. 
1	Looking at the cover of the book, I guessed that my son would like it. As expected, my mother-in-law received the book when it came. I saw it when I was sending my son to school the next day. My son clamored to talk about it. Go to school, let's talk about it in the evening. In the evening, I will talk about it twice, and I will talk about..., but it's too late and it's almost eleven, so I can't talk about it anymore. Some time ago, I went to the pond to catch small tadpoles and asked us to raise them, but we grew thinner and thinner, and the less we raised them. He liked those tadpoles very much. I bought them for the densely packed cute tadpoles, like The same as we saw in the pond. 
0	The service attitude is extremely poor. The receptionist at the front desk seems to be untrained, and does not even understand the basics of courtesy, so he can receive several guests at the same time; the assistant manager in the lobby is even worse, he can't finish defending the guests, and even dare not call the general manager to complain give. If you haven't done anything wrong, don't be so afraid of Ben. 
0	The room is very small, the decoration is too bad, all the wires are exposed outside, dirty, not dirty 
1	The location of this hotel is very good, just near Xinjiekou. The service of the hotel staff is also very good. The supervisor Gu Xinfeng helped me check in at the time, because they were doing the hotel renovation, they helped me upgrade for free! The waiter in the room was also very attentive, and the service after arrival made me very satisfied. The newspaper was also accompanied by a lightly scented flower, which made people feel at home. It is really a recommended hotel. Although I am not a senior member of the coroutine, I have been using coroutine for 3 years. This is the first time I came up to review, because the service is really outstanding. It makes me feel that the money has not been spent wrongly. 
1	The lobby of the hotel is really old and the rooms are ok. The western restaurant for breakfast is better than the previous dining environment. It used to be messy. (In the past, breakfast was served with 2 coupons. Chaos), now it’s much better with the room card. 
1	This book is different from the early education books I have read in the past. It combines the realism of the explanatory text, the sentiment of the prose and the clearness of the atlas. Especially after reading a few pages, you will feel that this is a book you can't put down. The book describes many common life conditions and ways to communicate harmoniously with children under various conditions. The doubts that are not exhaustive and extended from the content of the text are also mentioned later. It feels like a wise book to understand parents. I like it very much! 
0	There is a color dot on the screen, maybe the character is good, where is the upper border, it will not affect the use. Installing the GUOST system is very troublesome, and people who don't know much about computers will have to work hard. It is recommended to install the system after DM is formatted, otherwise there will be a bug. Can't get in 
0	The CPU score of the Vista system is 53, which is slow, and the other scores are relatively high. When the CPU reaches 100%, there is still plenty of memory. The slidebar that comes with Lenovo is not easy to use. Easy to run out of electricity. Easy to bump and leave traces. 
1	The 158 room I stayed in was okay, the room was facing the road at the entrance of the hotel, soundproofing was ok, not noisy. The bathroom was not too small, but the design was not very reasonable, the shower faucet was too powerful, and the water hit the body It all hurts. Overall, it's okay. 
1	Exquisite workmanship, very thin books, comes with MAFEE anti-virus software. The N280's CPU is good and will automatically adjust the frequency as needed. Watching movies with 1280*720 resolution is very smooth 
0	The introduction to the sample page that I saw is the latter part of the book. The first part is boring and not worth so much money. I was fooled. There are so many English learning materials now. It is really a mistake to spend money on such a book. 
0	People live for all the good things, food, beauty, beautiful things...Of course, more important is the beautiful ideals. Too much access to the world is not necessarily a good thing. 
1	The environment is good, the service attitude is very good, the location is also very good, and the traffic is convenient. The price/performance ratio of 198 is quite high, the room decoration is very stylish, there is also an LCD TV, and fruits and newspapers are delivered every day. Because I slept late, I cannot evaluate the breakfast. The total stay is quite satisfactory. Next time to Yinchuan, staying in Ningfeng is definitely the first choice, much more cost-effective than the 180 Home Inn next door. The only fly in the ointment is that the soundproofing is slightly worse in the middle of the night. When I woke up I heard the TV sound in the next room, but this is a common problem of the hotel, and there are minor problems. It would be better if it can be improved. 
0	The payment was successful on May 8th. Dangdang.com showed that it will be shipped on May 10th, but so far I haven’t seen the goods or received any notice. Jane doesn’t know how to say it! ! ! 
1	High configuration, beautiful appearance, and fine picture quality. The touchpad has been bumped and it feels good. The white keyboard is eye-catching. 
1	1. Pure black keyboard, brown outer panel, silver frame, good-looking and good workmanship! ~ 2. Ben Shuang 4200, fast speed, good graphics card, can cope with mainstream games, the LED screen is quite good, the display effect is good, the brightness is high, the new 16:9 wide screen is a bit unaccustomed, it takes a few days to adapt! 3. The delivery speed is very fast. I paid in the afternoon on the 24th. The delivery was completed within 2 hours after the payment was confirmed. The efficiency is high. This is worthy of praise! 4. The customer service is very patient, the bank transfer speed is too slow, I am very anxious, he patiently explained to me! Until the payment is confirmed, thank you comrade. 
0	The sanitation of the room was extremely poor. When registering, the front desk lady ignored them and threatened that they were private owners...how?....After washing their hands, they found that the shoes were wet. After inspection, they found that the pool pipe was exposed. Yes, the water is flowing from the top, and the bottom is flowing out, the windows of the room cannot be opened for ventilation, and the room is extremely dry. A colleague drank mineral water the day before, and the Wahaha plastic label fell on the floor. Two days later, the plastic skin was still left intact at the door after cleaning. I wonder if the waiter was sincere. Didn't see at all that it met the price standard of this accommodation. If it wasn't for the other party's appointment to live here, they wouldn't come here if they were killed. 
0	This hotel is a guest house remodeled, so the hardware facilities are very simple, the key is that the gate is on the second floor, there is no barrier-free stairs, carrying luggage upstairs, and there is no service staff to help! Resting in a residential area at night, I dare not open the window. In short, I am very dissatisfied! 
1	The service is first-rate, the bus at the door extends in all directions, the breakfast is rich, and it is worth living. I went to Xiamen for five days, two days for Jinjiang Inn, two days for Xiamen Hotel, all were good and very satisfied. 
0	"I don’t really like it myself. Just like a parent’s evaluation, it may aggravate the child’s rebellion. The new mantra of my children now is ""XX, XX, always XX, I don’t want XX!"" "
0	There are few USB ports. Painted surfaces are too stained with fingerprints, so you have to bring a cleaning cloth with you. . . O(∩_∩)O haha~ 
1	I just received the unused one today, it should be good. Let’s not waste the evaluation and wait for a period of time before publishing the usage and experience to provide your reference. 
0	The room is too bad, the elevator loves bad, I was almost locked in the elevator and couldn't get out. I was exhausted by climbing to the sixth floor and would never live again. I strongly recommend that you consider other budget hotels, Home Inns are getting worse. 
0	The book was bought for my baby girl who is two years and three months old, and she has no interest in this book. The nine-year-old son also flipped it casually. He usually likes to read different books. 
0	Compared with other netbooks, this machine is still a bit expensive. In addition, China has never introduced a high-resolution version, which is a pity. Upgrading the memory requires removing the keyboard, which may be a problem for general users. 
0	When reading this book, one feels that the author is telling the readers how to do what, in order to prove that what she said is correct, and then give a bunch of examples of women around her from the perspective. The content is very empty, and the speech is pale and weak. It doesn't feel much depth. I regret buying this book and I won't read it for the second time. 
0	Because the sound of most DVDs is not clear at all. Only the first and sixth are good. I regret buying this product now. It seems that pirated stuff is really a chance. 
1	The hotel is far from the city, but there is a shuttle bus to the hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui an hour, the facilities in the room are relatively old, but the external environment is very good, the air is also very good, there is a beach not far from the hotel, which is very suitable for vacation , The breakfast variety is also relatively rich. I will go to live next time, the environment there is really good. For example, the heart hotel is much better. 
0	The content is very ordinary, I don't think there is anything new. And the understanding in some places should not conform to the original intention. Not a book worth buying 
0	1. SONY pre-installed too many software, deleted for a long time 2. The bottom of the heat is big, and it is very hot on the legs 3. The buttons on the touchpad are too hard and noisy 4. The power indicator is too dazzling 5. This mode switch The function is too tasteless 
0	The display is too bad, there are ripples when the signal is switched, the delay is high and the smear is obvious, the touchpad is extremely bad, I dare to say that 99% of people will go crazy if they use the touchpad for a day 
1	ThinkPad brand is quite worth buying; thin and light, superior performance; delivery is quite fast, place an order at 10 pm and arrive at 3 pm the next day, Jingdong's service is still good, praise it. 
1	Used to play high-definition, using hdmi to connect to the TV, the effect is really good, haha. Try it as a BT machine in the future 
0	When can I receive it, it really doesn't work, I will return it and order it again, and it will be delivered to my door. I send someone's birthday book, the birthday is over, and the book has not come yet. 
1	Hee hee, I wrote a review before the book arrived, but I tell you a little secret, I didn't watch the ending! 
0	I have just been working for more than a year. After reading this book, I really feel a lot of things that I don’t understand at work, and I have strengthened my belief in my heart. A very good book! 
1	The overall feeling is good, and it is enough for general use. It’s easy to install the system. Go to the BIOS and change ahci to ide, and then set the CD-ROM drive to boot (this is not the same as the original one, press F5 or F6 under boot to adjust the second item CDDVDW to the first one), I used The tomato garden is installed directly. You can install the drivers one by one with the provided CDs 
0	"My colleague and I have booked the ""Wudu Hotel"" for one night. We will enter the host at 6pm on August 1st, and we will not be able to open the door with a room card if we go out at 11pm on August 2nd. If the waiter opens the door, we must first check our identity. Certificate, I said that I had submitted the certificate when I entered the master, and now I have a room card and cannot enter the door, because the hotel service has a problem, why check my identity and then open the door. The lobby manager first quibbleed that there is no battery, I am the two of us It is unlikely that the room card will have no electricity at the same time, and it is also said that it is a security need during the Olympics. I said that we legally entered the host, and there was no violation of the law to check out on time. Besides, there is a national public security department that violates the law, so why restrict me Come and go freely within the valid check-in time. I hope Ctrip will give me a satisfactory answer. The hotel's attitude and service are very problematic! "
1	1. Long standby time, 7-8 hours is definitely not covered 2. Beautiful appearance, better workmanship 3. Better configuration 4. Easy to upgrade 
0	I stayed in this hotel again after 2 years. I gave a rating of 4 to 5 points, but today I can no longer see the service and environment when I applied for 3 stars 2 years ago. The waiter has no smile and the breakfast has no variety , The facilities are aging, disappointed. 
1	The price/performance ratio is quite high, especially the 1999 special offer is very cost-effective. The performance is enough for general use, anyway, it is Internet access and a small amount of text processing, which is quite sufficient 
0	The first hard drive and screen are broken and the quality is unstable. I wonder if it is an ASUS problem or a logistics problem? ! 
0	Like many buyers, I encountered the problem of scratches on the surface of the metal sign, but I knew that I could not return the goods. I went to the mall to see the prototype, and basically every one had scratches, so I don't know whether it is the RP problem or a common phenomenon. There is a heat dissipation problem in use, but it is basically acceptable. Although there is a Bluetooth icon, there is actually no hardware support. 
1	The positioning is a netbook, and the Linux system is definitely sufficient. Especially this release version of Moblin, is simply tailor-made for this kind of only used for surfing the Internet. The interface design, as well as the function keys are very convenient and intimate. 
1	I bought a copy of the UK version of TWILIGHT 109 before, it seems too expensive! I wanted to buy it at that time. Now I saw Dangdang only 280, and I bought it without hesitation. The one that just happened to be on vacation was called an anxious one who even went to sleep and took a walk for fear that he might miss the deliveryman’s phone number. Alas, 6 days later, finally I came to Shunde with the goods ordered by Excellence in a few days. I guess the deliveryman was lazy and unexpected. This twilight is much larger than the UK. The paper is also very good. The light yellow is also very nice to ask. , If the pain of waiting is removed... 
1	"The theme of love and beauty runs through throughout his poems, expresses the desire for freedom, ideals, love and beauty in the eulogy to nature, and the depiction of life experience contains the exploration of the true meaning of life. He has extreme aversion to materialism, exploitation, oppression, and violence. He lives in isolation and desires inner spiritual freedom. He believes that true freedom means the sublimation of human nature, and people dominate their own destiny. ""The Prophet"" expresses the theme of the unity of all things and the transcendence of life. He believes that human beings must transcend death to achieve the eternity of life. "
1	In short, this is a blood type book that can arouse people's sense of identity, is also very interesting, very individual, and very much like that. Perhaps everyone’s body is no longer just the characteristics of a certain blood type, but is changing in mutual fusion and agitation. Therefore, type A people may have certain characteristics of type B, and type B people have gradually learned some patterns of type A. After all, blood types are constantly evolving. Isn't AB type the new blood type that appeared later than O, A, and B? When new blood types evolve, we will definitely have updated blood type instructions. 
1	"First of all, many people say that the transportation is inconvenient. Those of you are really used to the subway. In fact, there are still many places in Hong Kong that are not within a 15-minute walk of the subway station. However, it is a 10-15 minute walk from the Sheung Wan MTR station. It is a bit of a breakdown if we go to Hong Kong every day to walk in various shopping malls, and go back to the hotel for 10 minutes. There are ding-ding cars and buses available, and there are still near 12 o’clock in the evening. It’s quite interesting to sit in a ding-ding car and drive to the end, but it takes a little too long to get to Central, Causeway Bay. , So it’s better to take a bus or a Ding Ding bus to Sheung Wan MRT station if you go out in the morning. There are many small restaurants nearby. I have had breakfast at a few of them. They have both Chinese and Western styles. The taste is good and the price is cheap. You can buy a newspaper from the neighborhood to read. There are also two Pokka and Watsons and convenience stores nearby, but they are very small. As for the hotel room, we didn’t have so much luck to be upgraded to a full sea view room, but the half sea view room is very satisfactory to us. There is a small refrigerator and the bathroom is already considered luxurious in a Hong Kong hotel. The sea view is invincible. Beautiful, I want to break the glass to take a picture. The bed is two single beds put together. There are not many channels on the TV, but it doesn't matter. In those few days there was a European Cup and I fell asleep after just one glance. The service is very polite, but all the service staff in the lobby do not speak good English in Mandarin. The porter will take the initiative to help you carry your luggage to the lobby. There was an episode where I went up and found that the card could not open the door, so I went down to ask. After asking, I changed my card and came up to open the door to see that the room was full of things. It turns out that the wrong room number was written, Khan. As you have said, there will be a Ming report on your hand every day, but not on the day you check out. It's really ""warm"" details. The room was cleaned very clean and very nice, and the valuables I left around were all neatly arranged. After all, GF claimed that he would live in this place when he came to Hong Kong. Although the traffic is inconvenient, other aspects can make up for it. "
1	Powerful configuration, beautiful appearance, fast delivery, order on the first day, and arrive the next day, cool! ! 
1	A year ago we bought Carmela’s first book for our child’s 6-year-old son. The child liked it very much. He watched it easily. This year, I heard that the second album was published, so I hurried to buy it for my son. He said that every story in it deeply touched him. He loved every character and every story in Carmela. That is the story that really belongs to the child. One of my sons would say whenever he encounters something boring: There must be something more fun than this. The different Carmela gives our children a new mindset, especially those in the Chinese-style education environment. We love Carmela! 
0	Pretending to be a little depressed for a day. Before installing, you need to quickly grid plate, and then view sata. 
0	If Hu Lancheng feels as comfortable as the article, then it’s great. Some people say that Hu Lancheng is ignorant and cruel. It is like a child who is ignorant and destroys something. He is still asking for credit and rewards, hoping to get everyone's approval. If others are best to clap and applaud, then he will have a clear conscience. Why can't text and people equate? I don't understand! 
0	The author has obvious narcissistic tendencies, and only wives who have a husband who is not working can live like her. Many methods are not practical, and there are suspects of plagiarism, which is boring, and you can save if you don't buy it. 
1	When I saw this set of books, I immediately had the urge to buy, because this seems to be the book in my childhood memory that brought me a lot of happiness and doubts, and it is still unforgettable. Legends and stories have taken root in my heart since I was a child, together with those exquisite pictures. Although the new edition of the book is a bit expensive, I did not hesitate to place an order. I was very happy when I got the book. The quality of the book is very good. When I turn the pages of the book, it is like turning over the memories of childhood. The stories are vividly on the paper and saved~~~~ for my children to see! 
1	This is a book on the theory and practice of psychological counseling and treatment for adolescents with psychological disorders. The outline introduces the characteristics and techniques of adolescent psychological counseling. What is particularly exciting is that this book deals with some novel contents such as the common problems of Internet addiction, eating disorders and parent-child relationships among young people. In addition, some chapters in this book can be called the essence: for example, the description and introduction of family therapy are both detailed and specific, but also concise. In short, this is a very readable reading for professionals. 
0	Throughout the whole book (two volumes), from the text, to the structure, the characters, and the plot, no place is desirable. Although you have experience in the industry, you cannot write a book with a similar experience. The text needs to be expressed and refined. Very disappointed book 
1	The workmanship is solid, the button design is very user-friendly, the heat dissipation is very good, and the genuine system makes people feel a little right. The perfect screen, much like a mirror screen. This one has a microphone, it seems that the parameters are not written, a bit of a surprise. The decompression system is fast, and it is also convenient to install memory. You can insert it after removing the two screws and removing the back cover. There are illustrations in the manual. Like the gift from JD.com: I like the original Thinkpad bag. I have such a user-friendly bag for the first time; Samsung memory stick 1G, easy to install, makes up for the small memory defects of the notebook; Thinkpad black mouse, good Cute 
1	The price-performance ratio is very high. My colleague bought it, and I thought it was pretty good, so I bought one for my wife. My wife likes this machine quite a bit. 
1	1. Good heat dissipation performance 2. Multimedia touch buttons are innovative and easy to operate 3. Touchpad is sensitive and easy to use. 4.512M video memory is very helpful for external large monitors/HD TVs. 5. Pre-installed Linux system, affordable 6 .JD is fast and trustworthy 
1	The entire hotel is relatively old, but the design of the hotel’s guest rooms is very modern and clean. Except for the relatively small area (the executive floor or the general floor seems to be the same size), everything else is satisfactory. 
0	VISTA is not accustomed to use, slow speed, troublesome partitioning, bringing a lot of junk software, and troublesome uninstallation 
1	AMD dual-core CPU, 250G hard drive, and camera, economical. USB distribution is also reasonable. You can install XP, which is good. 
1	I said it was a fruit plate, but when I got to the room, I didn't have it at all. I called and asked several times. At first, I said it would be delivered immediately. Later, I said that it was delivered the next day after get off work. And the fruits were all whole and not cut. But overall it is worth the money. 
1	There is a camera. It's not too heavy. Overall satisfaction, the driver is not installed, ghost xp Rainforest Wind 9.9 is all done with one click. The original system is Vista and now it is DOS. 
0	The keyboard is very stiff and has no feel. The standard 2G memory is composed of two 1G, which is very depressing. I didn’t ask clearly at the beginning~~~ (Many of the outside purchases are single 2G, it is not convenient to expand the memory in the future) 
1	If you go to live, it is best to live in a room facing the compound, because there are some central air-conditioning equipment at the back of the hotel, which will affect your rest at night. The breakfast is average, nothing good. There is a small road next to the hotel, where there are several small affordable restaurants, such as private dishes. In general, international hotels are still the first choice when traveling to Yixing. 
0	I stayed again on June 1st and stayed in room 1312. First, the price rose from 238 yuan to 278 yuan. This is the peak season of Urumqi hotels. It is said that Urumqi hotels will increase in July and August every year. Understandably, after all, you can make money in just a few months. In winter, it is -20 degrees below zero and there are very few people. But I found that the minibar in the room was removed, and only two bottles of mineral water were left. 
1	Jingdong delivery is really fast, and it will be delivered the next day after ordering. The computer configuration and price are good, and I felt good when I ordered. It runs very fast. 
1	"It is worth mentioning that the title ""Brother Isn't Boasting"" is particularly good. Although it describes the historical biography after the founding of the People’s Republic of China, it does not read as severe and heavy as imagined. Wen is like a man, and Ang's optimistic attitude to life allows him to write such a vivid and emotional good article. Born to death without war scenes, without the bleak management of the Cultural Revolution, what Ange wrote is just the faces of sentient beings in history, sad, optimistic, brave... a thick biography has given us many readers a lot of spirit power. A really good book! "
1	1. Book a standard room and upgrade to a suite for free as there is no room after arrival. Like one 2. The room is very quiet 3. It is located in the west of Zhengzhou. If the activity is mainly in the east, traffic problems need to be considered.

1	Small and powerful battery. 720P movies can be watched normally. If you don’t play large-scale 3D games. It is enough for daily use. Delivery is fast. 
1	The child has watched it again, and as long as he sees Thomas when he goes home, he still picks it up and reads a story. Sometimes I say I am Thomas, a useful little train; sometimes I say I am James, the most beautiful little train. I am happy to see this set of books every day. 
1	After watching the first promotion, I immediately bought the sequel. I only read dozens of pages and haven't finished it yet. I really like the professional language of the author as a white-collar worker; the subtle feelings and mental activities that people interact with. Although I am not a white-collar worker in a foreign company, I can fully feel the interpersonal communication and working atmosphere of that work circle. I read it as a new life experience. The author is not an authentic writer, and the story is not as dramatic as that, but her subtle feelings about her work circle and her strong expressive ability have indeed produced an experiential reading effect. Recommend it. 
1	The room is clean, the facilities are good, and the furniture is a bit old. The front desk of the business room is good, but the cleaners are very average, the staying time is relatively long, and there are no new slippers for several times. However, the price of his house in the 4 stars is relatively low. 
1	The service is very good, the surrounding is very lively, it is very convenient to take a taxi and eat. The room for 330/night is relatively small, but clean and tidy. Although it is a four-star, the overall feeling is still very good. There are a lot of fish in Huaqing Pool. They are very beautiful. You can buy fish food at the front desk to feed them. 
1	The executive big bed room I live in really likes the environment in the western suburbs, the black swans in the yard, the red-crowned cranes, and the small wild cats in the western suburbs, a comfortable place to rest in the bustling Shanghai, and I will live here in Shanghai in the future. 
1	My son was in the fourth grade and showed a keen interest in some historical events. I bought some books for him while the iron was hot. I bought this book and my family often chooses a person to read it to everyone, share it together, and even imagine and discuss the scene at the time. Children can often express their unique understanding... This is an era of a hundred schools of thought and heroes. , The influence of these historical allusions on a boy must be far-reaching and incalculable... My husband and I think so 
0	Just replace the CD-ROM drive with DVD for burning, even if you add some money. 1g of memory is a bit less. I didn’t catch up with plus 1 yuan to send memory, sorry 
0	The official VISTA discs and drivers are really depressing. It is better to reinstall them if you get them. The mouse sent is very rubbish. The screen resolution is 1680*1050. From everestultimate, the video memory is DDR2, not DDR3. 
1	After reading this book, I was very touched. I once again saw stories from the book that made people happy, moved, or sighed with emotion. Many times, adults always think that their urgent desires are also children's needs. We always impose our own opinions and our likes and dislikes on children. We forget that in the eyes of children, the world is different from adults. I think that reading this book is more about changing or forming an idea. To be close to the child, to understand the child, to be the child’s confidant, good friend, and to experience and observe the world with the same eyes and heart as the child. 
0	You have to install the system yourself when you buy it, trouble! AMD cooling is not good! The response is a bit slow! The price is similar to our mall here! No benefits! 
0	"I bought his ""Soldier"" before. It's not bad. When I saw a new book, I thought it was a sequel. I eagerly bought it. The content is the same as the original one. The writing has been changed. I feel that it is not as good as the original version. The author is not kind. "
0	After I bought it, the baby didn't like it, and I didn't like it either. I say that this book is like Southern Orange and Northern Trifoliate, because the children’s books teach common things in daily life, but this set of books, such as many cars, are available in foreign countries, not in China at all, and it’s not called it that way. Tell him this. Unfamiliar, what's the use of translated things? I can't see it in China; I can't understand it abroad. It's better to keep the original English and it's more practical without translation! 
0	I stayed at this hotel on October 3, and the overall feeling is not bad. I will definitely not stay in this hotel again next time I go to Chengdu. Advantages: 1. The room is large, with refrigerators, microwaves, etc., with more complete equipment, and you can cook like home. 2. There are a lot of food around the hotel, it is very convenient to eat. 3. The transportation is also very convenient. 4. The community is relatively quiet. Disadvantages: 1. The service is very poor, the attendants are very few, and the service response is very slow. 2. The sanitation of the room is very poor. No change, it's dirty. The towels in the bathroom are also not very clean and very old. 3. Few breakfast varieties 
1	The most advanced family education (mainly preschool education) reference book in history. First, there is a theoretical basis (I am also a psychologist, the author cites classics, which shows that his knowledge is extensive); second, there is practice (my own children are always the most persuasive) and there are specific guiding significance (not overemphasis It’s from the common problems in education)... Also, the chapters are short in length, even if the child is noisy, he can still use his short pause time to read a chapter or two. The only regret is that it's not enough to read the book alone, I hope there is a sequel. 
0	I stayed in the West Building on October 24. The room is very spacious, but the facilities are older. Its room has two doors. This is rare, so it is very quiet at night and the sound in the corridor will be much smaller. The same price at the time, if you go Look for it on the nearby pedestrian street and there will be surprises. Fortunately, there is still a TV signal. It was a coincidence that Chang'e was launched that day. 
1	The screen is very clear, the whole machine is well made, and the special shortcut keys are very user-friendly. The customer service attitude was good, and the driver made an 800 call. 
1	"I read this book introduced by a friend, and after reading it, I feel that I really don’t understand my body. The time we study is all about physical chemistry, etc. There is no such kind of practical book at all. Thank you teacher Wu! Teach me to understand my body and use her well! We believe that the human body must be more perfect than the personal computer designed by him. Keeping healthy should be as simple as using a personal computer. Just follow the operating instructions and don't interfere with it, and use it correctly. This ""Human User Manual"" hopes to help everyone learn how to use the body earlier. "
0	The edges around the screen are a bit loose. Continue to use, the machine is still a little hot. The buttons under the touchpad feel bad. Side A is prone to fingerprints and needs to be wiped frequently. The carrying weight is still relatively large, of course, it has nothing to do with the large-capacity battery. 
0	The hotel is a four-star hotel, but it is also two-star, and there are too few breakfast options. If it is a four-star, do it as a four-star. If the room price is low, don't give it a four-star, and consider changing to other hotels in the future. In addition, broadband has to charge 20 yuan. 
1	The price this time is a bit more expensive than before, but it is still the first choice for customers. The environment is very good and the service is good. The waiter at the door was dumbfounded, and the others were praised. The guests are quite satisfied~~ 
0	Hehe, although the skin looks good and delicate, I can still tell it is stolen. But the content inside is really good, my mother loves to read it, and I also learned to find acupuncture points. 
1	The configuration is good and the price/performance ratio is high. The weight is also very light, and it comes with Windows XP and Windows Vista driver CDs. 
1	The location of the hotel is good, and the quality of the rooms is also very good, but the parking space is a bit less, parking is a bit tight. But it is understandable because it is in the center of Nanjing. 
1	I stayed at this hotel from August 27-29, 2007. The service of the hotel's 2 bellboys was very good, and we were deeply impressed. The first bellboy, MR.KENNTH, has been very professional, enthusiastic, courteous and attentive since we arrived. The second bellboy, MR.KEN, because we are not very familiar with the small streets of HK, we cannot know exactly which subway exit is the nearest. He patiently provided us with services and saved us a lot of time when we were looking for a way. But the front desk service is not ideal. Because their service is very good, so I specially wrote them a letter of praise to show my gratitude! 
1	Mingyue used popular and humorous language to restore that period of history for us. That period of history that was once glorious, but ended up in silence and disappearance.. Dad is more serious than me. The fifty-year-old did not wear reading glasses, day and night. Reading...I am ashamed, because I spend a lot of time on the Internet and make some useless stuff. Although I am a book lover, it is difficult to take the time to calm down and treat the text. Dad said When he was young, he spent a lot of time reading books, and now he clearly remembers it. It is his wealth. We must read more and read good books when we are young. 
0	I felt very good when I stayed in 2006, and the service and hardware were good. So this time I took my parents and relatives to stay here, and highly recommended this hotel that once felt very good. But this time the feeling is completely different. It can be said that I am disappointed and faceless. 1. When I checked in on the same day, I checked in at around 11 o'clock as stated on the reservation form (4 rooms were booked in total). The lady at the front desk told me that there was only one clean room, two dirty rooms had not been cleaned, and the other No time. I was very upset at that time. I had already confirmed it before, and I had booked it through Ctrip. I also confirmed the order. I received a reconfirmation call from Ctrip just 5 minutes before I checked in. It told me that there is no room. Said that the room may not be able to exit until 12:00. Halo, what kind of hotel is this! After some disputes, four rooms were finally booked. What a hard work! 2. One of them had to change the room. The waiters on the upstairs and downstairs had inconsistent statements, and the price difference between the room was changed for a long time. Later, because they were in a hurry to go out to play, it was not in their dispute. The training of waiters really should be strengthened! 3. For breakfast the next morning, because there is only one breakfast in each room, the child needs to add breakfast, and encounters the same problem the day before. Different waiters have different explanations. Originally, I called and consulted three children before going downstairs to dine. Two 1.4 meters and one 1 meter discount would cost 50 yuan. However, when dining in the restaurant, the two 1.4 meters cost the full price and the 1 meter half price. It's very unhappy. Forget it after the dispute, pay at the original price, too lazy to engage with the hotel, tossing that I am not in a beautiful mood. 4. The most annoying thing is this. I was woken up by heat in a four-star hotel at around 5 in the morning. The premise is that my air conditioner was turned on at 22 degrees and I would be woken up by the heat. My LG was sweating all over my bare arms. The same happened in the room where relatives lived. Turning off the air conditioner to save energy is so irritating. I called the housekeeping center, and it turned out that the main station answered the phone, saying that the water temperature had gone up and the air conditioner was not turned off. Then I asked him to ask the manager on duty to explain the air conditioner, but after 10 minutes, I randomly found a waiter to come and try I. After I complained on the phone, I turned on the central air conditioner again. What hotel, is it worthy of his shining four stars? How much energy can be saved by turning off central air conditioning? I really don’t know how the hotel considers it. Is it important for guests to save a little energy cost? Later, I went downstairs and negotiated with the hotel manager for a long time, but there was no result and the problem was not solved. I was very upset. In the end, I had to pack my things and go through the check-out procedures. Who calls us a vulnerable group? At the checkout, the hotel manager came over and explained that the air conditioner was not turned off, but the water temperature was up, so the temperature was high, and then discounted the price of the two rooms without air conditioner that we complained about. At this time, I was not in the mood to be wordy with the hotel, so I quickly settled and left, so that my beautiful mood of traveling should not be affected again. May I ask if the hotel has a clear conscience and does not turn off the air conditioner, then why do you come to give my room a discount? Additional comments on August 11, 2008: 5. The shower head in the bathroom is not working well. I barely rushed down after a long time of tossing. I originally wanted to change rooms, but LG said that the child is asleep, so don’t toss it (the child is in relatives). Shower in the room). Hotel feedback August 15, 2008: Dear guests, hello! First of all, I sincerely apologize to you. We did not serve you well during your stay at our hotel. It is our work mistakes and our usual training. Your criticism is to help us improve, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you! We will definitely accept your comments and hope that we can provide you with better service next time you come. I wish you and your family good health and success in your work! 
1	For a more practical machine, when adding memory, there is no small cover on the back that can be opened. It should be under the palm rest, or call 8009908888 to ask. When you take it apart, you will know that the heat dissipation is quite good, and the material used in the machine is very good and very strong. 
0	It is very troublesome to install the driver. It is difficult for beginners who are just starting to use the computer. Anyway, I asked my colleagues to help. Poor heat dissipation, hot after using for a while, only one hour after battery renewal 
1	At that time, the discount was 1300, the configuration was high, and the price-performance ratio was too high compared to the snap-up price. However, it is now 4999. 
1	The shell is very characteristic, the stripes are nice and it is good to use, it is easy to install XP according to the online saying, and there is an original mouse 
0	After being introduced by a friend, I bought this book. The topic is quite good and very contagious. After praying with expectation, I realized that the content was scattered and empty, and the more I watched it, the more bored I became. I lent it to friends who are already parents, and they feel the same with me. Anyway, the only thing we have in common in the books is that we must look at and considerate children from the perspective of children. Respect and consideration are all necessary-this truth should be known even by unparents. We just want to be better. Many practical processing skills. It is a pity that this book did not give us very good help in this regard! 
0	The hard disk is not partitioned, and VISTA is too slow. It seems that the temperature on the left side of my notebook is higher than that on the right side, but it is acceptable. 
1	There were a lot of mosquitoes at night. I and my friends who lived in the other room were bitten by the mosquitoes. I couldn't find the mosquito repellent in the room. :( 
0	Too heavy, the system can only be installed with XP2, and my genuine XP3 can't be installed, so I am confused for a long time. 
1	The relatively new four-star hotel is pretty good in all aspects, it should be regarded as a very standard 4-star service, it is worth recommending. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of the hotel, and look forward to your visit again! 
1	The packaging is very good. It is obviously a new book. Very different from previous books. It seems that Dangdang's service is getting better and better for me. However, the price is still a bit expensive. Because the content inside is a little bit different from what I imagined. However, it still feels very good. It is a good choice for women who have just fallen in love or just left school. For those who already have a little love experience, this book is a bit simple. However, it does not affect reading. Because half of the world is men. Ha ha. 
1	A friend recommended to buy this set of books, because the 9-year-old child has a lot of questions about sex, and I don’t know how to answer it. After the book was bought, the child liked it, first read it through, and then focused on the first volume. The place asked me, and then I put the book aside, and sometimes I found that he would pick it up after school and take a look at it. I guess he might have some sexual questions at school and find the answers in the book after returning home. I think it is suitable for 8-15 Reading children, especially girls, have sex awareness earlier than boys, and can be written to children earlier. 9-year-old children can read independently, and they will ask their parents if they don't know individual words. 
1	The environment and facilities of the entire hotel are very good, but I asked the waiter to get a map, but I never got it. The price seems to be higher than before. However, the price/performance ratio is satisfactory. 
1	The hotel is very quiet and the location is not easy to find. I turned around at the intersection of Changning Road and Zunyi and didn't see it. After getting off the Zhongshan Park subway station, go west along Changning Road on the right, pass the Zhongshan Intersection (via elevated), and then go forward. The road on the left is Zunyi Road. Don’t turn, keep going (Changning Road, keep walking on the right side) ), an alley, 1600 Changning Road hangs at the entrance of the alley. The hotel is very close to the subway station and Longemont Shopping Center. It is very convenient for shopping, eating and transportation. Value for money! But the price difference with Jinjiang Inn is too small, 239 and 249. If Ctrip can give you a discount, it would be great! Additional comments April 1, 2008: To add, Jinjiang Inn’s membership price is lower than Ctrip, only 224. If you have a membership card, don’t order it on Ctrip. The membership card needs to be bought for 158 yuan. It is a good deal if you live frequently 
1	The price of the single room is excellent value for money. The breakfast is good. The service is good and very user-friendly. Hehe, the first time I encountered a hotel with petals in the toilet. However, the hotel's bathing center and beauty salons cannot be used during the decoration. It was not mentioned when booking. 
1	I used a 2000-100, the price is very good. 16:9 screen, according to personal preference, watching movies is okay, there are blanks on both sides of the page. Good display quality 
0	The big and scary picture is a bit scary for adults. I don't like it very much, and my son doesn't like it very much either. Too big children, such as those over three years old, feel too simple. They only say a single sentence with two pages, which does not have much educational significance. However, children under three feel scary. I regret choosing this book. It really feels like this. 
1	"It can be seen that the author is very careful, the drawing is delicate and exquisite, and the character is cute. I like this little fox very much~ When I watched the chapter of ""Mom"", my parents happened to be on a business trip. I was the only one at home, so I just watched and watched. I cried (I haven't cried for more than a year). Overall it was very good, but because I got a brand new book, when I first opened it, the smell of ink was very pungent and uncomfortable. And it only took me 10 minutes to read the entire book. After all, it’s just a comic book. Friends who want to pursue rich text content may be disappointed... I suggest those who have more ""free money"" to buy it~~ "
1	It's so good to read. It's really a good book, a good book that people can't put it down. This is the first animal novel I put on my collection bookshelf! I hope I can publish a good book top ~ top Grandpa Mu Ling! 
0	I was ranked first in the rankings, so I bought it and I was very disappointed. I bought no less than 30 books on Dangdang. This book is the worst, so I can’t help but say it. It's not easy to use and not practical. To sum it up, drinking a cup of honey in the morning and evening can beautify your face. Not recommend everyone to buy 
1	Although there are cases of lesson plans, I don't feel that it is suitable for my education mode! Our experimental conditions are not so high, whether students or teachers don’t pay enough attention to biology. I have watched enough videos of classes in good classrooms. The students in their schools in Beijing attach great importance to the study of biology and prepare sufficient experimental data and discussions, which can play a very good teaching effect. However, this book is helpful to teachers who value junior high school biology teaching! 
0	The built-in system is too stupid, you have to turn off SATA in the bios settings, and then install other systems. 
1	This children's book is my favorite at the moment. I can't put it down and read it many times. Different times and different environments will have different feelings. The first feeling is: this is not only a children's book, but also suitable for lovers and relatives. Between, between sisters, between friends~~~~ Because of this love, the expression is so innocent and straightforward, with no impurities at all. When looking at the two and a half-year-old son, he always points to The big rabbit called: Dad! Dad! I observed carefully and found that the big rabbit is really a male expression and movement, hehe~~~ a very, very good book! 
0	I stayed in a deluxe suite. The discounted price was 2990, but after I checked in, I found that the price/performance ratio was extremely low. The suite is in the front building, and the highest is the 9th floor. The smallest five-star suite I have ever stayed in, I will never choose this hotel again. 
0	It would be nice to send a mouse. After another 2 hours, the temperature on the right side of the touchpad was a bit high, and it was not measured because there was no instrument. 
0	The writing is really bad. No literary talent. It has nothing to do with foreign companies. I really don't know why there are so many comments on this book. Fudge people. Ha ha. 
1	I watched the TV series and thought it was pretty good, so I bought the book again, and I felt that the book was better. After all, some psychological descriptions are not comparable to TV dramas. Maybe the protagonist of this book is about the same age as me, so sometimes it feels too close to life in it, so the mood of the protagonist keeps going up and down. For the marriage of our new generation who emphasizes independence, we face more choices and difficulties than our parents. The protagonist’s experience is also a revelation for our real little couples, hoping to find out their similar shortcomings and shortcomings. 
1	"Jia Zhigang is talented, so he wrote Chunqiu, but people are as messy as Chunqiu, wrong, wrong! It should be said that people's hearts are chaotic like Spring and Autumn. Therefore, as soon as ""Spring and Autumn"" came out, there were praises and bombs. In fact, Jia Zhigang was right. If you don't look at Chunqiu, you don't even know the ancestor's name! Although the sentences in the book are slightly inelegant and vulgar, they are easy to understand. If the people who write the book are written in classical Chinese or are not vulgar, deliberately turning corners, no need to write in the Spring and Autumn Period, no need to read, and the ancestors are no need to care! So Chunqiu depends on whether he writes well or not. "
1	"I'm so dizzy that my comments can't be edited? ? ? Can’t I correct a few typos? ? ? ""Yuji, is the pain of venting depression"" should be ""Yuji, is the pleasure of venting depression"", the meaning has changed greatly! ! ! "
1	Location: Quiet and convenient transportation. There is a small supermarket in front of the door with everything available. Laoya fans snacks, and the hotel restaurant food is also good. It is 5 minutes walk away from Jiuguang, 20 minutes away from Nanjing West Road shopping mall Henglong Plaza, Westgate, CITIC Pacific, parallel to Huaihai Road, shopping on the street is super! Room: I live in a deluxe double room, the environment is good, clean and sanitary, 24 hours hot water, heating and cooling air-conditioning, and magazines for reading. The only catch is that the TV is a bit small. The service attitude is also good and can promptly respond to customer requirements. Will live next time I go. 
1	It's really good! The location is better, the sea view room is facing the trestle bridge and Xiaoqingdao, you can enjoy the pleasant sea view without leaving the door or crowding in the tourist crowd; the breakfast is rich and the environment is good, and the price is relatively high; the coffee bar on the first floor The simple meals are not high in price, taste better, and have plenty of portions (especially sandwiches and hot dogs). It is a good choice for residents and non-resident tourists to solve a simple meal or as a snack; the snacks in the hotel corridor are more popular and varieties There are many, high-quality, and timely additions, which are loved by children; that is, the bed is slightly smaller (referring to if you bring a child to sleep). In short, the overall feeling is good, it is recommended to stay. 
0	The facade of this hotel is very small, unlike a three-star hotel at all. The occupancy rate does not seem to be high, anyway, when I lived, there were few people. The room size is relatively standard, but the lighting is not very good. The network is extremely poor and often fails to connect. Service is average 
0	The room is great, poor service, poor attitude, poor room facilities~~I will never go again. Just one word 
0	The house price is still a bit expensive, if the house price is 200, it will be fine. 
1	HP's brand is still good, the workmanship is good, I originally had an HP M2000, but the low-end machine has never broken. Compared to the current workmanship, it is much better. Just enough configuration. 
0	I chose this one after seeing everyone's good reviews. In any case, the room cannot be said to be Samsung's standard. I personally feel that it is not as warm as home. 
0	From December 4th to 7th, a group of 7 of us stayed in Huangjia, and it felt bad for me and my colleagues. One room had no heating, and the attitude of changing rooms was not good. After the room was changed, there was still no heating; the bathroom facilities in the second room were poor. , The basin faucet has very little water, the bath and shower area, the water is not smooth, the facilities are outdated, and the bathroom bathing environment is very cold; three breakfasts are acceptable. I hope that Huangjia should be renovated. The current room facilities and services do not meet the 4-star standards and requirements. 
0	In August, I will stay in this hotel, perhaps in the capital, Beijing, for 260 yuan a night. I only want to stay once. Everything is so old, as if 260 yuan is not money. 
1	I stayed at this hotel for the first time, and the overall feeling was good. The waiters were greeted with smiles, and the service was attentive. The rooms were clean and warm. The deluxe room was also equipped with an LCD computer for free internet access, and the internet speed was very fast. Next time I go to Shenzhen, I will stay at this hotel. Hotel feedback August 5, 2008: Dear guests, hello! First of all, thank you very much for your praise of our shop. At the same time, I am very happy to inform you that the network fiber of our shop has been upgraded from the original 2M to 5M, which greatly improves the network speed, making it more convenient and faster for business office or Internet surfing. Continuously improve service levels and provide guests with better service is our aim! We sincerely welcome you to visit again! 
0	When I took it back and installed the system, I discovered that there was a dead pixel on the screen. When I checked the machine, I was afraid that the DOS system could not verify it. Then I realized that it seems that it is best to buy a computer with an installation disk, otherwise it is really annoying~~~ ~ 
1	Although the hotel is a bit old and the rooms are not big, it is clean and the location is good. It is very convenient to go anywhere on the edge of Zhongshan Square in the city center. The breakfast is rich and satisfying. The room has a lot of bath water, like a hydromassage, very comfortable. The most satisfying thing in the room is the small bottled water, which is very convenient. Unlike many hotels, I have to boil it and drink it myself. What impressed me the most was a young man with a beard outside the gate. He was very enthusiastic to the guests and asked him anything to get meticulous and satisfactory answers. Two shortcomings: 1. I booked a room for two nights, but when I came back at noon the next day, the key couldn't open the door. After a lot of work, I called and asked and went downstairs to the front desk to complete the formalities before entering the room. This kind of work error is not right. 2. The toilet in the bathroom is very weird. The front end is very shallow. I was sitting down to defecate, and the urinating place hit the bottom of the front end of the toilet. I was scared to flush the lower part! Later, I dared to squat. 
0	There are no obvious shortcomings. Even the pre-installed VISTA system still brings a little trouble, and the compatibility with the software is not ideal. 
1	I originally wanted to book Wei Lan Xuan or Bayview International Hotel, but there were no rooms, so I chose Rosedale. Fortunately, it did not disappoint me. When I booked it, there were only deluxe rooms. The price of HKD791/day is relatively cheap in Hong Kong. I stayed with JF for two days. The hotel is not so difficult to find. Although we asked a few Hong Kong people in Causeway Bay, they didn’t know the Rosedale Hotel. Fortunately, when I came out from Exit F of Causeway Bay MTR Station, I could see the logo on the high building of the hotel, so I looked for the hotel Did not spend a lot of effort. However, there are many flyovers around the hotel, and JF is exhausted by dragging his suitcase and climbing the steps. The attitude of the hotel is okay, Hong Kong people are very polite, and the front desk is not slow. The front desk said that we were at an exhibition in Hong Kong these few days, so the deluxe rooms were full, and we were upgraded to an executive room for free-it was a bargain! The room is on the 30th floor with a nice view, with sea views and mountains. The residential buildings next to it are all very tall. If our room were not upgraded to an executive room above the 28th floor, such a good view would be blocked by the residential building. The room is really small. I have a double bed. After putting a big bed in the room, I can’t put other things. But the equipment is more complete, the TV is LCD. The 80 yuan buffet is still more expensive, and you can't get a refund if you order it. Even if you don't eat it, you will be charged. If you go out for morning tea, the total of the two is only 80 or 90 yuan. The location of the hotel is ok, quiet in the middle of noisy, less than ten minutes walk to the busiest commercial area where SOGO and Times Square are located in Causeway Bay. It is very convenient to take the bus or the subway. I want to remind everyone that a deposit must be paid when staying in a hotel, and UnionPay credit cards cannot be used to pay the deposit (but UnionPay can be used at the checkout), only VISA or MasterCard. We paid the deposit in Hong Kong dollars, and paid a deposit of 3,000 yuan for two days. Generally speaking, it is ok, but compared with the hotels in the mainland, it should not be enough for the four-star standard. If the price can be lower, I will consider choosing this hotel next time. 
1	The front desk service is poor and not considerate of customers. A friend came to clean the room, but it was not cleaned after calling for two hours. The sewer in the room was stinking, and the bathroom leaked and blocked the water. 
1	1. The appearance is small and beautiful. The machine should be pearly white, and it will reflect slightly pearly when there is light. 2. The machine configuration is enough for girls. I tested a 720p, 4g movie file and played smoothly without delay. 3. The signal of the wireless network card is very stable and satisfactory 
1	It's much better than I thought, and it's much better than netbooks at the same price. It looks business-like and has good performance. More than 3000 is worth it. The keyboard is special, like Apple's. 
1	This hotel has a good location, in Wuxi compared to the downtown area ~ convenient for travel 
1	cheap price. Relatively light and power saving. Comes with XP, vista driver CD, which is better than thinkpad, you don’t need to find it on the website, it’s very convenient 
1	"""Capital"", like Adam Smith's ""The Wealth of Nations"" and Keynes's ""General Theory"", is just a set of economic theory books. But after China took root, the Chinese people used it as a theory of social system to study, and many derivative versions were produced. The impact of the financial tsunami has caused us to reflect on the western tradition-economic theory, and when trying to find the truth behind the phenomenon through the theory of capital, we must not forget that the theory of capital is just a set of economic theory books. To read the original version of this literal translation... "
1	With original package, original mouse, 1G Samsung gold bullion DDR3 memory, 250G mobile hard drive, 6799 yuan to start. 
1	Due to time constraints, I can only write it down hastily. I have always liked Teacher Yu Minhong's speech, and I have been preparing for the exam recently, which is very hard, so I bought this book specially and took it out when I wanted to give up. It will immediately gain a lot of motivation to keep me going. The most in the book is about going abroad. Because of the limited conditions, I will not consider it for the time being. Therefore, I also bought a copy for my friend. She is very hesitant to go abroad, hoping to help her. Recommend this book to everyone. Any success in learning books is just an incentive, the key is to rely on yourself. 
1	"For this carp, I bought it according to the theme of each issue. The first time I bought ""Carp&#183; Solitude"", it was natural that Zhang Yueran wrote it. After I bought it, I found out that it was her editor in chief. I was a little disappointed. I just read a few articles and felt that it was like this. It didn't make much sense, but I have always liked the theme of her book, so this time I bought ""Carp&#183; Lies"". After reading it, I really liked the theme of the book, and the content in it was quite good. Although I didn't read each article, it made me feel different. very nice! "
1	I have been following Benben for more than a month, and I have taken a fancy to this one! GT130M! ! ! The CPU is enough. It looks pretty 
1	Fine workmanship, clean and elegant interface, performance no less than that of some big brands, thoughtful packaging, and I like it very much at first glance. I used it for two days without any strangeness. 
1	My family likes it very much. I bought this book right. Haha, welcome to communicate with me again, toryhellen@sina.com. 
1	The rooms are large and convenient. Breakfast is ok. Next time I go to Shenyang, I will stay there. Additional comments on December 25, 2007: A bit more expensive, if it were not for the company to pay the bill would not live there. 
0	The four-star standard is totally not up to the four-star standard. The lady at the front desk has a stinking face, and the waitress in the south building still hides enthusiasm. The quilt has a strange smell, the bathroom floor is untidy, the TV does not have an international station, and I received a call from the massage lady in the middle of the night The only thing I think is okay is that the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are okay. Meals are not expensive. 
0	It's very sad. I live in a double standard room. National Day is 230. I lived in Hangzhou for a trip to Jinhua. It has been very frustrated. This man has a bad taste. There is still a strange smell. The only advantage of screaming is that the tickets for nearby attractions (such as: West Zhejiang Grand Canyon, Tiantan, Daming Mountain, etc.) , I heard the driver who brought us to Tiantan that day introduced a hotel in Grand Canyon Town. 
0	Serious light leakage! Don't give up yet! depressed! Said it is not a quality problem! It's the first time to buy for a classmate, hey! I won't buy it next time I'm killed 
1	I stayed at Rujia, which made me who is drifting doing technical services really feel at home, I really like it! 
0	It is easy to stick fingerprints~~The memory is relatively small~If the memory is 2G, it is estimated that more friends will like it (2G memory is not much different from 1G) 
1	Cost-effective, the recorder is equipped with LightScribe disc surface lithography technology, that is, it can perform light engraving recording 
1	The hotel is well-equipped and clean, but it is still some distance away from the subway station. You have to go through several small shopping malls. There are no signposts. You still have to ask people. But at this price, the price/performance ratio is pretty good. And paying in Hong Kong dollars is very cost-effective to convert into RMB. 
1	It may be that I lived for a long time, one month, so the service is still very good. I live on the 15th floor and it is quite quiet at night. Although it is a room facing the street, the breakfast has not changed much. 
0	After reading it, I don’t know what the author wants to say, but I want to know the specific method and the result is nothing, and it cannot solve the actual problem. 
1	The rooms are very nice, and the breakfast is good, quite satisfactory. The room lacks a sewing kit, and the staff of the housekeeping department reacted relatively quickly, and then went to Shenyang to live in Gordon. 
0	Too bad luck, there is a dot in the center of the screen. There are only two USB ports, and the card reader does not have a protective cover, which is close to dust. Toshiba's manual is messy and difficult to understand 
0	The price is a bit high, the battery power consumption is too fast, the body is easy to leave fingerprints, and the others have not been found! There is no favor at all, and no gifts at all! hateful! 
1	Praising a woman has always been based on a good wife and a good mother. It seems that a woman's life should only be dedicated to herself. Be a girl for a lifetime, teach you to find the happiness of women, teach women to choose their own lifestyles with new perspectives. The process of language and thought change in this book, the process of seeking faith, has nothing to attract me. What attracts me is the result. Or the final point of view. This is an era of personalization, and there is never only one way of life. Choose what you like best! Of course, people who are not financially independent lack independent personality. Remember to remember. . . 
0	A bad hotel. I charged an extra 90 yuan at the checkout. I only found out after I came back to look at the bill. First, I told Ctrip to help check it. I said it was the consumption of my friend’s room. I have never heard that I can charge someone else’s room without my signature. Hung up. I called the reception desk and said that it was my breakfast consumption, but in fact my breakfast was paid in cash, and I couldn’t find an excuse. I said that there was an order signed by me at the coffee shop on the first floor. , Please fax to the front desk for verification, and said to confirm, in fact, I have no other consumption at all. There is also a superior room with two beds, if you want a large bed, it is in the promotion. The surrounding environment is not to mention, even There are no supermarkets. 
0	Why doesn’t it show up on the page when it’s out of stock? What else can people buy? Isn't this a lie! At the very least, respect for customers should show that they are temporarily out of stock. Don't make people waste their efforts. 
1	After reading this book, I realized that the most respectable era in Chinese history is Spring and Autumn. The era of contending a hundred schools of thought. The king has a kingly way, from top to bottom, all are polite and orderly. The stories in the book are very interesting, the style of writing is casual, they seem to be talking about history, but they also have a taste of ridiculing history. Especially suitable for middle school students who are still studying history. May wish to listen to how people other than the teacher talk about history. Of course, the historical story is still a bit shallow. And it's the first one, half of it is seen, it's a bit of a half pole. Just wait for the next one. 
1	Very easy to use, good speed, especially easy to use, great workmanship, classic good things, buy early and enjoy 
0	When I checked in, I said it was a four-star hotel, and I was disappointed when I entered. . . . 
0	Looking at this book with longing, and seeing the end, it was not as shocking as expected, so tearful. The author’s writing style is very poor, very basic, and the narration makes people unable to resonate with emotions. I suggest that he learn more from those famous works and write about the Cultural Revolution. Please see how Yu Hua wrote about love. Please see how Aunt Qiongyao describes In addition, I feel that the purest love in this history is too much of a name. Amy, do you think that simply describing the male and female protagonists without having a relationship is pure? ? ? ? It seems that your understanding of love is still too shallow 
1	"""Little Doudou by the Window"" describes a child's innocent childhood and simple inner world. Maybe every child has similar thoughts and mentality in childhood, but they were stifled by the so-called mature and correct thoughts early. Now I am a mother-to-be, Xiao Doudou showed me how to properly train children. I am very grateful for the enlightenment given to me by ""Little Doudou by the Window"". I am very grateful for Doudou's childlike fun and teacher Xiaolin's educational model. . "
0	1. A bit heavy, 2. The speed is obviously slower than a 14-inch notebook. When opening a lot of web pages, it is a bit stuck. 
1	The environment of the hotel is very good, but the room decoration is average, relatively old. The service is also good, there is a 24-hour room service. Although the facilities are old, I will choose here next time, because the hotel environment attracts me because it happens to be the peach blossom season, which is very big The Taoyuan, the peach blossoms are splendid! Worth it! 
1	Marriott is an internationally renowned hotel, and the front desk service is finally qualified and the attitude is good. However, it may be due to Chongqing. The quality of this room is very average, old, small and ordinary facilities. According to this price, you can find rooms in Chongqing's CBD Jiefangbei that are of much higher quality, but the price is much cheaper. The most worth mentioning is the western restaurant next to the hotel lobby. The lunch buffet may be due to lack of business, food freshness and poor service attitude of the waiters plus Chongqing's top five-star charges, and you will immediately decide not to consider going in. I have stayed in several five-star hotels in Chongqing Jiefangbei. It is recommended that if you re-brand guests, if you choose InterContinental, you will find that there is a big difference and good value for money. 
0	Like the title.. The author can be described as I don’t know what to say. I wasted my time. She is at best a white-collar writer. A white-collar writer with no literary foundation. I regret reading such books. I want to experience in my own life. It’s okay to record your own footprints. But the problem is that you still publish a book.....I suggest that if you really want to publish a book, you should do it at the same level as Fu Yao. Compared with <Win or Lose>. Not at all One level.. Again, this book is too disgusting. This person is too disgusting. If you don’t believe it, buy it 
0	Although the CPU generates a small amount of heat, the hard disk of the machine generates a lot of heat, which causes the CPU fan to continuously rotate at a high speed. It is too noisy when used at night, and it is much louder than the sound of my 15-inch HP (same workload, no Talking about speed), this is a pity! 
0	From 2004 to 2006, I often took my colleagues and family to live in Building 1 of the main building. When I checked-in this time, I was told that I lived in Building 2. There is no elevator in Building 2. It is troublesome to bring a 3-year-old child. In addition, the window is not like Building 1 with a view and the rooms are outdated, but the price is the same as Building 1. Similarly, there is a feeling of being fooled. If you can't confirm in advance in the future, I don't plan to stay in this hotel. 
1	The wife of MSI’s book is very satisfied with it. It looks eye-catching and the workmanship is as good as the past. The 6-cell battery can last for 5 hours. The built-in XP system is installed. This price is compared to Zhongguancun and profiteers. The struggle still has to rest assured. Jingdong's distribution is very fast this time, and the next day you can go to the headquarters to pick it up. 
0	It's better to go there and find a tour guide to book. It is cheaper than Ctrip. The tour guide said that they can get a price of 300 yuan on November. The price Ctrip gave me is too high 
1	I went after reading comments from netizens, it was really good. The environment is good, close to the sea, the hotel swimming pool is also good, and the service is better, much like the service in Hainan, Thailand and other places, all are smiling services, the accommodation does not require a deposit, and the CHECK IN/OUT is very fast; it is the welcoming guest The house on the first floor does not have a lobby; in addition, there seems to be a problem with the design of the shower room. . . 
0	The story feels abrupt, and the protagonist suddenly died? I think there should be some other plots, and the heroine is too...what is the heroine? (Except for plump??? The author always describes this...) 
0	Installing the system is too much trouble for novices. After two days, the joy of owning a new laptop is gone! Hope that Jingdong can provide this service! 
1	The hotel feels good, the details are considered more thoughtful, the price is slightly more expensive, the standard room is a bit small for two people. 
0	I booked a business double room. The room for me was room 8418. The bed was quite big, but the room was too small. Basically, I went to bed when I entered the room. I couldn’t even let go of the chair. Going to the big balcony with sea view, I don't know how it was designed. It is estimated that this room should be a single room. Homeinn’s TV shows have mosaics, so I called the front desk. They told the engineer to come and see. After a few minutes, an aunt with a walkie-talkie came and told us that it was the signal. The programs in all rooms are like this. Talent is good, we thought it would be fine, but a friend from another room who would travel with us said that their TV signal has always been good, and was so mad that Rujia actually lied to customers like this, called the front desk, and said yes. The signal in some rooms is like this. The signal was good after 8 o'clock in the evening, but there were still mosaics the next day, and it was not good at night. After staying for three nights, the slippers were not changed and they were broken. The mosquito-repellent incense was not changed on the third day. The water dispenser in the room has a strong smell of 84 disinfectant water, and I can't drink it at all. I bought bottled water at Carrefour. There is only one bedside lamp, and the contact is not good, so it won't light up without lighting. It is recommended that customers staying in this house in the future do not live in this room with a balcony. The room without a balcony is still very large. Additional comment June 23, 2008: Forgot to mention, the address location is not bad, there are a lot of buses, if you go out to play, first go to see the bus route, but the car is very slow, we took a seat A car that started from Old Man Shi returned to Rujia, and it turned out that the top speed of the car was only 40 miles per hour, which is not an exaggeration. It’s also very close to Badaguan on foot, and you can also walk to Eryu, but its gate is not facing Hong Kong West Road. Sometimes a taxi will take a few circles to get there. (Taxi drivers in Qingdao have a bad conscience. If you are scolded by the people all over the country, you will have to pit the money 
0	I bought this book together with Wolf Tuteng, but only the book Wolf Tuteng got in my hands. I also asked me to comment. ;;Too much...send the book quickly, I will not pay for the express Yes. I'm so angry. I said it last time, but I didn't help me. Please call to explain clearly. Otherwise, I won't come again. 
1	Not worth the price, breakfast is too bad, maybe I went late, around nine o'clock, there was nothing to eat 
1	The environment is not bad, and the service is okay. The environment is similar to the Shangri-La next door, but it is much cheaper. I wanted to swim, but I was told that the swimming pool was not open due to renovation, which made me depressed. The ladies at the front desk are stingy with their smiles. Once arrived by Mazda, there was no service at the door; once arrived by imported Audi, someone helped with luggage and got off the car. No one helped send luggage to the room. I guess we are Chinese, so there is no tip. Do you want me to learn a few sentences of Japanese? But I don't want to learn. When I was eating in the western restaurant on the second floor and drinking tea in the lobby bar on the first floor, I saw a lot of girls with different dresses and different accents. I hope I guessed wrong... If I guessed right, eat with them in the same place Not very comfortable. 
0	I didn't receive this book. I obviously bought it with another one and the service was not good. At least let me know this situation! 
0	Why are the prices of Dangdang items reduced after I bought them? I just bought the USB flash drive and I want to go up and write a review, and I saw the price reduction. Now I see the price of the purchased items are falling again. Fainted! Dangdang, the price is also It's too unstable! 
1	"I read this book after reading the book and essence, and I think it is still very rewarding. Although it emphasizes the word ""full"", it is very logical and focused. It can be seen that the author has a wealth of practical experience and knows exactly what problems will be encountered during operation. Some basic people feel that they can still find a bright spot in a quick browsing. This book can be used as a separate learning material to enable learners to quickly master many of EXCEL's tricks, and it can also be used as a reference book for reference. The quality of the book is indeed average, and there are typos, but it does not affect the mood of learning. "
0	The environment is very bad. Next to the old train station, it is very old and noisy. Like most netizens said, Ctrip reservations are cheaper, but if the room is a poor hotel, I was given room 902 in the corner. The space is the smallest in the same floor. But the whole city of Shangrao is very dilapidated, which is reasonable. 
0	The room is ok, but there is no internet. It is very inconvenient to go online to the lobby. The quality of the front desk staff is very poor, and they asked to change the room to talk to them twice, each 30 minutes, and finally the foreman came to solve it. 
1	I personally like the stories of that era. Although the background was gloomy and the experience of most people at that time was tortuous, I still like it, and I like the passive feeling. I read this book two years ago, but the content is still fresh in my memory. I like Yu Hua's writing style. In his book, he satirizes people and things of that era very implicitly. This book is like a movie film. Looking at the text, I can imagine the plot back then. I think of Song Fanping’s stalwartness, Song Gang’s cowardice, and Li's bald head’s rebelliousness. In short, the plot in it seems like a movie version is acting in my mind. , I feel very enjoyable. 
0	Never stay next time! The facilities are simple and the soundproofing is poor. I gave it to the room next to the public toilet. I was tortured by the huge pipe noise in the middle of the night. I asked them to interfere in the morning. Everyone pretended to be stupid. behavior! Additional comments January 2, 2008: Forgot to mention, I lived in a standard room of 336 hotel 
1	The location is good, the room environment is OK, the laundry speed is fast, it is praiseworthy, the only downside is that many floors are messy during the renovation. 
0	The speaker of the machine does make a sound when it is turned on, and Lenovo’s gift package is not available. The price is a bit expensive, not much different from the official website quotation. There are too many appendages on the appearance of the machine, and it is garish. It is recommended to remove all the pastes. The system is not suitable for use at all 
0	"The hotel facilities are not bad, but because the predecessor was remodeled from an unfinished building, the overall space is wide, and many rooms have no windows. You need to pay special attention when booking. The so-called executive room is absolutely impossible to live in. The toilet and shower room are separated by glass in the same house, and the wash basin is beside the bed. The layout is unbelievable and it is actually an executive room. The quality of the waiter is extremely poor. I booked through Ctrip and stated that two men were staying in, but only reserved a single bed house, and insisted that ""Ctrip did not specify two beds."" "
1	There are many problems. I just bought the CD-ROM drive and it doesn't come out, so I have to use a needle to get it out! In desperation, I went to the repair station the next day to disassemble the machine for repair, but something still didn't work, and later found that the standby could not be awakened! I called the customer service and asked me to flash the motherboard! If you take his repair machine, you can't get it back! Obviously there is a problem with the motherboard 
1	Pros: The location of the hotel is very good, the service is very good, and the breakfast is good. Disadvantages: The room can't access the Internet. The hotel engineer said that the swtich was broken. It was not repaired from the afternoon to 11 pm, disappointed. . . The next morning, I had to collect internet fees from me. Oh my god, I didn’t use the internet for a minute... Generally speaking, a hotel at this price in Hong Kong should be considered very good. 
1	Produced by ASUS, with excellent workmanship, good feel and stylish appearance. I started using the ASUS EPC900 a year ago. In contrast, the keyboard of the EPC 1000HE feels better than that of the 900, and the size is larger, and men can use it comfortably. In addition, the 1000HE touchpad is very comfortable to use. ASUS has never stopped pursuing humanity. Each generation of products is surprising. Finally, the selling point of this EPC is the long battery life. Although there is no actual 9.5 hours, it is no problem to spend 7 hours. It can fully cope with mobile office, which is much higher than the 1.5 hours of EPC900. 
0	"I can't believe my eyes, this is called a four-star! ? I shook the lens from a curly hair on the floor of the bathroom to the mottled TV (note that it is ""shaking"", not ""following""!), trying to find a reason, but failed! Later, after spending a long time opening the window, I saw the seemingly prosperous corner of Central Street. I suddenly realized that the selling point here is not hardware and software, but accessories! The allusion of ""borrowing chickens to lay eggs"" keeps coming out of my head...I think it is better to live in Huaqi or Fushun Tiantian at such a price. Due to depression, I stayed for one night and left. I don't know how the breakfast is. I am not sure about other aspects. The overall feeling is dark and old. Recommend friends who are trying to remember the hardships and strengthen the education of patriotism to live! "
0	This set of books was introduced by others. I went home and shared the content of the story with my 3-year-old daughter. The more my daughter listened, the more I loved it. Now we will use the dialogue in the story to play games at home, which is really good. 
1	The ASUS notebook I bought on JD.com found a serious problem the next day and couldn't use it. Later, after testing at ASUS Repair Station, it was found that the motherboard was broken, but due to the long delay in the testing process, it exceeded 15 days for replacement. Now, I request a new machine or a return. You can't sell broken and defective products to customers, right? ! Hope to give me a clear answer, thank you. Mobile: 13341772746 
0	Without CD-ROM, it’s a bit difficult to change LINUX to XP, you need to make a USB flash drive. The screen is too small, and the male compatriots may not be used to it. 
0	I have to move and touch my notebooks frequently. What kind of piano paint is used? The standard 800 bar is replaced with 2×2G-800. At first glance, the CPU FSB is 667. The memory dropped to 667, depressed. Don't want to overclock. Very fever. Without the control software installed, the air outlet on the left is hot. 
0	Too bad. I have never seen such a 4 star. There is no doorman to help with luggage. There is no refrigerator in the room. There is no bar. There is no safe. The water in the bathroom is yellow. The temperature was 6 degrees last night. I really don't know how the 4 stars are obtained, I will never go again~! ! 
1	"I first came into contact with Jidi paintings on ""Xin Lei"", and later bought her first collection of paintings ""My Way 1"" with great joy. I like the warm style of painting and the text with the painting, which is very delicate. , Philosophical, makes people feel warm. Later, she bought every issue of her, and wrapped it in four-leaf clover paper. This time she bought this set for a friend. My friend saw that I had a set of ""My Way"" and wanted it, so I asked me to buy it for her. At first I was worried about whether there will be any bonus items in it. It seems that there are some. My friends are very happy and like it. "
1	XP is installed and it feels good. All drivers are officially provided, and the drivers for various shortcut keys are also fixed. It's very fast and very good. 
0	There is no pre-installed mainstream VISTA system or XP, which is more troublesome to use. For novices, reinstalling the system is a painful thing. There is also no mainstream notebook camera. The workmanship can only be said to be average. 
1	However, the book is abridged online, such as deleting the episodes in the online version of Qinghan and kissing A Li. I don’t know what the editor thinks, is this necessary? 
0	After receiving it, I found that there was a crack on the disc. I have contacted dangdang to return the goods. I suggest dangdang to change the express. 
1	Lightweight and cost-effective! It is worth it! My company only bought the exact same machine at the end of April, which cost more than 5,000 
0	After 8 o'clock in the morning, there is nothing to eat, and there is a limit of ten yuan. The waiter in the restaurant has a bad attitude. I stayed in a standard room of 158 yuan and the room was very dark. It is very old and will never stay here next time. I went to see it was much better than this. 
0	I liked this book... after I sent it... I found that the crease on the cover was particularly serious. . . It’s also inside... I’m very disappointed... don’t do this next time. 
1	The fan is designed in the upper left corner of the notebook, which is very reasonable. Two usb ports on the left and right, which is very convenient for connecting mobile hard drives with power supply 
1	"1. Take a taxi to the hotel and leave, and send the card for registering the taxi number. If there are missing items, it is easy to find; 2. The front desk service is fast; 3. I had two dinners in the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor. The taste is very good and the service First-class, take the initiative to guide the seat to facilitate watching TV, convenient to watch the Olympics, breakfast has a unique snack area in Xiamen, regardless of dinner or breakfast, the waiter will be sent to the elevator after the meal; 4. Because the flight is late, I have a try , To reflect, I extended the check-out for free for 2 hours, I was very touched; 5. It took a short time to do the questionnaire survey and gave gifts and surprises; 6. After hanging up ""Do not disturb"", the waiter quietly handed out the card to remind Room cleaning can be done at any time, very good; 7. The location is convenient, to ferry, South Putuo, Xiamen University, etc., 2 yuan air-conditioned bus to get it, cooler and more spacious than taxis; there are many, not to mention one by one. When I went to Xiamen, I didn't live in Xiamen Hotel 10 years ago. I stayed this time and I will live here in Xiamen later! "
1	Cost-effective intel X25-M hard drive sold, replaced by ordinary SATA hard drive, a netbook is less than 2000, beautiful appearance, all aluminum body 
0	General conditions, that is, the location is good, it is relatively close to the city center, and travel is relatively convenient. 
1	excellent service. The hardware facilities are 3 stars, and the service can reach 4 stars. From the time I got off the car to the room, someone helped to carry my luggage without touching my hand. There are few parking spaces, so you need to inform the reserved parking spaces in advance. The location is very good, not far from the city hall, very close to the pier and the sea. But it is not a hotel near the sea. Sanitation is also good, but the hot water is relatively small. Generally speaking, the service is very good, the hygiene is very good, and the hardware is normal 3 stars. 
0	It's too bad, I advise everyone not to be fooled! ! ! I have lived in the deluxe standard rooms 5503 and 6603, mainly for internet access, which is weird. The internet in business hotels costs 10 yuan/day. After paying 10 yuan, the internet speed is so fast. No. That's so exciting! There is no central air conditioner in the room, a Haier air conditioner is hung up, and a breath of cold air does not work at all, and weird movements are constantly made. The toilet is a kind of independent shower room, but there is actually no partition between the two pieces of glass. Once you take a bath, the water fills the Jinshan Mountain, and the whole toilet is full of water on the floor (it seems like that in guest houses). I found out that the toilet paper ran out, and I found N numbers for the guest room center to send them. They said they would send them soon, and they didn't send them all night. They seem to never give guests the welcome card outside the room card, only an IC card. Many guests may not remember their room number. In addition, the room numbers are also very mentally handicapped. There are rooms 503 and rooms 5503. My room is stabbed by someone with an IC card N times a day, no matter if you are in the morning, at night or in the night, or if you sleep in a daze. The most frightening thing was that on the night before I left, a customer used an IC card to poke my door and couldn't open it, so he knocked on the door and kicked it. The waiter opened my door next to the door at three o'clock in the middle of the night, and I yelled: What are you doing! I just said: I'm sorry sir, I'm sorry! 
0	1: Heat dissipation is the biggest problem. The heat dissipation of the left hand rest is too large and the design is unreasonable. 2: It is very troublesome to install XP on Cow, but buy a system installation disk with hard disk drive, partition the hard disk first, and install the system. 
1	R400 is good ~ the price is not expensive ~ or it was made when it was snapped up ~ haha. It's very easy to use~ It's a big name, it feels different to use 
0	The speed of the pre-installed Vista is unpleasant, and the keyboard feels a bit soft, and the shell feels not so strong, it seems very thin 
1	Support as always, good hotel, just a little bit more service. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you for your long-term care and support for our hotel. Our hotel is about to declare a four-star hotel. While we are transforming the hardware, we also strengthen and upgrade the software services, and strive to make every All guests are satisfied. The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to five-star standards, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
1	Very ordinary hotel, because I can't book Gandian, reluctantly check in 
0	I just checked in and found that the carpets and chairs in the room were wet. When I called to inquire, the front desk only explained why the chairs and carpets were wet. I didn't feel any apology. In the end, only two chairs were changed, which was really uncomfortable. There is still a distance from the five-star service. 
1	The pictures and content are very much to my appetite! ! Reading the illustrations in the book feels like watching the cat and mouse animation. Very funny~~ The kid boy is three and a half years old, and he really likes it too! ! Watch it every day these days-watch it when you wake up, watch it when it's okay, watch it when you shit! He also likes Carmen very much. During this time, he always said that he was Carmen. Maybe he thinks Carmen is smart and can fight again! The pages are not big, 32 open small, easy to hold. The paper is very good! ! The only thing in the book that is not very good is the section where Carmela and Pidick are in love. I plan to buy another set for my colleague's baby! ! 
1	The sea view is good, which is the best in Weihai. The service is okay, but it didn't impress. The facilities in the room are not bad, but they are in good condition, which is worse than the Blue Sky Hotel. I think the breakfast is not much better than the 38, but it costs 68 yuan. The soundproofing of the room is very poor. I checked in a few people next door and started singing and then playing cards. I heard very clearly. 
1	The traffic location is very good, the service facilities are OK. But the price is a bit high, maybe the reason for the higher prices of hotels in Taiyuan! 
0	The room is large and the waiter is polite and courteous. Unfortunately, everything else is too bad. The room is full of musty smell. The bathroom is full of water. I get attacked by mosquitoes every night. The electric mosquito coils are all useless. Star. Too disappointed.... I have stayed in many hotels all over Asia and Americas. This hotel is far from 4-Star hotel....Whoever gave this hotel the 4-star rating should have his/her head examed . Very very disappointed !!! 
1	Each of Chairman Mao’s thinking methods in the book have to be read several times before they can be deeply understood. It is helpful to daily life and work. If you really understand it, you can raise your thinking level to a level. At first glance, this book is quite abstract, but in fact, you have to follow the author's context and your own thinking to read, it is very important. To be a reference book is to take a book with you. Just take a look at it when you have nothing to do. It will allow you to continuously improve yourself. I bought four by myself, kept two by myself, and gave the other two to my original colleague. 
0	It's not as good as the comments say. Very general, the text feels bad, and it does not reflect the unique beauty of that era. 
1	The location is good, in the bustling downtown area, it is very convenient to go to Tianjin Street and Qingniwa. There is a tram not far downstairs; I live in a mini-standard room, but it is bigger than I thought. There are 17, 8 flat bar; services and everything are pretty good, but I think it’s not good. Internet access is actually charged, 20 yuan/day, but I also have time and hope that it will be free in the future; TV can be received from Korea, Japan, the United States, and Hong Kong Waiting for the station, but some stations are not clear 
1	Very good value hotel, worthy of the price, but the Internet access steps are more troublesome and the Internet speed is average. 
0	Moved. There is also a heart-wrenching sorrow. After reading it, I will never forget it. I am afraid of being filmed into a movie and TV, which will destroy the beautiful image of the character in my heart. Too moved 
1	The price-performance ratio is still quite high. The book is sold locally for 6,999 yuan, and the front desk discount is 99 yuan. It is estimated that it is almost the same to find the boss for 300~500 cheaper. 
1	This time I bought a new series. I haven’t used it before. The running speed is not bad, the appearance is very beautiful, and the screen is much better than before. 
1	After reading line by line and word by word, the workplace philosophy contained in the eight stories is thoughtful. Contrasting novels, looking back at the road I have traveled, I found that without the guidance of predecessors, the road to the workplace is to cross the river by feeling the stones, and it is a person who has overcome difficulties. Fortunately, it is not too late to see you. Fortunately, you light up the long way ahead of me. 
0	It’s troublesome to install the system. XP needs to be changed to IDE, and then back to ACHI. It’s a bit slow to install Vista, and it may not activate 
0	Yushan Hotel's service is very poor, it is bad that I have never seen. The counter moves slowly, the attitude is fierce, the face is stinky, the room is cold and damp without air conditioning, and the restaurant is even worse. It may be government-owned, don't care. 
0	Reading this book, the original intention is to add some knowledge and understand yourself, but the result is not achieved, the text is long, the content is not like, and I feel uncomfortable~ 
1	Very good hotel, I stayed in a room with RMB 290 on the 19th floor. You can have a bird's eye view of the entire Xining city and the mountains in the distance, which is very beautiful. The hotel is very clean, the service is very good, the facilities are complete, the restaurant is open for a long time, there are two ATMs, you can buy train tickets on your behalf, the business center is also very friendly, the hotel is large, the location is very good, in Xining It’s very convenient to walk to the central square (equivalent to Shanghai’s People’s Square), and there is a carpooling point (Xiali car 8 yuan/person) next to the hotel to the Tar Monastery. The hotel is adjacent to the state guesthouse where the leaders of the country stayed. It is quiet in the noisy, very quiet and very safe (we often see the police guarding it). Generally speaking, it meets my requirements and is a very cost-effective hotel. Stay here next time you come to Xining, ha ha. 
0	Advantages: (1) The room is okay and relatively spacious. (2) The bath is good and the water is relatively large. Disadvantages: (1) The doorman at the door was SB. He didn't help when he saw that I took the box. He didn't even open the door and made serious complaints. (2) Seriously admiring foreigners! ! ! ! Seeing a Korean is the same as a dog seeing its owner, seriously despising it! ! ! ! You brought the box to the Koreans and didn't see you tip, splash! ! ! ! ! ! (3) The standard room is set, God! ! ! From the lobby, turn left and walk 30 meters, turn right and walk 30 meters, turn left, turn right and walk 30 meters, and then go upstairs with a big box, what a bad hotel! ! ! ! ! There is not even an elevator. (4) Still a doorman! ! Ask them to call a taxi for help. They are all black cars, and the surrounding area is relatively biased. You can't get a taxi at all! ! ! ! Serious complaints. It was only 70 yuan to the airport (with high-speed fare) and was cheated by 100. ! ! ! ! ! 
0	I bought it after reading many good reviews, but I was so disappointed that I threw it on the floor after reading it. Angry. I didn't see what was good, whether it was the language or the story. 
1	The vulgar is the elegant! This is the most sincere feeling after reading Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's three books. I have read the history of Chinese literature, the history of Chinese woodcut paintings and this history of Chinese popular literature. I have always found historical discourses the most difficult to read, with many contents and a long history. Generally I feel that such books must be inquiring homes for universities, and the language expression has left us ordinary people behind. However, although Mr. Zheng's book is about history, it is thoroughly read and not at all obscure. Ordinary people can best The accepted text conveys ancient Chinese classics~~~ Recommended collection! ! ! Looks like there is a complete works of Mr. Zheng~~Unfortunately, there is not much money~~~ 
0	The pre-installed vista system runs slowly. I modified XP and took a lot of effort. The drivers need to be installed one by one, which is very troublesome. The shell of piano paint is beautiful but easy to leave fingerprints 
0	The keyboard is a bit soft, it seems like pressing it harder, the time is not 9.5 hours, many people have said it! Average speed 
1	The appearance is good, the workmanship is good, the heat dissipation is very good, it is the best I have seen, better than imagined, the price is affordable, and the satisfaction 
0	The book is full of truths, which may be known in daily life, but there are very few practical implementations. The book just made some generalizations and summaries, and there is no new idea. I only turned over the whole book for 1 minute. 
1	Nice hotel, service is ok, will stay next time~ 
1	The appearance of the machine is very good, clean, tidy, and feel good. Perfect screen and great sound effect. The price/performance ratio is quite good, and I think the books within 5000 are quite worth. 
0	"I really don't know what kind of people the audience is aimed at. Does this kind of boring novel with boring writing and content satisfy the eccentricity of looking up to the small staff outside the Fortune 500 circle, or does it deceive the fresh talents who have never stepped into the society to figure out the situation and become so popular? After reading dozens of pages, I can’t turn it down, full of pretentious plot settings and dialogues, a book that will become an idiot after a long time. To take a TV drama as an example, Cao Ying’s version of ""The Pretty Lady in Law"" can be compared with it~ I feel sooooo sick..... "
1	"I suddenly remembered that many years ago, when I was still in elementary school, I remembered that I participated in an essay contest once, and the title was the photo in ""Father and Son"". It’s a classic look at pictures. I saw this book that day, I suddenly remembered this old thing. My childhood is much better than my current life~~~ There is a very warm feeling, which is probably called ""The power of family affection""... sure enough, the more ordinary it is, the more touching it is, isn't it? "
0	Relatively speaking, compared with the hotels in Dongguan and Shenzhen, the service quality of this hotel is still slightly flawed. Slightly lacking enthusiasm and politeness, a little indifferent. For example, on the last night of staying at the hotel, they forgot to give new slippers. I made a total of three calls before sending them. Looking at the hotel environment at that time, it didn't seem to be very busy. 
0	The hotel is relatively old, does not meet the four-star standard, and travel is not very convenient. 
1	I feel pretty good, LCD TV with computer. Good location 
0	The style of Little Japan, the figures are small, it looks laborious, and the content is not nutritious. A book can be done in 1 hour! 
1	The environment is relatively good, as a local upgraded four-star hotel in Liuzhou, it is quite good! The attitude of the waiter is also very good. Domestic long-distance calls in the room are free, which is only available in Liuzhou area! More distinctive! 
1	"The book ""Onmyoji. Qingming Removal of Tumors"" was bought and kept on the shelf for a long time. When did I buy it when I was finished. Look at it when you see that you just can't fall asleep while tidying things up. After reading it, I felt a little funny. Are ghosts in ancient times more stupid? Fortunately, ghosts in Japan are more stupid? Because looking at modern ghost stories, it is said that those ghosts are very shrewd and cunning. All I want to ask is Seimei, isn’t there a shikigami? Why doesn't Shikigami help me when I have something to do? The summary is all good, so I want to buy a few other ones to see the complete. "
0	"When I saw the title of the first book ""I Want to Watch the Sea"", I thought it was very cute, and then I found the content to be quite imaginative, haha, yes, it should stimulate the imagination of children~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ "
1	Quiet in the noisy, although the facilities are a bit old, the view of the room facing the Huangpu River is very good, the only bathing water temperature is still hot and cold, please check again, this problem is more serious, especially when children are bathing. The service is very good. Hotel feedback April 16, 2008: First of all, thank you for your affirmation of the scenery and service of our hotel. The water pipe of the hotel will be further maintained and maintained to improve the existing hardware facilities, thank you! 
1	It's not bad to use, I still have a few 2000-100 1000-50 East coupons plus qq 673946022 
1	Win7 is fully compatible, just install the acpi driver manually. ubuntu9.04 is fully compatible, it is recommended to install eeebuntu3.0, which can support soft switch Bluetooth wireless camera. 
1	"I basically finished reading it in four nights. It is a novel that is easy to read, and it looks very relaxing. I like the language very much, and the Shaanxi dialect is very familiar with the image. I feel that this book is based on the county chronicles compiled by ""Mr. Zhu"". Although it is a long story, I don't feel much content. On the surface, it seems that the position of this book is very ""medium"", but the author implicitly prefers our great DOWN. The overall feeling is not very ideological; the harvest is that I have learned a few Shaanxi dialects and spent a fairly relaxing time. Give it three and a half stars, but I don’t know how to give it a half star, just four stars. "
0	Sometimes I hear individual squeaking sounds, as if the video driver is not convenient to download. Later, if the driver is not installed, it can be used in confusion. 
0	I didn't like prose at first. I read it because of Zhang Ailing. Half of the time I read it, I felt bored. Maybe it was because he lost Zhang Ailing and didn't like the author even more. I didn't plan to finish it. 
1	The hotel room is not bad, worthy of the five-star title. The breakfast variety is also rich. Disadvantages The hotel is close to the main road and the floor is too low to sleep a bit noisy at night. 
1	The service is good and the waiter is very friendly. The best thing is that the room is big enough. . The layout of the writing desk is very good. The transportation is also very convenient and the surroundings are also very lively. It is very cheap to walk to the stalls on the top floor of Zhongmin Parkway in 10 minutes. The taste is also good. The only downside is that the breakfast was received a bit early. 
0	Since the books to be bought are not complete in Dangdang and Zhuozhuo, the order was placed on the two websites at 12:23 on June 1, 2008. Zhuozhuo will review and ship in half a day. Two days later, Dangdang is still waiting for review. 2008-06-04 9:30, when the excellent book has been received, Dangdang is still waiting for review. It took another full day to pick up the goods, and the delivery time was 2008-06-04 13:37. I thought it might be that the time for the distribution review is slow, and the arrival should be fast (express delivery to Jinan city in 2-3 days). But now it is 2008-06-09 11:40, and I don’t know where the book is. I just called 400-711-6699 to ask when it will arrive. After waiting for two minutes, I said that I couldn't hear my voice after I connected, and then I hung up! ! Angry! ! ! ! Dangdang, buying a book from you for the first time, is so disappointing. 
1	The hotel room is not bad, worthy of the five-star title. The breakfast variety is also rich. Disadvantages The hotel is close to the main road and the floor is too low to sleep a bit noisy at night. 
0	The speed of the pre-installed Vista is unpleasant, and the keyboard feels a bit soft, and the shell feels not so strong, it seems very thin 
0	The first time I bought Lala’s promotion note, it arrived in three days (I live on the edge of Beijing Third Ring Road), and I am quite satisfied. Second, I bought the book <Ming Dynasty>, which was ordered on June 22. I didn’t receive it in a week. I called customer service. I always answered that I’m sorry. I haven’t received it in two weeks. I received it when I was about to stand up. Dangdang’s text message said that the order could not be found and asked me to reorder. Is there such a shameless service in the world? When I reordered, I found that the discount for the book was 10% less, which means the price increased. Call the customer service again. The customer service saw that my order date was more than half a month ago, and agreed to apply for a gift certificate before re-ordering, and promised that the gift certificate would arrive in the account in the afternoon. I waited and waited, and waited for another day and a half, but still didn't have any gift certificates. But today, that is, July 10th, the book I ordered finally came to me at a speed beyond thinking. Dare to ask Dangdang, is this your consistent style? How do you plan to compensate for the loss of physical discomfort caused by the angry bad emotions that have caused me? 
1	"I don’t know how many mainland audiences have watched Taiwan’s ""Life Wisdom King"" program, which introduces many life skills, especially home cooking. This book specifically introduces the methods and techniques to make delicious, non-heavy and healthy meals in a short period of time. It is very suitable for the busy people in modern society (or lazy people), as well as some tips to improve cooking efficiency. The pictures are very intuitive, and the text is a bit simpler. It is much more practical to master the skills. It is much better than eating fast food or takeaways, and it can also enhance the relationship with your family~ "
1	It should be said that it is the more value-for-money one of the notebooks over 12 inches. The thin and light shell is aluminum alloy. Although the bottom is made of engineering plastics, the overall heat dissipation is still good. It should be said that the feel of the keyboard is relatively easy to use in the notebook I have used, and the touch panel is also easy to use. The standby time has not been tested. 
1	The location of the hotel is very close to the railway station, less than 10 minutes walk. . . The service is good, there are fruit baskets, but some of the fruits are a bit rotten. . . I think if you want to give it, you should give it a little better, or just don't give it. . . The hotel is generally good and the rooms are also very good. . 
1	Cost-effective, strong, stable, and quiet. The most important thing is that I bought it at 5488 yuan (6.11 limited time limit purchase). No one is lower than me. Haha. It’s a great value. Unfortunately, it’s out of stock. I wanted to add a 1G Samsung memory. 199 yuan rose to 269 yuan. . . Regret not making a move 
1	1. The battery time is long, 5-6 hours of normal use is no problem, and it can be used for nearly 7 hours with little use. I like it very much. 2. The keyboard is more comfortable. 3. The screen brightness is not bad. 
0	The fan's voice is loud, and Vista is simply tasteless. I originally wanted to buy V045PA (only 1G memory, dos) for only 4888 yuan. Today, I saw the cash back of 200 yuan. I regret that I didn't listen to my friends. 
1	After reading, she likes the author's delicate emotions and writing very much. She reproduced many situations that may be encountered in urban life on the protagonist of the novel, so that we who read books can empathize with us, and deal with these problems and the negative emotions that we often encounter. Finding the most fundamental reason deep in my heart confirms the author’s point of view: “When something outside touches you, remember and forget to look inside.” After reading the whole book, my mood was very calm and I felt that way. I don't know how to express it. It seems to have a faint sweetness, very light, not tiresome, and very beautiful. 
1	Ctrip does not bring breakfast, so I can’t evaluate what I eat. Generally speaking, the decoration is good and there are no major problems. Parking is charged for 20 or more a day, and finally reimbursed at the front desk. The air conditioner is quite adequate and it is a bit overheated. It's very good to live in such a hotel at this price. It feels more suitable for a family trip. The expensive thing is to stop the Internet, it's darker. 
0	The content is rich, very suitable for parent-child reading, the color pictures are appropriate and vivid, my son and I read it again, and my son will remember the wonderful stories inside 
1	It comes with a driver CD, and there are VISTA and XP drivers on the CD, which is a fool-like automatic installation. After installation, it can be used normally. The mold is exactly the same as F80, there is no difference. The heat dissipation is acceptable. 
1	The appearance is old, the parking lot is small and messy, and additional money is charged, but the hotel is clean. 
0	Obviously it can be seen that it is a low-end model, with a strong sense of plastic, and the workmanship is only slightly better than that of the Godship. There are only two usbs, and they are all on the left. The heat dissipation is very poor, and the C side is like a steamer. No package... 
1	The notebook is good, it is good to use, and the pick-up is fast. The order was placed in the early morning of May 29, and the pick-up was in the afternoon. The notebook is also good, the portable hard disk is very delicate, and the THINKPad feels good. 
1	The lobby of the hotel is relatively small, but the environment and sanitation are satisfactory, and the rooms are also good, except that the bathtub is a bit old. Free domestic long-distance and local calls are also provided. Even though the windows are closed at night, some bars or nightclubs can still be heard. The quality of the breakfast is a bit different from the four-star. 
1	The designated business double room, the room is too small, but the economy hotel is like this; the environment is average, the surrounding feels quite chaotic, but there is an Yichu Lotus Supermarket next to it, which is very convenient for shopping; the service is relative to the other 2 economical hotels The best hotel 
0	The hotels that cannot honor the reservation are the worst hotels in the world, such as this Wanlilu International Youth Hotel. Additional comments January 14, 2008: It was booked, but when I arrived at the hotel, I said there was no room. ... 
1	A heart-wrenching story. If you have ever had a deep crush on someone, then you will definitely understand Xixia, and you will definitely find your shadow. What a painful, true, and beautiful love in a young age. The author’s exquisite description made me wonder secretly that the author must have had such a profound experience, otherwise, how could she write such an unforgettable secret love so deeply. The final outcome is cruel to Shen Jiabai, but happy to Xixia, because I personally think it is a happy thing to marry Spring. 
0	Very bad, it’s not a place where people live. I can’t fulfill the promise of picking up when I booked. I had to drag my luggage and walk for nearly two kilometers to arrive at 11pm. The service attitude is poor. The aisle of the room is humid and full of musty. The light or dark green light flashes (too frequently). It is far from the other two stars I have lived in. 
1	The overall performance is relatively balanced (the graphics card is slightly weaker), and the appearance is stylish (bought for the niece, more suitable for girls) 
0	Checked a lot of travel notes and chose this hotel. Very disappointed, I suggest you not to live in the future. When I arrived at the front desk, the lady at the front desk talked to my colleagues in Cantonese and decided which room to give me. I asked for a higher floor and gave me the 9th floor. The door smelled of smoke. The rooms are small and the facilities are poor. From Tongluo Bay, you have to cross the sky bridge to reach the hotel. Every time you come back from buying good things, you have to walk over the bridge. I would rather stay at Pening Hotel, close to Sogo, and do not need to take the sky bridge. Because it was a red-eye flight, I asked for a delayed check-out and gave the child a nap, but I refused. The service is too bad, and it is not four-star standard. If it is in Hainan, Samsung will not be rated! It is recommended that you bring children not to stay in this hotel. 
0	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in, I suspect that all the comments above are the hotel’s trust, and it is the only four-star hotel in Hengshui. When I first entered the room, there were melon seeds on the floor. The room was very bad and the service attitude was very poor. , There is still a smell in the room. Will never live again. 
1	1. The environment is good, very close to Dongbai, just behind Dongjiekou. 2. The rooms are nice, with computers and free internet access. 
0	The location of the hotel is very partial, the lobby is very beautiful, but the room has a freshly renovated smell, the room is dark and the bed is also low, giving a depressing feeling. After checking out, the hotel feedback to Ctrip that the guests did not check in as scheduled, which also made the guests uncomfortable. 
1	Because of work, I go to live every month. It is the best choice to live in Jinhua city about 400. 
0	The service attitude needs to be improved. First: the arrival is 2 days late. Second: the package is wrong. The laptop of 14 is given the package of 13. I guess someone has the laptop of 13 with the package of 14. Third: the customer service phone is difficult to get through , Get through and say two sentences and make people wait for three minutes 
1	The configuration is relatively balanced, which is completely enough for people with low computer requirements, and Lenovo’s services are worthy of recognition. The machine has not had any major problems so far. It is much better than the macro? Two hours after I placed the order, it went up by 200. Fortunately, the shot was quick, and it hasn't dropped yet! Recommend this! 
1	The hot springs are good, the others are very average. The bathroom is small and old. The hotel in the scenic spot is just like that. 
0	The location of the hotel is not good. The doorman called for a taxi to go out. It took 10 minutes for the doorman to call the car. Slow! The shower shower is not big at all, and it doesn't match the five-star hotel facilities! The strangest thing was that when I checked out, there was someone who checked in and it seemed to be booked through Ctrip. The front desk was actually telling him that you can cancel Ctrip’s reservation. Our current front desk price is lower than Ctrip’s. What other discounts are there? Really, the customer cancelled Ctrip's reservation and checked in at the price given by the front desk. If you don’t believe Ctrip, you can check if I canceled the hotel reservation at about 11 noon the day I checked out. It seems to be a Taiwanese. 
1	"The book caught her daughter's attention as soon as she took it home. She told me to talk four times in a row, but it was not enough, and she asked me to talk again before going to bed. I asked her who did you think this book was drawn by. She glanced at it and said, like ""Gorilla"". Ha ha! It is also a book that my daughter likes very much. There is a stage where I talked about it for 2 weeks. In the recent period, my daughter is like the brother and sister in the book. I can't see my sister thinking, but she often quarrels when we meet. Nowadays, children all have ""donkeys alone"", and they always consider their own feelings when they get along with their peers. Give this book to my daughter, I just hope she cherish the affection. "
0	General heat dissipation, general standby (less than 2 hours), slow start-up, and good running speed. 
0	I bought it only after seeing the ranking, but the book is big and messy. None of them are all paintings. I don't like it, but my son is fine. As a storyteller, I don’t seem to feel it, so I can’t get involved. 
0	I stayed at the store five times the night before returning from Hefei to Taiwan for the convenience of the flight. The check-in speed was slow and the staff still chatted with each other. The room lighting was far from adequate, the internet speed was slow, and the attitude was poor. , The bathroom even the shower is omitted, only a curtain is left. What's even more outrageous is that the air conditioner was cut off at 12 o'clock in the evening when I was staying in the hotel, and I was notified at 11, so it was too late to change the hotel. Anyway, there are many meetings in Wangjiang, and there are many people living in government agencies, so I don't care about us retail investors. Attention friends who will stay next time! 
0	A book that teaches women how to make a completely material assembly line product. Koreans are really very material. This book is a good reflection. A normal person has thoughts and emotions, and because of this, society will be very Colorful. 
1	The reason for choosing this book is very simple-cost-effective, the price of 4299 is the best in the configuration of the same price, directly add memory to 3G, after the Aion, the special effects are fully opened and very smooth 
0	After plugging in the power source, the power adapter is hot enough, and the sound is not very loud, and other shortcomings will take more time to know. 
1	The content is great, the illustrations are relaxed and humorous, the language is easy to understand, not tired to read, and the psychological description of cats made me understand more about cats. That day, I observed the stray cats that frequently haunted the garden downstairs in the community. , After a male cat sniffs the urine of another female cat, because of the satisfaction of the smell, the expression he reveals is really grinning. It’s amazing. When I tell the people around me, many People are surprised and magical. Although many people have cats, many people have never really understood the psychology of cats. This book is really wonderful. 
0	The display screen is a defective product, and I have to change it sooner or later. There will be a lot of mosaics at a 45 degree angle. The particles are very large. The XP system is more troublesome for the first time. The camera is only 30w, not the so-called 130w. There is a Bluetooth cable and it is reserved Space, but it’s very slow to read the disk without installing the optical drive directly 
0	"I ordered six books, but only five came. The only one missing was ""Twenties, Determines the Life of a Woman"". And after the paper box was torn apart, it was glued together with wide tape. Could it be that after the goods were matched, they were torn apart and then glued together? ? ? ? ? ? "
1	Stayed in Room 81118 of Building 8, the service staff was very warm and thoughtful, the room was clean and the breakfast was rich. The bathroom was slightly outdated. 
1	Overall it is good. In view of the national conditions, the price is still relatively high. But if there is no car, this hotel is not recommended. We asked the past all the way. The road signs are not bad. The custom-made garden-view room faces the swimming pool. Although it was late, I went for a short swim. It feels good. But what I want to mention is the front desk service, which is really not four-star. Commenting on Samsung is also a relief. When I checked out, I left me on the side for a full 20 minutes. After all the other guests’ problems were solved, they still ignored me, or I took the initiative to mention the room number again. The other party actually said that I didn’t tell them. And I obviously heard the call from the ward round ten minutes ago stating that the inspection has been completed. This needs to be improved. 
1	Older hotels, rooms and other facilities are also older, the service is still OK 
1	LED screen, fast delivery. The goods arrived in about a day and a half, and it’s not bad, not bad 
1	When I watched it again, I was excited whenever I thought of seeing this book when I went home. I was also immersed in the story, following the ups and downs of the characters in the story. I especially liked Yuan Tianhuan. If it were made into a TV series, who would Come to play this character with great tension and story. After thinking and thinking about it, there is no... or this person exists in each of us! Now that I have finished reading Queen Ce and read other books, I still can’t get out of Queen Ce, and I still feel that the book I am reading now is not so enjoyable! Recommended collection 
0	The service is extremely poor, the price is high, the location environment is partial, and the room condition can be one star... 
0	The three usb ports are all on the left. It is very inconvenient to connect the mouse and I don't understand the designer's idea. . . . . 
1	The hotel is very nice and cost-effective. Although in the bustling section of Luoyang, I had a very quiet rest at night and I slept well. At the same time, it is more convenient to go to Longmen. There are buses, and you can reach Longmen for about 24 yuan by taxi. 
1	Overall it is very good, the environment is very good, especially the breakfast, very good and very competitive. I have compared the breakfasts of several four-star hotels in the past few days of the New Year, and it is still the best in his house. 
0	A super bad book, I can’t read it after I bought a full set, and Dangdang has overblown it and misleads consumers. 
0	The hotel is aging, the room decoration is poor, and the service is too blunt. The half-day room rate will be charged for less than two hours after the noon check-out time. Other hotels basically consider humanity and do not charge this fee. 
1	In Qingdao, this hotel is really average and the location is OK, but the door is very difficult to call a car. In fact, there are many cars waiting for it but only go to the airport. They don't go for short distances in the city, and the concierge also ignores it. In terms of service, it is very common among many hotels in coastal cities and has no special features. I believe there are many better choices in Qingdao! 
0	It’s hard to install the system. It’s best to find a professional. I’ve found someone to install it three times! After the first two installations, the computer slapped, and the last time I found someone from a specialty store to install it, it’s very good, but the fan is a little louder. . 
1	"The book ""The Human Body Has Its Own Medicine"" is of great help to daily life. Especially my patients with shoulder and neck inflammation who work hard on the computer these days, so I take the book with me every day, and if I feel uncomfortable, just follow the instructions in the book to find out the high point corresponding to the problem, massage for a few minutes, and press The more painful the place, the faster the body's problems will be relieved. I feel that the effect is quite good. Thanks to Dr. Wu Guozhong for broadcasting this good book and benefiting all beings. Thanks! I recommended more than ten friends to read this book, and bought a few for the elderly at home. If they get a treasure, they love it and benefit a lot! "
1	This screen is so cool, I haven't noticed anything. The reflection is not strong. The 300,000-pixel camera is quite clear. The battery can last for 3 hours. 
1	In addition to Apple, I like the design of ThinkPad. Classic appearance, good price/performance ratio, and balanced configuration in all aspects. My favorite is its own camera. My colleague is a relatively careless person, so he didn't pick him up with a hardworking machine like Xiao Hei. 
1	I just came back from Nanjing yesterday. I picked Jingli after repeated comparisons before I went. I feel that whether it is the doorman, receptionist, or restaurant waiter, they have all been well trained. The doorman uncle also introduced in detail how to get to the Confucius Temple. (Because it is rush hour, it is difficult to get a taxi) The selected business single room is on the 11th floor of the top floor. Although it is close to the road, it is still quiet 
0	I asked for a quiet room. . Who knew that when I lived on the 6th floor that day, the wind outside was blowing miserably, and the sound was loud, and it took an hour to fall asleep. Let the hotel change rooms. They said that there are no trees around the hotel and every room is very loud. . Hehe, is there a reason here? It seems that next time, when the wind blows, I can't live. 
1	Although I booked a standard room this time, when I arrived, I changed to a newly renovated business single room, and it still smelled a little better. I guess it will be gone in a few days. Although the room is not very big, it feels good overall. It is clean and tidy. There is no place to hang clothes in the room. I have already advised the hotel and it is estimated that it can be resolved soon. The location of the hotel is ok, not far from Chunxi Road. Overall I feel good value for money, it is worth staying. 
1	The hardware is very good, the quality of service is also very good, especially the surrounding environment of the hotel is very elegant. Breakfast is also good, next time I go will stay 
0	A very simple story, but it contains the protagonist’s bumpy life. To live is pain, and I have to admire the toughness of life 
0	Seeing so many recommendations, I also bought a set for my baby. I only read one? I want to have a star?, it doesn't feel very good, and the baby doesn't like it very much. Maybe it's still young and can't understand it 20 months). It's a bit strange how so many people recommend 
1	The delivery came in the afternoon, and it took one night to finish reading. Then the book spread wildly in the office, and Teacher Hou was also liked by more people. I really like what he said. The more I grow up, the simpler things I find are valuable. Those childhood stories have little joy and bitterness, but on the whole they are so beautiful. I especially like the story between him and his sister, and I saw the friendship between a little man and a little hate. Suddenly I think it's nice to have a brother. In short, I am very grateful to October Literature and Art for introducing this book to the mainland. Teacher Hou’s writing is very interesting and worthy of your careful taste. 
1	The hotel hardware and location are good, but the service is irritating. On the day of the 12th earthquake, I checked into this hotel through Ctrip. The next day, because of the delay in work, there was no time to check out. In the afternoon, Ctrip asked if I want to return? But Because it was past 12 o'clock, we requested to extend our stay, but we were told that the price of the two rooms had increased by 40 yuan and 50 yuan. It was said that it was a special price on Monday and the special price was cancelled on Tuesday. I said that we stayed together for two days. The same price, but the hotel later said that if you booked through Ctrip at that time, you would also have two prices for two days. If you check out, you will be charged a half-day fee. It is also said that hotels above three stars will charge a 10% service charge. In short, it feels like it is. Was slaughtered, I will not stay in this hotel in the future. Supplementary comment May 14, 2008: Make up; due to rain, we have to borrow an umbrella from the hotel and show our housing permit to inform us that we are hotel guests. Unexpectedly, I was told to register first and then charge 100 yuan per person, which lacked humanity. The same thing happened in Phoenix Jiaju Hotel, as long as you show your room certificate to register.

1	1. The front desk is very polite and can respond quickly to customers' reasonable requests. 2． Nice hotel. 3. Would recommend to friends. 
0	Maybe this is not a good reason, but the reason why I like to read books instead of reading information on the Internet is because I like to smell the scent of books. This book may be because of the bad printing ink or some reason, it feels stinky. Good smell. There are some little anecdotes about Chinglish, some little fun, but it feels that it is more useful for people who have a strong Chinese thinking habit to speak English. 
0	A book that feels rather boring. Nondescript. It was very tangled when I watched it, and I have no impression after reading it. The language is boring, and the characters are even more boring. I regret buying it. 
1	For Bai Yan's death, I was sad for a long time. Not for a book for a long time. I am moved and sad for those words in a book that are so close to life. I like Ning Mo's chicness, and at the beginning, I was still puzzled by the soberness of the two of them in the face of love. In the end, Ning Mo responded until the map appeared after Bai Yan died unexpectedly. I realized that they both love each other so deeply. . . . Remembering Ning Mo's words, she told Liang Weiwei that she would rather lose to her than to lose to anyone than to life and death. . . . 
0	The quality of the paper is not good, and the text is slanted. The piracy is very irresponsible. Although Hu Lan is not considered human, the text is still beautiful, but with such a rough paper quality, it is really very handy. Affect reading, 
0	A book that has sold very hot has some truth in it. I just don't like the author's self-righteous tone. I can't stand it anymore when I see it. I am in a bad mood. What to show off? ? ! ! Also, there are a lot of so-called Chinese medicine formulas in the book. I don’t know if the author was born in pharmacy? Otherwise, it's a half-barreled monk who deceives ignorant people and uses other people's beauty-loving psychology. There is no professionalism. A young woman described herself as an expert, making money by selling her mouth, not worth mentioning. Just make people laugh. 
0	Bad luck, there is a bad spot. The industrial feel is general, especially the plastic of the optical drive is like pancakes. 
1	The configuration is good, much higher than the F8H585 I bought here. Delivery is also OK, in fact, it takes a tailwind, but the postage is 186 yuan, wow, robbery! The quality of the bags is good. 
0	The battery life is slightly insufficient, but it is acceptable. The display effect is poor, only suitable for word processing and Internet access. The image processing is seriously insufficient. 
0	The lobby is noisy, the carpet in the room is dirty, the shower faucet in the bathroom is broken, and the towels are yellow. Additional comments September 11, 2007: Although it is known as a 5-star hotel, it feels that its class is very low. Many happy women enter and exit it, which makes people feel uneasy. 
0	I bought it once before, and all the books are pretty good. How come this time? Are all three books of good quality? ? ? But the content is good, 
0	I picked this book on the five-star ranking list. After I bought it, I found that not only the baby didn’t like it, but I couldn’t even read it myself. I didn’t know how so many people would give it to my jumping thinking and difficult words. Rating five stars. 
0	This hotel is a residential building, changed from the 31st floor to a hotel. I stayed in a one-bedroom, one-bedroom unit. Although there is an open kitchen and a cooking stove, there are no cooking utensils. The hall is very large, but it only has a double-seat sofa. The twin room is pitifully small. The bed is only one meter wide. The bathroom is also very small. The shower tank is close to the toilet and sink. The remaining space can only accommodate one person. It is advisable to drink tea in the restaurant downstairs quite economically. The neighborhood is all high-end residential areas, there are no shopping, the price of $370 is really not worth it. 
0	After watching it for a little while, I felt that there was no inspiration, so I gave up. ps: Yu Dan is so famous, it may also be my poor understanding:-) 
1	Lightweight, thin, long standby time, good heat dissipation, good-looking design, aluminum alloy upper panel is still good-looking, and the keyboard feels good. And the screen is not only very thin, but also solid, pressing the back of the screen has no obvious effect. Adding to 3G memory, the speed of running Vista is still average, but it is also possible that the machines I usually use are too good. Preparing to pretend to be XP is probably much better. There is no specific test, but a standby time of 6, 7 hours is still possible. 
0	Partitioning is troublesome, VISTA is not easy to use, it is best to provide system replacement services when WIN7 comes out 
0	I don’t know if it’s summer, it’s a bit hot. The network card is divided into Intel Marvell Realtek. It's a bit difficult to distinguish. You can call 800 to ask. Or use the latest version of everest for identification, both methods are possible. 
1	4399 grabbed it, too cheap! Hahaha. I like it very much. The workmanship is very good and the heat dissipation is also very good! It's so cool! 
0	My son is now two weeks and nine months old, and he usually plays the egg laying game. This time I got the book, not only saw the egg laying game, but also the fishing game, etc., every day he caught me when he saw me Say, mom, let's go fishing outside together~ or? Mom, I lay a big egg, I have a big ass, haha, for you to eat, I am faint~? But from the heart Moved, son, I know how to entertain myself, and sometimes lead his friends to play games. Of course, he is the boss, hehe! 
1	High cost performance, good appearance. GF130M graphics card can be considered in a notebook ~ T4200 is much more cost-effective than T6400, and it is slightly worse in the second level cache. 
0	1. There is a bluetooth button on the panel, which is actually not configured. 2. There is no system CD attached, which is troublesome to reinstall. 3. The performance of the graphics card is slightly weak, and frame skipping occurs when playing large stand-alone games. 4. The heat control is slightly poor 
1	Many people want to engage in Chinese religion and bring in Confucius as a spiritual leader. Many people regard the Analects as moral preaching and want to use it to change the lost Chinese. Xue Yong saw the true modern value of Confucius. The social foundation of his thoughts is citizenship. Society is similar to British classical political philosophy. China's progress (rather than the rejuvenation of a great power) requires civil society, and the Chinese need to establish a respect for classical values. Therefore, China needs modern Confucianism, not religion, preaching, or worship. It is the values and spiritual power of modern society. 
1	The heat dissipation is done very well, the screen effect is gorgeous and there are no dead pixels, the Dolby surround effect is also very good, cost-effective, and the configuration is good. 
0	Next time if I go there, I would rather sleep under the bridge and not stay in this hotel. 
0	"It's been a long time since I finished reading a book so quickly. Can capture the reader's psychology to write stories, the language is simple and fascinating. It can be a good pastime in the fast-paced life. It happens to be teaching Liu Ji's ""Sellers of Oranges"". Most students don't understand him. Students don't like the solemn and cold introduction of Liu Ji in textbooks. I took advantage of this to borrow from the book, and replaced it with a relaxed language, interspersed with a few short stories, the students were very interested and quickly learned some about Liu Ji. I also recommended this book to students. Thank you ""Those Things in Ming Dynasty"". I want to buy a few more books and read on! "
0	I haven't seen this book before I bought it. I heard what they said was a mess. It's enough to turn a few pages. The content is too rough, and it is unique to Koreans. I don't like it very much... 
1	The child just went to school last year. At that time, the elementary school arranged education experts to teach the parents how to train the children. Among them, the teacher mentioned one, pay attention to cultivating children's observation ability, and also proposed some related small games. Later, I found that this kind of book with great search is very beneficial to cultivate children's observation ability, and the pictures and texts in the book are exquisite, and the children also like it very much. Each book in this set of books has a theme, which can not only cultivate children's observation ability, but also increase relevant knowledge and knowledge. Highly recommend it! 
1	I am puzzled that I did not receive the cards in the sixth issue, and I want to collect 24 cards. . Most dissatisfied at this point 
1	I think most people have read this book and it feels good 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the matte keyboard feels comfortable, the configuration is not bad, and the HDMI high-definition interface not only sent the bag, but also sent the ASUS mouse. I hope that Jingdong can mark the things that I bring. I would not sell the HP mouse if I knew there was a mouse. 
0	Like the title.. The author can be described as I don’t know what to say. I wasted my time. She is at best a white-collar writer. A white-collar writer with no literary foundation. I regret reading such books. I want to experience in my own life. It’s okay to record your own footprints. But the problem is that you still publish a book.....I suggest that if you really want to publish a book, you should do it at the same level as Fu Yao. Compared with <Win or Lose>. Not at all One level.. Again, this book is too disgusting. This person is too disgusting. If you don’t believe it, buy it 
1	"[Recommendation] Experts believe that the current financial tsunami triggered by the sub-crisis is just the beginning, and the market situation in the next one or two years will get worse. Whether you are engaged in business management or other business affairs, you should learn more about the current and future Market trends, in order to keep abreast of market trends, I especially recommend the book ""Apocalypse of Financial Crisis"". This book can let you know more about the financial turmoil that broke out in 2008. This book also quotes previous financial turmoil analysis and analysis. A book worth reading. "
0	"Henan people are Henan people! If you don't be fooled once, it is considered a timeless one; in the whole country and even the whole world, the room called economic room is called ""VIP Building"" in Jiyuan, Henan Province, which is really funny! ! ! "
1	First of all, it feels good to get this book. The packaging and paper quality are good. No matter whether the text is compact or not, at least it is very thick. The content inside is very detailed, which is more instructive for people who are about to become or have just become parents, but if you have read some or even many of these books beforehand, I wonder if her role will be compromised. The text in the book is concise and concise, and I have the energy to read it while taking care of the child, and the recommendations are comprehensive, and some of the characteristics of the newborn are spoken in a child's tone, which is very interesting! Now reading... 
1	The words in the book are the most popular and famous words and sentences in the world; the paintings are all extant treasures. Together, the style and grade of the whole book are self-evident. And the production of the book is excellent. Those who like poems and songs can be collected. The most important thing is that the price is also very cute, in my opinion it is really good value for money. As for the content, there is no need to say more about the words and sentences, they are all classic sentences handed down, no different from the famous works. I have limited literary attainments, and it is difficult to make random comments on the authors' comments. It can only be said that value for money is the most appropriate evaluation of this book. 
1	"The child is seven years old. He is a fan of ""McQueen"". I received it yesterday and took it to school today to ""show off"". There is a sentence on each page, which is roughly the same as the plot in the movie story. Every main character has it, but the text does not have phonetic notation. (Phonetic version) means that each page has a word from the text of this story, that is, the scarlet characters. The characters are very large. It is very suitable for children over 5 years old and can recognize some characters. It's just that the names of the two characters ""Mark"" have become ""Amai"" and ""Doctor"" has become ""Dr. Han"". I'm sorry for serious car fans. "
1	Delicate and compact, very suitable for ladies. The price is still a bit expensive, but the basic functions are included. It also comes with a mouse and bag. 
0	I have never understood why this book is so toxic, but I still have to keep a clear head and carefully identify 
0	Very old hotel, the room is dirty and old, but the cleanliness of the beds is acceptable. The TV remote control is not easy to use, the windows cannot be opened at all, and there are some unknown advertisements outside. When I came back at 11 in the evening, I don’t know where the front desk clerk went? I was helpless to find other waiters and told the front desk to call early at 6:00 in the morning, and the front desk had confirmed it. The result was that my mobile phone had an alarm clock function, otherwise I would not be able to catch the plane. When checking out in the morning, I told 2 guests that they need to pay another 2 yuan of urban construction fee (it seems to be this fee, which is required by Gansu Province). When staying in other hotels in Gansu, other hotels are responsible for it. Although the money is not much, it can reflect the service level of the hotel. The only advantage is that this hotel can provide a free pick-up service, but the car that came to pick up should not be the hotel's car, and I kept asking if I could rent his car by myself. However, the master's attitude is quite simple. It is no surprise that such a small city has such a level of service! ! 
0	The last time I stayed in the suite on a business trip, I felt the following points: 1. The room is large; 2. The decoration is very ordinary; 3. It seems that there is no satellite TV program, and I have been online for two nights; 4. The breakfast is extremely general and the dining environment is like a canteen; There are no facilities nearby; 
1	It's too far away. Going to Hong Kong is just to meet your shopping needs. It is not convenient to stay in the hotel and go out. The hotel is on the edge of Tuen Mun, New Territories. It costs $25 to take a taxi to Tuen Mun Center. There are no shopping malls and restaurants nearby. I will not choose it next time. Advantages: The facilities are okay, if you spend a day or two on your honeymoon. 
0	Poor, nothing special. I booked a room for 2 days. I had to change the room on the third day. I forgot to take the DV machine in the drawer. The next day, I called the guest room center in the afternoon and told me to reply. The result was no reply; I called the lobby manager to complain and asked for assistance; the reason for the complaint: 1. I don't know why no one found the items left by the guests in time when changing rooms in a four- or five-star hotel, and notified the guests in time. Her reason was that changing rooms was different from checking out, and the room was cleaned by a waiter the next morning. . . . In short, what Gloria is actually very bad, don't expect anything from him. 
0	"Stayed here on March 28th and March 29th for two nights, 118 per night, the hotel room is poorly decorated, the door is loose and loose and cannot be locked (relying on a button to prevent full opening). The bathroom part of the bathroom is a lead pipe Hanging her head, I arrived too late in the evening on the 28th and did not wash. On the 29th, she found that there was no hot water. After responding to the waiter, her first reaction was: ""You reversed the direction of the hot and cold water."" I stayed here 2 Can't tell the difference between hot and cold water at night? Then: ""You have to put it on for a while."" She put it on herself, but it was not warm enough to take a bath. In view of the quick one-day experience in Xining, I asked her to talk to the boiler room and raise the water temperature. She said: ""Our masters are all professional and know what to do."" After half an hour without hot water, we decided to go to the ""Xinhua Hotel"" (next to Xinhua Bookstore) as suggested by other netizens. The decoration was much better than this one, only 100 nights. Summary: The facilities are almost okay, but the customer's fault is the customer's fault when the waiter speaks. The customer is not professional enough and the customer doesn't know anything. It doesn't matter if we can't live like this. So score 1 point. Hotel Feedback April 24, 2008: First of all, thank you VIPs for their valuable comments to our hotel. After seeing your comments, we attach great importance to it and immediately made improvements. The magnetic card lock in the guest room comes with a self-locking, and guests are absolutely assured of safety. The hotel is known for its safety. There are security guards and service personnel on duty 24 hours a day. Each corridor has public areas with closed-circuit monitoring. The hotel implements militarized management. Some rooms in the north building only have showers. If you need a bathtub, you can ask our staff to change rooms, or indicate the room with a bathtub in the reservation form. Due to the large number of our rooms, the boiler room is a bit far away from a few rooms, and the water pipeline is correspondingly longer. Therefore, these rooms need to drain the cold water in the pipeline to have hot water. The hot water in this hotel is guaranteed to have a minimum water temperature It cannot be lower than 75 degrees to deliver to the guest rooms, but for this situation, it may be that our staff did not explain clearly to the VIP guests, and there are also shortcomings in the tone. This hotel apologizes to the VIP guests. The hotel has taken the matter seriously. Our hotel must prevent this from happening again. We hope that you will be able to provide you with better service next time you stay at our hotel, and we will make more valuable suggestions to the hotel in the future. All staff of Lhasa Plaza Hotel sincerely welcome you. Thank you again for your comment on my hotel. "
1	Checked in for the second time, the boss is very satisfied with the hotel, otherwise he won’t book it, Xixi 
0	Compared with Lenovo's Y450 series, the price is a bit high. You should send an XP driver CD, VISTA is still a bit inconvenient 
1	The appearance is good, the price is cheap, this price can bring this discrete graphics card is very good. The slot also meets its own requirements 
0	It’s just that the deliveryman’s attitude is a bit bad this time. Maybe it’s because I’m busy. I hope I can speak well no matter what. 
1	I have always wanted to buy a non-comic version, but I always feel that the comic version is suitable for students to read, but I can’t find the text-only version, so I bought more than 20 copies and read it first, although I was a little unaccustomed to the comic version at first Reading method, but after reading a few pages, I got used to it, and I feel that this version is better than plain text and has visual effects. No, I immediately ordered the remaining forty copies, but there is still a lack of pages. One copy, I don't know when it will be available, I want to buy it all, collect it, and show it to her when my daughter is older. In short, it is recommended! 
0	The outer surface of the top cover of the machine is piano-baked paint, a veritable fingerprint collector, it seems that you need to get a film to stick it! Vista's system is slower than XP, but with 2G of RAM, the speed is generally okay! The optical drive will beep a few times when it is turned on! There is only one carton, only one C drive, no partitions! 
0	Heat dissipation is a big problem, it is very hot in summer, it is recommended that other users install a battery management software to control it. When I took it home, I disassembled the machine and checked the internal workmanship. I can only say that it is average. The price is correct. 
1	1. The configuration is upgraded than other netbooks, and it feels good 2. The keyboard is more comfortable, and it is chocolate-like like SONY 3. The battery is designed for right-angle turning, so that it will not stick out. Try it for a while, just a little bit of electricity. Use 2 hours,,,, wait for the exact time 
1	Surfing the Internet, running Word, and using Java are all pretty good. The key is the long standby time, which is more than 7 hours the first time. 
0	It may be that I am used to watching the LCD screen of the desktop computer, and I feel that the screen is a little white, and it is not appropriate to adjust it. In addition, the books are indeed a bit heavy. 
1	Small and light~~It is the type of notebook I have always hoped to have~~Now I don’t like to play any games~~So it is very good to go online or watch movies~~qq games~~haha 
1	The rooms are nice, bigger and cleaner. The breakfast was terrible, basically nothing good. 
1	After hesitating for a long time, I finally decided to buy it. It looks pretty. The accompanying operating system is also beautiful. Overall feel good 
0	The writing is really bad. No literary talent. It has nothing to do with foreign companies. I really don't know why there are so many comments on this book. Fudge people. Ha ha. 
0	The whole hotel smells like lamb. It hasn't been heated since November, air-conditioned, but there is no warm air, it is freezing...I searched the whole room and didn't find any service phone in the hotel, only one massage... .... I was awakened by the car horn in the middle of the night, thinking that the window was not closed properly, but later found that it was closed tightly...Only when the TV was turned on, I heard the sound of the train groggyly... 
0	I don't understand why so many people are chasing this book. I was also influenced by the thoughts of Chongzhong. I bought a lot of books in one breath to read for myself and to give away friends. But when I watched it halfway, I couldn't stand it anymore. The whole book is a hodgepodge of patchwork, from various health books that are now popular, or some so-called beauty books copied from somewhere, plus the author's hard work to show off his so-called happiness, it is not readable. Of course, the author is still very smart, knowing what is the selling point, knowing the psychology of women who are already old and about to be old. Maybe it’s not written by a 31-year-old beauty at all, maybe it’s the work of a sloppy, shabby man editor. 
1	"When I first saw it, I might have this question: Is it possible that I didn't say a word of complaint? In fact, in the consciously capable and unconsciously capable parts, the author tells us that complaints should be treated rationally. We must learn to control the emotion of complaining and guide it correctly, so that it can be used by me. One can meditate, and the other can use the law of cosmic attraction to gather ""energy"" to achieve dreams. …………The ""traction"" entrainment mentioned in the book is worthy of careful observation and consideration in daily life. In short, a good book! "
0	"After watching ""The Promise"", I realized that I can actually be a director; after watching ""Female Psychologist"", I realized that I can also be a writer. If I use an idiom in the book to describe this book, I will choose the word ""lack of good news"" without hesitation. The hype of ""Female Psychologist"" is higher than every wave. In fact, this book is not worth reading. First of all, from a literary point of view, this is a pretty bad book. I didn’t have the pleasure of reading in the process of reading. I read 50 or 60 pages. I really couldn’t stand it anymore. Later I bit my head and read it. That’s so much so that I wonder if Bi Shumin got a gun and handwritten it. There is no special character in character creation. It should be said that Bi Shumin still wants to shape the character of the character. The starting point for character creation is the language of the character. However, how similar the language of each person in the book is. Bai Wanfu is supposed to be a cowardly and bad-spoken character, but his language shows that he is humorous and flexible. This is actually a contradiction. A few stories are really nothing, they can only be said to be ""lack of good news."" From a psychological point of view, this book is not worth reading. The techniques and skills of psychology are not reflected. The consultation process of Horton is like an aunt in a neighborhood committee doing ideological work, and she is also a self-righteous and smart aunt! A relatively poor book, I suggest you not read it! "
1	The articles are short and easy to read, and children are willing to read them. After all, they can read the story without much effort. It is quite in line with their reading habits and the ability to concentrate. The articles are quite sensational, and each article is like this. In fact, as an adult, I don’t I like it too much, why do you want to bombard so many stories that make people tears? There are too many comedies in life, even tragic stories need to add a little humor, self-deprecating... But in the end it is soaking in The children in the sugar water see it. To build their gratitude, compassion, and to cherish the happy life of the moment, it may take so much sadness as a comparison... 
1	The airline hotel is good, the rooms are clean and tidy, the location is good, and the price is moderate. 
0	My daughter doesn’t like it very much. I bought it from the introduction and thought it should be good, but when I took it, the story was not very interesting, and the cartoon image was average and dull. My daughter seemed to be a little enthusiastic only when she first bought it. There was no enthusiasm when I opened it. It may be caused by different cultures, it is best-selling abroad, ha ha. In comparison, my daughter still likes the Dudu Bear series very much. There is a question that must be mentioned, which is more offensive. As children’s books, especially children’s books, can publishers control the quality of the ink. The price of this book is very high. Even if it is in children’s books, the smell of the ink is still so choking and too big. I think it's smoky, and children will be willing to take it! I put it in the living room for a week before the taste can basically be seen. Isn’t it too much to print children’s books with this ink? 
0	The soundproofing effect of the room is very poor. If the guests next door make loud noises late at night... The waiter will remind you, but only after you complain 
0	The location is not very good. The traffic is average. It is far from the subway station. Generally, you can only take a taxi. The air conditioner in the room is aging. It didn't feel very good to call the waiter to pay it back. 
0	The author's writing is okay, but the whole article feels too trivial, a bit of a literati moan. Liberals. The author’s character disagrees with, no national standpoint (it can be called a traitor), and romantic 
0	1G memory needs to be added by yourself. I hope that a self-pickup point with a certain scale can set up personnel who can provide technical support. 
1	It takes about 25 minutes from the airport to the hotel, about 37 yuan. The hotel environment is not bad, because I feel very kind because of the reasons I have lived before. It is very close to Fujiazhuang Park. When I went in the morning, I was in time for the rising tide. I picked up a lot of kelp and it tasted really good. It is recommended to take a taxi to Yan's Nest Mountain and then hike to Laohutan. The scenery along the way is very beautiful! The hotel can sell discount tickets to attractions. 
0	I bought it because of its reputation. I transferred it to others because of its reputation. Except as a gift, it has no value to me. All the characteristics of men and women and the solution of family problems described in the article are empty to me. There is no value to refer to, nor can it resonate. . . . . . . 
0	The keyboard still needs to be filmed, the memory problem, I basically don't play games, and I don't need so much memory. Besides, the memory is cheap, it is not a problem. 
0	Why can’t I complete the order after receiving the goods on delivery? Is it just to save a few coupons? 
0	The button for opening and closing is underneath, not on the lid. It is difficult to open with one hand. Inborn defects, the cpu itself brought it, but there is no way, but it can’t reduce frequency and voltage to save power. 
1	Yes, the configuration and the workmanship of the big factory (it should be so) are enough for my home, occasionally doing pictures, writing codes, running simulations, beautiful screen, good heat dissipation 
1	The breakfast is Chinese and some things are strange. There is a charge for parking at the hotel, which should not be. 
1	Just visited on the 1st. The hotel is very old. The ocean view villa is very loud with wooden floors. The rooms are very air-conditioned and not too cold during the day. Mosquitoes are everywhere. The restaurant is so unpalatable. The waiters are too good. The view of the sea is beautiful, and the sea is very far away Into the beach is very bad and dirty too much worse than Sanya 
0	The machine is hotter after a long time, and the heat dissipation is not good. The new machine found a dark spot on the LCD screen. 
1	First of all, the transportation is relatively convenient. It takes no more than 5 minutes from exit c of quarry bay subway station to the hotel. There is a tram diagonally opposite the hotel, which is also very convenient. The rooms are generally good, the poor impression of Hong Kong hotels in the previous impression has improved. Room service is also ok. Good value for money, highly recommended. 
1	Small and cute, the brightness of the LED screen is not bad, and it starts quickly. The battery is almost five hours 
1	Beautiful, good quality, the heat seems to pass, because it has a powerful graphics card, and the display effect is excellent, perfect screen. It is the first time to buy something on Jingdong and I am very satisfied. 
0	My order was sent out on July 17th, but it is August 2nd, and I have not received the goods. How to post comments? There is a phone number on the order. Even if you can't find the address, please call and ask where it is. I hope your website will check it carefully to avoid such problems in the future. 
0	The environment of the special room is very bad. There is only a very small window leading to the hotel aisle, which is a bit like living in a basement. The sewer in the room still had an unpleasant smell. Please choose this hotel carefully. 
1	Very good hotel, close to the sea. Apart from the bad internet connection on the night of the stay, the others are very satisfied. By the way, it is not easy to get out of the taxi, but the scenery on the road outside the intersection is also good, ha ha. 
0	"I must admit that the slogan of this book is really well written, which touched my heart deeply, so I bought both 1 and 2 at once. It's a pity that, in addition to the exquisite printing, there are a few comic illustrations that are okay. The content is really blunt and funny. It doesn't make me unable to help laughing, nor does it attract me to read it all at once. Naturally, the memory of words can't be said to be vivid, profound, and effective. In this case, I feel a little bit deceived, so I have a poor impression of this set of books, and I feel that the ""name"" is much greater than the actual book. I hope that others will be cautious when buying. "
0	Haven't read it yet, and publish it after reading it. I think many people have a strong impression of this book and believe in the public's perspective. Hehe~~ 
1	The hotel is a bit off, (no subway station), there is no shuttle bus after 19:30. The lobby is small and has no facilities. However, the rooms are nice and have sea views. 
1	When I went, the hotel lobby and restaurant were being renovated, and I felt that the lobby was a bit crowded. Due to the decoration of the restaurant, I should have enjoyed the breakfast, but I didn’t enjoy it (they started at 8 o’clock in each room, but I was too late) but the front desk staff was good ! 
1	The appearance is stylish, the configuration is balanced, and the machine has a good heat dissipation. After about a month, it feels good and cheap. 
0	Some hotel staff are not sincere to customers. He said that he would change the room, and lie to you that it was an expensive room. In fact, you downgrade your room. Tell the truth if you don't have a room, don't lie, what attitude. Some rooms have poor privacy 
1	"Popular science children's three-dimensional manual-""Dinosaur Family"" is a book, very suitable for children to challenge their carefulness and patience in their spare time! Children can exercise their brain control ability during the cutting process, and train their persistence during the pasting process. When the dinosaurs are displayed in three-dimensional, apart from knowing the knowledge and names about them, the most important thing is to gain a share. Confidence and sense of accomplishment! Confidence is the first step for children to succeed! It is the internal motivation for self-affirmation! "
0	1. The system is not an advanced version. Jingdong is misleading and a bit sad. 2. If I used Xiaohei before, the texture is not as good as before. 
1	Very good Star Hotel. It is the fourth time to book for our VIP customers. The executive deluxe room booked is very good, but the room is slightly smaller, but it is generally very good and the service industry is very good! Recommended! 
0	Room scheduled for check-in on July 2 on June 26 1. Confirmed on June 27. 2. Call us on the morning of July 2 to upgrade our room. 3. We checked in, but we were sent to the Tianjin Workers' Sanatorium far away from the sea, saying: There are meetings, no rooms, the surrounding ministry sites, the rooms are very musty, and 500 meters away from the sea. It turns out this is an upgrade! 3. Very bureaucratic style. The above is the experience. 
1	Win7 is fully compatible, just install the acpi driver manually. ubuntu9.04 is fully compatible, it is recommended to install eeebuntu3.0, which can support soft switch Bluetooth wireless camera. 
0	The rooms are small, carpeted, insufficient air-conditioning, and poor service. The reservation service should be cancelled immediately.

1	The configuration is OK, although the graphics card is the bottleneck (the score under vista is 4.0), but in terms of cost performance, it is worth watching movies. The sound quality is also OK. This is the most satisfying part. The system runs fast. Consider upgrading to a flagship Version and then install XP 
0	The indicator light is not obvious, there is no uppercase and lowercase indicator light, no Bluetooth indicator light, and the built-in camera imaging effect is poor 
1	I have been using Dior's cosmetics for more than 20 years, and I like skincare and perfume very much. Friends and colleagues recognized that there is a very elegant fragrance behind me. There are even many young girls who always follow me to buy perfume, but they don’t understand elegance. I don’t know how to tell them what elegance is. Read this book , Let me shine, this book can give them what is elegant, how elegant. If there are more girls reading this book, elegant ladies will make this summer beautiful. I have bought a few copies to give to a few friends, and they are well received. 
1	Any textbook, if it lasts for many years, continuous improvement, itself shows that the author is extremely responsible for the reader. This book is an introductory masterpiece in the field of operations research and a masterpiece. A beginner like me, I saw two o’clock in the evening and read more than 100 pages in one breath. It didn’t feel dull at all, but it felt like listening to a good and inviting teacher. See what. Moreover, the author is extremely responsible for attaching a concise introduction to the AMPL language to the book, and understands the reader's mentality that he hopes to get started as soon as possible. In any case, this book is a good book worth buying. 
0	1. The sound of the CD-ROM drive is obviously a problem with the workmanship. 2. The foot pads on the back and the two at the back are obviously not the same height. Put them on the table and press the upper left corner and the lower right corner with your hands to feel it. There are obviously three legs. , Uneven. This is a design problem 3. There are seams on the edges of the screen, which are not tight and easy to get dust. 
1	The book is received, and the speed is okay. The book is comprehensive, it is worth collecting and learning! 
0	The display effect of the screen needs to be improved, 10 inches is still small, not that very eye-catching feeling. 
0	This book makes me feel that it is not worth buying. About Bi Shumin's sharp, free and easy details, it can not be reflected in this novel. It seems to cater to the needs of some low-level readers at present, and is a bit kitsch. Want to return. Because I didn't finish reading it directly. 
1	High performance-price ratio, the configuration of other brands at the same price is not so high (except for some), the appearance is good, the workmanship is better 
1	"I never thought that a man could write such tender things, very delicate emotions and very considerate brushstrokes, which can really make you feel a kind of long-lost warmth. I don’t know how many people can experience this ""pain"" sexually. Learning to endure has never experienced a lot of ups and downs in a lifetime. In contrast, the protagonist has experienced a lot and psychologically has a lot of beds. Who knows, is it not a kind of wealth? A good book. As a child, if your parents feel tired in life, you may suggest him or her to read this book ""nights in rodanthe"" "
1	The location is very convenient, just by the side of Zhongshan Square, there are buses to the scenic area, and it costs more than ten yuan to take a taxi. We are on the 11th floor and we can see the beautiful night view of Zhongshan Square by the window. It's just that the facilities in the room are older and you can't access the Internet 
1	The last chapter is dedicated to the interpretation of children’s meridians, which is warm and practical. The one I bought before was given to relatives who have new babies, so I will keep another one by myself and continue learning :) P. S. : I saw many people reading in the car, after all, bumps, let's avoid it. I wish you all benefits. 
1	In the introduction, it was a graphics card with 256MB of video memory. When I came back, it was 512MB. I don't know if I made a profit or sent it wrong. In short, I was secretly happy. It looks good. The 320G hard drive is very useful. 3D games are still alive, so I didn’t expect much. 
0	The room is acceptable at this price and the bathroom is huge! But the soundproofing is very poor and you can hear everything. The worst is the breakfast, which is simply horrible. All the tableware is made of plastic. The white plastic tableware has turned black because it has been used for a long time and has not been washed for a long time. Part of the plastic tableware is attached to some unknown unwashed objects, dripping with water (and even water in the bowl), I don’t know if it’s been washed or soaked in water and taken out, used to eat porridge. Flies flying in the sky, steamed buns and buns are cold. Dirty, dirty, too dirty! I can ask for a very simple breakfast or even white porridge with water, but I absolutely cannot tolerate dirty. The price says it includes breakfast, but it can be regarded as including breakfast. Anyway, I dare not eat it. Hotel Feedback May 21, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable comments to our hotel. In response to this situation, our company will propose a rectification plan. Our aim is to satisfy the guests, and we will continue to work hard for this. Thank you! Hope that next time you stay will give you a different feeling! ! 
1	The heat of the machine is small, much smaller than expected. The noise is well controlled, and there is basically no sound when running. The dual-core speed is good. The XP driver on the official website is also easier to install. 
0	It’s a bit thicker. The screen’s clarity is a bit worse than other brands. The mouse buttons on the fuselage don’t feel good. The 1024X600 display rate is still a bit smaller. If you use 1024X768 compressed display, the speed will be better. A lot slower. 
1	It’s always easy to be felt by a different kind of love. The ending of love is also perfect. I like this kind of love. I really don’t know what to say. I am very grateful for these excellent works that make me feel heartache and sweetness. Such unique love is difficult, I sometimes really dream that I can go back to a long time ago, I can love such a man, feel such a man’s heart and mind, feel such a man’s love, hatred, and hatred, and have such a love. Death cannot become a reality, so I am obsessed with ancient novels, unable to extricate myself, almost in love 
1	"Real people, real things, real feelings, people and things of the same time. To purify the soul, the public must have a sense of responsibility to purify the soul of society. Andy Lau is a Buddhist, and Yu Kexin is also a Buddhist. The Buddha's spirit saved the two of them from their personal sufferings. Brilliant words: Andy Lau realized: ""One thought of heaven, one thought of hell."" Yu Kexin realized: ""The heart is not obstructed, there is no obstruction, and there is no terror."" One point is precious. This is why I like this book. I have bookmarked this book. "
0	Japanese hotels are so poorly cooked. The room is very old, I knew it would be better to live in Jinjiang. The breakfast tastes bad, with few varieties. It's so unpalatable. The 528 yuan room I lived in. The price/performance ratio is totally out of the question. I will not choose here again. 
0	The Fn key is very uncomfortable on the very side, it is easy to confuse with the Ctrl key. The speaker is uncomfortable on both sides of the keyboard. It is not suitable for closing the screen to listen to music. The sound is also normal. Maybe the driver is not compatible with XP. Install the driver at random. I found it on the CD, but the wireless network card seems not to work. It’s OK to install the driver 
0	"Some words are remote and impractical. They are not focused, and the introduction says that after reading the book, they will laugh and laugh. It is a bit of a boast. In fact, I feel hard ""humor"" or even talking to myself, I laugh at all when I am happy If I don’t get up, I feel that the author is somewhat naive and vulgar. Perhaps this is one of the characteristics of Korea. "
0	It’s troublesome to install the xp driver. I still have an unknown device that can’t be identified. I don’t know what’s going on, but it doesn’t affect the use. 
0	IBM's previous notebooks were very good, but now the appearance has changed too much, let alone the performance. I think one thing I can't accept is that the outer cover has become piano paint. If you accidentally draw a line, it will be a mark when you touch it. 
1	"I am a freshman, and my freshman life has been in a muddle-headed state until I read this book. It means far more to me than a book. ""Du Lala's Promotion"" allowed me to re-examine my life and plan my future. In the future, I hope I can be as invincible as Lala. Interpersonal skills, ingenious communication with superiors and subordinates, good use of learning opportunities, every good word, I want to say that Du Lala not only inspires the white-collar workers at work, she is bound to change my life. Thank you author really. "
1	I found this book accidentally from the Internet. I read the introduction and thought it was good, so I continued to read the whole story. The plot inside makes people feel sad, especially in the second half. Because I haven't read the story of teacher-student relationship before, I think the author wrote it well. But the only thing that felt bad was the ending. Just like a Hong Kong series, leave a suspense for you to use your imagination. In fact, this is the most annoying for readers. Therefore, I personally think that the anticlimactic ending is the failure of this book. In addition, I am a little surprised why the paper quality of Dangdang's books is a bit weird. Is it genuine? 
1	Environment and traffic are good, the room is OK, will come again next time 
1	Mr. Lin Yutang said that he wanted to introduce China to the world through this, and I want him to do it. Mr. Lin imitated the structure of the Dream of Red Mansions. I think this structure is like a river. If the Dream of Red Mansions is the magnificent river, Lao Lin’s Jinghua Smoky Cloud is a trickling stream. She flows quietly by herself. If you approach her, you can see the clear stream. You can also find colorful stones and those swimming fish at the bottom of the stream. If you stay away from her, she It still flows continuously, never changed because of whether anyone is paying attention. 
1	The room is very large, the facilities are very luxurious, the service is very good, the price of 668. In Beijing, the same room, it is estimated to be two to three times the price. It is recommended to book the room without breakfast in 668, 100 breakfast, it feels inconsistent . Two people live, double breakfast, 858, spend 190 more, but breakfast is really average. The service is very good, when I checked out, a lady helped me carry the box. I was really moved and gave a tip. 
1	The battery is good, and the battery life is relatively long; with the XP operating system, the function is enough for the netbook. 
1	The room is newly renovated. As a Marriott Gold member, I upgraded to free broadband and free breakfast, which is much better than Wuxi Courtyard. There are not many smiling faces at the front desk, but compared to before, it has improved a lot. Encourage . 
0	"But as far as the positioning of ""Hundred Lectures"" is for middle school students, the positioning of this book is still more appropriate, and middle school students are fine. "
0	It’s really depressing. Dangdang’s speed is really slow and crashes. It’s been half a month since it was shipped from December 10 to December 26. 
1	"Dudu was exactly 3 years old when I bought this set of books. Like ""Tom Lost"", Dudu really sympathizes with Tom, his eyes will be fixed on the screen, his face will change with the storyline, and after reading it, he will go to the supermarket to discipline more, stay away from me They would say: Little rabbit is lost, how pitiful, I want to follow my mother. ""Tom is a brother"" is also very interesting. Dudu will take care of the children later in the kindergarten after reading. The printing quality is very good, the colors are mild, and the plot of each story is not very complicated, and the child is not tired. Dangdang delivered the book very quickly, received within 3 days, very satisfied. "
1	The battery is strong, the appearance is beautiful, and the running speed is good. Perfect screen, no light and no damage. Plus it's very cheap here. When changing the XP system by yourself, if error17 is displayed during startup, please fix the MBR. 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
0	The hotel is under renovation and smells great. When I left the hotel, I remember clearly that I missed a string of Tibetan Dzi beads in the room. It took three hours to remember it. Then I called the hotel reception, but the waiter who cleaned up the room just said that I didn’t see it. Could it be Buddha? Appear, let the prayer beads fly by themselves? It is estimated that the waiter took it by himself, and I am embarrassed to hand it over. It is really a problem with the character of the waiter! That is a string of very commemorative prayer beads, what a pity! Hotel feedback August 8, 2008: I am very sorry that this happened, and we are very surprised about the problem you have reported. The hotel management made a corresponding investigation in time, but according to the current situation, it cannot be confirmed that the attendant on duty took your prayer beads. But no matter what the result is, the hotel will take measures to strengthen the professional ethics of employees, and try to prevent such things from happening again! The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, which are decorated according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
0	It took a lot of setbacks to change the system, and finally the whole is intact! Disadvantages? It happens that the wrist rest part has a lot of heat, which affects the mood a little! 
0	Everyone says that this book contains a lot of psychological cases, but what kind of cases do I think? Isn't it a story compiled by the author, and it lacks analysis. What is a supplementary reading of psychology, I think it is just to string together some stories, and then disrupt the order. It is recommended for those who like to read novels, but if you really want to learn something about psychology, then forget it. 
0	"I bought it because I watched the ""Soldiers Assault"" series and loved it. Films and movies that I think can move me are more worthy of my own collection. But it's disappointing! "
0	"I’ve stayed here before and I feel pretty good, but this time it was terrible and I won’t live here anymore. 1. In the hotel I arrived after dark, the corridor was dark after getting out of the elevator, so I couldn't see clearly; 2. I ordered the ""luxury digital room"", but I couldn't find the network cable after I went in, and then called the room service and was told I need a cat, so I went to find it. I waited for about one and a half hours before bringing it in... The next day, I was borrowed by the waiter for another half an hour; 3. When the settlement was made, the floor attendant insisted that I had consumed two ""Heqizheng"", and it was worn out. It took nearly ten minutes to figure it out, they didn't even know how many of their rooms were equipped! 4. The evening meal is in the room. Because of the cash used for the deposit at the front desk, the cash on the body is not enough to pay for the meal. So I negotiated with the waiter to deduct the deposit from the room, or pay the deposit after I went out the next morning, but was refused, so I went out to withdraw cash. The location of this hotel is not good, there is no CCB, and it costs ten yuan to take a taxi back and forth... General comment: The rooms are average, the service is poor, and the service staff is poor! "
0	The microphone and the speaker resonate, there is a sharp noise after closing the lid, and the software adjustment is invalid, which is a design flaw. The color of the LED screen is common: reddish, the corners are treated in general, and the top cover is slightly weaker 
0	My classmate Xiaobao especially loves the Carmela series of stories. They have to tell them before going to bed every night. Those cute stories will accompany him to sleep...I myself also like the different Carmela, because it contains The picture is very interesting, talking pictures, I think it is like this, now my son can tell by himself (I want to see the sea), and I hope that after a while, I can be a listener. Dick Camelido, Carmen Berio Corbe, a little six son, a little thorny head and a little fat man, is really fun, and I must recommend it to all children if you have the opportunity 
1	The appearance is okay, and the price-performance ratio is high. It is okay to buy such a configuration at this price, and the operation is relatively stable in all aspects. No problems were found 
1	At this price, it is a very cost-effective hotel. Of course the price is cheap, so you can't care too much about the service. Generally speaking, it is a hotel willing to stay again. 
0	I don't know why everyone pays so much attention to this book, and the evaluation is also quite high. At that time, I followed the trend to read this book. After I bought it, I really read it page by page in the car, but the more I saw it, the more I felt that the book was dross. The general content of the book is too idealistic, too coincidental, and the detailed description is not bad, but the interest is greater than the educational significance. At most, it can only be regarded as a book that has nothing to do with you. no way. 
1	The performance is superior, and the high configuration at this price can be called high cost performance. The appearance is also very beautiful, and the hand does not feel too heavy. Running VISTA is very smooth. I don’t feel stuck when opening multiple programs. High memory is good. 
1	This controversy has been around for several years. In which year the Ming Dynasty died, and when should the Qing Dynasty be counted, whether it started with Nuerhachi proclaiming the emperor, or when Huang Taiji changed its title to Qing, or when Since the beginning of Shunzhi’s entry into Beijing, it has been a difficult topic to this day. The Ming Dynasty is the same. Chongzhen would have died since the Hanging Coal Mountain and the Ming Dynasty. The capital has fallen. But the Qing Dynasty did not unify the country at that time. There is still Nanming in the South. Of course, today It’s not to argue and study this topic, but feel that in order to enrich everyone’s knowledge and common sense of Ming Dynasty history, the author should continue to write about Nan Ming. After all, Nan Ming is also Ming. 
0	The disadvantage is that there is no supporting CD, so you need to back it up. I don't like this kind of touchpad very much. I didn't send a mouse, but I had to match it myself. This is a small problem. The button of the wireless network card slot is too protruding, I'm afraid it will be broken accidentally. But don't use it so brutally, there will be no big problem. 
1	The location of the hotel is good, the transportation is very convenient, the overall room feels okay, but the bathroom is a bit small. The breakfast provided by the hotel is not rich enough. The overall service consciousness of the hotel staff is good, especially the lobby manager, who specially sent us a local map when arranging the car reservation, which was very careful and thoughtful. 
0	If you can, try not to live as much as possible. It's only a word. Anyway, I will change place after I live for a day 
1	"I am a manga fan myself! I really like Zhu Deyong's work! I bought the book ""Absolute Child"" immediately after it was published. The content inside is so funny! My daughter also likes it very much, and she rushes to do homework every day when she comes back, and then read the book well. Haha! This is my little plan! If you finish your homework earlier, you can watch this comic book as a reward! ""Absolute Kid 2"" was bought as a reward of 95 points or more in the final exam. It's really good to use this book as a material stimulus! "
1	"When I just bought it, I found that the book was written ""End"". I thought it was the last one, but I knew it was not. Fortunately, I bought the sixth book. If not, I don’t know the result. Knowing the true face of Ling Rong in this book is really shocking. How could she treat her like this to her sister. How could she forget how his father was saved by Zhen Huan? Right is what everyone wants, especially in places like the harem, without the emperor's gift, right and status are the greatest, and it is this kind of thing that can protect oneself. The harem is really scary. "
1	The hotel is located in the central area of Kunming, the location is good, but the hotel service is a bit poor, there may not be many guests staying in the first night, the air conditioner is not turned on at all, I called and asked, saying that the central air conditioner should be turned on at night, but it was not at night It was hot for the whole night. The next day there was a meeting for check-in, and the air-conditioning was available in the evening. I have to say that the hotel’s budget is good. The bed in the room is too hard and sleeps well. The breakfast in the hotel is just like other people. The evaluation is the same, the idea is unpalatable. But the booking price of Ctrip is not bad. 
0	It’s not fun to feel like buying it is a waste 
1	The room is a bit small, the superior room is 398 yuan, very clean, in Beijing, it is cost-effective, but there is no breakfast. There are few places to eat around. The single room is very small, the single bed is placed against the wall, and is generally 450mm wide. Towels and bath towels look very clean. 
0	It's a bit heavy, it has nothing to do with Jingdong, hehe, after all, it only costs 3999 yuan, the price is lower than the market! 
0	I booked a standard room for ￥228. I waited for ten minutes at the front desk to open the room. I was told that I had opened the wrong room as soon as I entered the room. It was said that it was opened for ￥228 (in fact, it was two more bottles of water than the ￥228. , Two small bags of biscuits), and then I was rushed out of the room by the waiter (yes, yes), and asked about the newly opened room. The waiter looked unhappy and said that it was delivered at the waiting meeting, and it took another ten minutes. The waiter took the room card again. The room facilities felt average, not up to the standard of Samsung. It was not as good as some business hotels where I lived in Guanyinqiao, and the price could be cheaper. 
0	The content is thin and meaningless. It is helpful for people with no literacy level, but if you are a person with a certain degree of expertise, it is not interesting. Empty and boring, it doesn't take a long time to read the whole book. 
1	Although the article is full of attacks on others; although it seems to be arrogant and unreasonable; although sometimes it is full of nonsense to vent your anger; I still think this is a good book. In this age of material desire, to be able to understand this era so soberly and to put forward very unique insights is a must for a transforming China. Overly radical expressions are only to alert the world. China should have such different views, a state of contention among a hundred schools of thought, and a blindly unified argument will only make people more dull. Several articles cited in the book are also very profound. This book is worth reading for young people! 
0	Very poor and poor service. The room is relatively large, but also very poor, and more importantly, it is close to the railway, very noisy! No wonder the hotel business is not good and there are few people! 
1	"It is close to the Chuansha Highway, but the bus directions are wrong. If it is the ""Cailu Line"", it will be very troublesome. It is recommended to use another route. The room is relatively simple. "
0	It's not that the content is bad, but the quality of the book. Will Dangdang have pirated books? 146 went straight to 179 and 30 pages were missing. Both returns and exchanges take one month. Crazy dizzy. . Dangdang can't keep the quality of the customers? In addition, make the return and exchange faster and more convenient for consumers? There will be a shadow of buying books in Dangdang in the future. 
0	It is the Overlord Clause. The 200 yuan Dong coupon given can only be used after spending another 5,000 yuan. It feels like a quilt. 
0	The hotel does not reach the five-star standard. High price, poor environment, average service 
1	Older, but overall it feels okay. The service is also ok. 
1	The basic performance of the netbook is like this, and it is good for people who are only used to chat online and do some simple office work. In terms of balanced configuration, workmanship, etc., this is very suitable for men who are generally just trading stocks and chatting online. It looks more stable, not as big as A4 paper. The price/performance ratio is outstanding. 
1	Purchased at 4399 yuan, Lenovo's after-sales service is relatively complete, and after so many years of notebooks, the quality should be guaranteed! 
0	The battery seems to be longer. The Lenovo logo printed on it feels a bit silly. I still like the Vista installation with ibm only. It’s really uncomfortable. The first boot took 5 to 6 minutes, and the second memory plugged in was a little better. Don't know how to install xp in 
1	"This book is immediately followed by ""Spring and Autumn Days"". The author has consistently used simple language to tell us how the ancient intellectual heroes interpreted the Spring and Autumn Period, and how these interpretations reached the temples and became the starting point and basis for the great policies of the past. There is only one Spring and Autumn, but there are countless interpretations. It is the profound or biased or gorgeous interpretations of the first-class elites in the past, which weaves a beautiful and infinitely changing ideological landscape. The author led us to tour this picture in an orderly manner, pointing out the subtleties and subtleties one by one, allowing us to have a better understanding of history. Seriously recommended! "
1	Let’s try the world, all beings are in sight, the protagonist of everything, the sculpture is so real and emotional; and every plot of the story is rendered so sincere and moving, there is no gorgeous rhetoric, only the prosaic and cheerful writing like flowing water, look There are too many fake and exquisite articles, but I feel that such works are the most precious works. I admire this book very much, turning page by page, it's like turning over the history of this generation, turning over their stories, turning it over to the pure touch and simplicity in the corner of my heart. I like Ang's attitude in writing, and I also like the thoughts this book gives me. It is very meaningful. 
0	It's too small, I'm not used to it when I'm used to a desktop and switch to a small one. Heavier than expected. It didn't take 9.5 hours, maybe 6 hours. I didn’t bring my own office, so I installed it myself, so I was reminded to use the genuine one every day...a bit annoying... 
1	Beibei Xiong 1-30 My daughter and I like it very much, and I also indirectly educate my children through them. I didn’t like to buy smaller books for my children, but these 50 books made me feel its wonderfulness. Sometimes the preaching of parents is really empty. The image in the book and the cute image make the daughter like it at once, accept it, perceive it, and then I will guide it in a timely and appropriate manner. It is very effective, and it is very effective for the current Children, they can become her playmates. This subtle influence is really remarkable and worth collecting. It can be said that the second series is as exciting as the first series! ! ! 
1	The first volume is really a bit angry. I really appreciate the newly published short story, but it adds the same content as the previously bought short story collection. The author explains it later, but it is really a waste of money. feel. But you can't buy them separately, you need to buy the whole set, hey, endless sigh. I have no problem with the second book. The second book is what I really want, but I still have to buy the whole set. Hey. . . . . . . . . . . . . 
1	"""Wadi's Trumpet"" is very similar to a video narrative, with a sense of picture, and its actions are delicate like pores under a microscope, pulsating vivid breathing. The love of civilians under racial conflicts and social chaos seems to be light and windy, but it can most give birth to sorrowful emotions, just like the story of ""The Common People Millionaire""-under the most ethereal love cloud is the anxious land, and this Life on this land is beautiful and cruel. To borrow a sentence imprinted in people's minds in ""Wadi's Trumpet"": It is not you who is stupid, but the situation... a trace of helplessness, a touch of profoundness. "
1	Very satisfied hotel with good decoration. The internet in the room that night had a problem, the person in charge of the internet got off work again, and the waiter enthusiastically took me to the business center downstairs to surf the Internet for free. The drop-off service is also very good. In short, I am very satisfied. I will live in Kunming in the future! 
1	The staff is good, the location is excellent, and the breakfast is good. However, the internal facilities of the hotel rooms are relatively outdated and the house area is also small. Compared with the newly-built economy hotels, it has little advantage and does not reflect the four-star standard. Currently, the surrounding area is undergoing demolition and construction, and there is construction at night downstairs. Fortunately, I did not hear the construction sound inside the house. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is average. 
1	Checked in on June 30. The room is generally ok, but a bit old. The surrounding environment is better. In terms of service, the doorman was very diligent in helping to open the door, but unfortunately he didn't know to help with the luggage. Special praise for breakfast is better. In general, it feels like 3 stars+, but not 4 stars 
0	The first time I bought Lala’s promotion note, it arrived in three days (I live on the edge of Beijing Third Ring Road), and I am quite satisfied. Second, I bought the book <Ming Dynasty>, which was ordered on June 22. I didn’t receive it in a week. I called customer service. I always answered that I’m sorry. I haven’t received it in two weeks. I received it when I was about to stand up. Dangdang’s text message said that the order could not be found and asked me to reorder. Is there such a shameless service in the world? When I reordered, I found that the discount on the book was 10% less, which means the price increased. Call the customer service again, and the customer service saw that my order date was more than half a month ago, and agreed to apply for a gift certificate before re-ordering, and promised that the gift certificate would arrive in the account in the afternoon. I waited and waited, and waited for another day and a half, but still didn't have any gift certificates. But today, that is, July 10th, the book I ordered finally came to me at a speed beyond thinking. Dare to ask Dangdang, is this your consistent style? How do you plan to compensate for the loss of physical discomfort caused by the angry bad emotions that have caused me? 
1	The performance is very good, Call of Duty 4, 5, Prince of Persia 4, Need for Speed 12 has the highest effect, 2 times anti-aliasing can run smoothly 
1	1. Jingdong’s service is good. The customer service reminded me that the attitude of checking the products is pretty good. 2. The price is OK, better than the ones in Guangzhou stores, and 3 and 2G with tickets are enough. 4. Install OEM HP XP The system is successful! Ka Ka, convenient, I made it myself 
1	I have stayed in this hotel before, but it was still managed by HILTON at that time. Now it is NIKKO. It feels obviously not as good as before, and the facilities are somewhat outdated. However, in a five-star hotel in Dalian, the price of this hotel is relatively relatively Reasonable, there is a newly built fashionable living area near the hotel, there are some good restaurants and coffee shops, and the hotel's comprehensive services and management need to be strengthened. 
1	I bought a new birthday gift for my girlfriend. This time, Jingdong delivered it very quickly. It was scheduled on Thursday afternoon and delivered on Friday. The speed of the machine is good, the metal feels very good, and it is much more beautiful than the ones seen on the Internet. The screen looks very comfortable, especially the small details such as the switch indicator light are very attractive to girls. 
0	After seeing a hundred forums, I became interested. Because I was busy with work, I only read a little bit, so I bought a book to make up. But I fell asleep after watching. It's better to buy discs, lively. 
0	"I sent eight books, and the others were all good, all covered in plastic covers. This one, ""Alive"", not only had no coat, but was crumpled and ravaged, which affected the mood of reading too much. "
0	"Although the author spent a lot of space, I was a little disappointed after reading it and felt that the money was spent in vain. In fact, most of the book is personal lyric, self-pity and self-love of little women. Cute is cute, but in terms of practicality, I think it's not as good as ""Seeking a doctor is worse than asking yourself"". In fact, the book ""31 Years Old"", one of the few essence thoughts, comes from this book ""Seeking Doctor"". The rich content, the rigorous logic, the fluent and interesting writing, the profound knowledge and the objective explanation of ""Seeking Doctor"" are beyond the reach of this book. If you have ""Seeking Doctor"", you don't need to buy this book. "
1	The appearance looks more beautiful than the picture, the configuration is good, the price is higher, and there is no unpacking. I checked it is a brand-new machine without an operating system 
0	I booked this hotel on behalf of my colleagues. I heard that this hotel is good, but I didn't expect to call the hotel several times to consult about things. The attitude of the front desk staff was very impatient and very poor. As a hotel, the front desk is a pivotal department, and I am very disappointed to have such a service. 
1	I think the books are still good, but I didn't expect to buy Compaq. Although it is HP now, I am still a little disappointed. 
1	The room is OK, but the hardware facilities are deviated and the service level is average. 
1	The conditions, services and facilities are very good. The rooms are clean and comfortable, especially the front desk service is very good. The room is large, the bed is wide, the heating is adequate, and the hot water is also large. Will live next time! 
0	Very poor hotel, not as good as a chain economy hotel, if it weren't for Xiangfan, there is no other hotel close to Dongfeng, I would definitely not choose it again. poor! ! 
0	It's just a guest house, the only good point is that the traffic is okay, on the side of the third ring road. 
1	The advantages are basically the same as everyone said. The look is better; the keyboard is very comfortable; the heat dissipation is also good, and the left palm rest can feel a little warm at room temperature 26, which is acceptable. The price is okay. 
0	"I bought the first six volumes of ""Different Carmela"" for my son, and read with him in the bed every night before going to bed. We both liked it. I like the playful pictures in the book and the author's rich imagination. Later, as soon as the seventh book ""I Want to Find Lang Lang"" was released, I hurriedly bought it and shared it with my son. We are eagerly looking forward to the eighth, ninth and tenth volumes of ""A Different Carmela""... Because we like the various and imaginative stories that Carmela, Piccolo, Carmelo and Carmen bring to us. "
1	"The first thing I felt when I saw this book was: I hate seeing you late! I used to think that I could see everything, knew everything, and didn't care about anything. But in the process of reading this book, I feel that I really don't understand anything, especially in terms of being a person. When Professor Qian explained Xuan Zang in the forum of Hundred Schools in the past, I felt that he was very kind, especially some of the truths were very easy to understand. This time explaining the ""Three Character Classic"" is a rare learning opportunity. Although I haven't finished reading this book, I have been deeply attracted. I hope everyone can learn from it. "
0	System installation is troublesome, for novices. The notebook is a bit thick, buy it for girls to pay attention to the appearance. Not suitable for girls 
0	The hotel's price-performance ratio is extremely low, the breakfast variety is monotonous, foreigners usually only eat breakfast, but this time they have to eat lunch; the room is very small when staying in the deluxe floor, and it is difficult to turn around. The two beds are only 15cm away; the toilet is not water; It took a long time to open; the general feeling is that the garden is small and the room decoration is rough. I thought Hyde's products must be good, because I have stayed at the 398 yuan Yiwu Hyde Hotel, and this one in Yangzhou is a rude. Also. Receive more than 600 one night hotel feedback July 14, 2008: I am very sorry for the trouble caused to you due to the imperfections of our work, we have specially convened department coordination to investigate your questions. I very much hope that you can contact our marketing department to express our apologies for presenting our gifts. Thank you for your valuable comments. 
1	It's very good in the sand area. Because I work in the sand area, I had to choose this one. 
1	It is worth staying at the oldest hotel in Foshan for a price of more than 300. At least it serves as a memory of history. It is the first hotel in Guangdong that has a domestic revolving restaurant on the roof. Recommend this hotel to eat authentic, very local characteristics of Foshan, whether it is the Chinese food on the second floor or the revolving restaurant on the roof, you can use morning tea, lunch, and dinner. The price is civilian, unlike some that take a revolving, you must come for a set meal. If it is the first time to come to Foshan, I recommend staying here. Hotel service facilities are inevitably aging, but it's passable. The room is more than 10 square meters, not big; Cara Nina is nearby. I heard that the room there is even smaller; the nearby place to visit is Baihua Plaza (Commercial Plaza), Ancestral Temple 
1	The product is good and cost-effective, but the graphics card has some bottlenecks. Stable operation, original unopened. 
1	The configuration is OK and the price is good. The stability is good and the heat dissipation is also very good. Although the design is different from the T series, it is not bad. 
0	I placed an order with two other books, but this one was omitted without any explanation, and the invoice was only paid for two books. 
0	As Sofitel Galaxy, who lives in Nanjing, feels good, so this time I came to Chengdu and retired from Sheraton to Sofitel Wanda. The master and baggage staff who picked up the plane were very good, but what happened next made me feel very angry. I asked the front desk for two room cards, one of which couldn’t open the door, and then went to the lobby to change one and went out to eat, but when I came back, I found that the room card could not be opened at the front desk. I waited in the corridor for ten minutes. The bellman took a new room card, entered the room and found that the turndown was not open, and then called the center of the house to open the bed. The most annoying thing was that my room could hear the sound of the elevator machines as much as possible, so I couldn't sleep. Finally, I called the chief mate to change rooms, and at three o'clock in the middle of the night, he was changing rooms with large bags and small bags. This was the first time that happened in a five-star hotel since then! ! ! Hotel feedback March 25, 2008: Hotel response: Thank you very much for your visit and your attention to our Sofitel brand. We apologize for the discomfort you encountered in the hotel, and sincerely thank you for the insufficiency of our hotel services and facilities. We will strengthen the training and supervision of the front desk staff to improve the quality of service and build the brand. better. And sincerely hope that you will have the opportunity to come to the hotel again to experience our improvements in all aspects. 
0	My son is 4 and a half years old. I got this book and I read it with him. I felt that the picture was too messy. The child didn't know where to look, and it would be very tired to read a few pages, but the storyline was naive, a little younger. Maybe you will be interested! But I don’t know why this book is written for a wider age group. In short, when I bought this book, I felt that the price was not low. I hesitated. Later, the website always recommended it and decided to buy it, but I was disappointed after reading it! There is no publicity! This book has one advantage: if it is a drawing book, it would be good. There are different car, airplane and animal shapes in the book, which is very beautiful! 
0	Ctrip members please note: There is noise and dust due to construction such as subways next to this hotel. There is still a period of time until completion. It is not convenient to call a taxi when you go out. Please consider these factors when you check in. Tea in the room is not free Yes, it is necessary to collect money, but also pay attention. 
0	I lived on the fifth day of the year, and there was no heating or hot water on such a cold day. The front desk of Ctrip's reservation said it did not receive it. In short, I feel very amateurish. 
1	The keyboard works well, bigger than expected, but still a bit smaller. The screen is ok, and the battery life is very long, meeting expectations. Install the genuine windows XP system directly without any problems. 
0	The disadvantage is that the hard disk makes a sound when starting up, there are few sockets, no Bluetooth function, no camera, and the price drop is too fast. I also send anti-virus software. 
1	Dell business jets are well made, and the design is much better than previous business jets. The price is cheap, which is good. 
0	If this kind of hotel is also a 3-star hotel, I really have nothing to say. Uncomfortable from the beginning of the check-in: Because I have not booked a 4-star hotel, Ctrip recommends staying here. It is a 3-star hotel, which is ok. Arrived after 12 o'clock in the evening, when you check in, the waiter does not ask you whether to swipe your card or pay cash after registration. He tells you directly, if you pay 500 deposit, I said I will only pay 200 yuan in cash. After the check in is over, the waiter is no longer visible, so look for the elevator yourself. The elevator is a mini-type, so if you can stand up to 4 people, you can't move. The room has an unpleasant smell, which makes you sick. I don’t know how long I haven’t wiped it on the table. I touched it with my hand. It was dark. I wiped the toilet paper several times. The bathroom door is broken, the door frame is full of big holes, like shells exploded, the room has no heating, I wake up in the middle of the night, I can’t find the quilt to add, so I have to press the clothes on my body to feel my body It's not cold anymore. Breakfast plus side dishes, no more than 10 kinds, don’t know what to eat, no fruit, just eat a bowl of porridge. When checking out, the waiter called on the floor to make a round of the room. After 1 minute, the waiter told me fiercely, did you take the yellow pages and you want to compensate. gosh! ! ! What yellow pages? After asking for a long time, he said that a book in the drawer was missing. Damn, such a dirty table, I didn't even touch the drawers, and I didn't even dare to use towels in the bathroom. What are you doing with your broken book? Did you put it out, or you put it somewhere else, find it yourself. MD, what a broken place. Tossing for a long time, still won't let me go. In the end, I don’t know if they found it or not, or they found that they didn’t put any yellow pages at all, no one explained to me, and no one apologized to me, but they could finally let me go, not yet Take the initiative to give me an invoice. After requesting to print, gave me a receipt. Fortunately, the rooms in the 4-star Jingdezhen Hotel have come out and you can move in. Quickly leave this place of right and wrong. After thinking about it, the front desk called up, and then called upstairs in about 1 minute and said that the book was missing. At such a fast speed, it seemed that I had already known what was missing, and people couldn't help but doubt its purpose. 
0	The location of the hotel is relatively remote, the traffic is very inconvenient, and the hotel does not have an elevator, so it is not suitable for traveling with luggage, nor for people with limited mobility. 
1	The standby time is long, the screen is adjusted to the darkest, the standby time can be up to 9 hours. I bought it for my wife. It is suitable for girls to use white notebooks. White is indeed better than black, and the chocolate keyboard is also good. The power adapter is small enough. 
1	It’s okay. The things in the restaurant downstairs are not expensive at all. 
0	I like AMD's chips, which are cost-effective. This kind of heat dissipation is good. Like AMD's chips, the price is good. This heat dissipation is good 
0	I forgot to read it when I bought it. I went back and found that there was no mouse. There should be some. There was a problem with the XP installation. It’s still being reinstalled. 
1	Overall, I was very satisfied, but there was a little improvement. I checked in on the 9th floor, and when I went to the front desk on the 1st floor, the waiter on the 9th floor checked the room and found that I had some odd items missing in the room. I asked them to send it down. The answer was yes I went to the room service department on the 4th floor to get it. When I got to the 4th floor, I convinced the staff that they didn't have time to get it again. Of course this is nothing, but if they bring things down, even if they get them on the 4th floor, I will have a better impression of the hotel. 
0	I am very dissatisfied with this hotel for three reasons. First: Refusing to issue invoices at checkout. The waiter said that they must pay four yuan to issue invoices. ! They had nothing to say, but in the end they received one yuan from us before issuing the invoice, because they were catching the train, otherwise they must be held accountable! ! Second: The hotel has no stairs, so you have to go up by yourself, very tired, and the hotel said it is a three-star, ask them what license? Answer: Not posted yet. Third: The drinking fountain in room 418 is very dirty. We removed the bucket and washed it for a long time. It was all gray! 
0	The author doesn't understand the fart himself, and writes something terribly false to deceive everyone's attention. Alas, it damages the image of Chinese medicine. I suggest you not to buy it. I feel quite fooled after buying it. 
0	The heat dissipation is not good and it is too heavy. When the notebook is put in a vertical bag, there will be a big opening on the upper and lower sides. It is better to have a card when the display and keyboard are combined. Also, is this model without remote control? 
0	Because everyone's comments are good, so I bought it. But...what? It's almost...very...how to put it...helpless...not as good as I thought... 
1	The appearance inherits the style of IBM and the configuration is not low. The best choice under 4000. The screen is big enough to watch movies. 
1	Reading this book reminds me of our fleeting years. At that time, each of us was so young, with hope and ideals, thinking that we could see fireworks all over the sky when we ran over, but we didn't know that the fireworks only opened for a moment and disappeared in a blink of an eye. We have all spent time on these things that are easy to pass away, delivered a lot, and sacrificed a lot. When I grow up I know that nothing is more precious than love. It's a pity that Love refused to come back. Fortunately, Xiaoli can still find a part. Although he has an unrecoverable pain in his life, he is not very sad at all. Bless Xiaoli. 
0	The photo is fake, a family guest house, a hotel where the trash comes home. The most trash place I have ever stayed in 
1	This is Sen’s landmark work after he won the Nobel Prize in Economics. The book systematically expounds such a view of development from the aspects of economy, politics, society, and values: Freedom is the primary purpose of development, and it is also the imperative to promote development. The lack of means. It is a pity that what this book actually lacks in the development view of our country is what this book describes; it is also difficult to have such a masterpiece in China. First, there is a lack of scholars with such a development view, and it is difficult to publish it even if there are. 
1	"Read this book twice in succession. For those cases that are just like happening around you, for those parents who are easy to go astray, for the beloved children-I hope I can absorb the essence of the book as much as possible into the words and deeds of life, and truly become accompanying children A happy and healthy fellow traveler. ""Dao Zhi Jian"", this concise and practical psychology book can be widely used in dealing with many relationships, because as long as you read carefully and you are willing to practice, you can master those efficient methods. She is indeed a rare good book. "
0	The built-in system is not used to it, and it takes 1 hour to get it. As a result, it is not easy to install the win7 system. After a day of tossing, I finally installed win7, using the mobile hard disk installation method. 
0	The keyboard design is not reasonable, the ctrl key is too far and the shift key is too short; the keys feel hard. The bare metal + battery is nearly 5 kg, which is heavy. 
0	The article is similar to a colloquial narrative, and the examples cited are too short and unconvincing, as if they were fabricating facts to prove their views. 
1	"I also played the game some time ago. . . The real history is often mixed with some dark elements, such as the plundering of new land by the slave trade, but for people today, the sea is still a desirable world, so fill the past history into memory and continue to flourish. The movie I just watched the day before yesterday, ""The English Pirates"", the book actually wrote that there was Edward Titch in history, but in the movie he was the captain of the British Blackbeard Pirates and historically he was on the Caribbean side. . . "
0	Just a few pages are about sex and caution, or the last few pages. I don’t like it. There is no head or tail. It doesn’t make sense to look at it. After buying it, I feel very bad. It feels like I was fooled. It’s so good, you get what you pay for. In order to make more money, I also wrote novels that are not the title of the book and published them together. I feel that the grade has dropped a lot, and I won’t buy it again next time. 
0	"I stayed in November for two days, and I felt cheated when I walked in. There is a dirt road several hundred meters into the hotel. It is a very ordinary decoration. There is no advantage in price. It’s not Golden Week that I can’t get a refund and I will leave immediately. There is no parking lot here. You have to pay for parking next door. One day there was a Guangzhou car parked on the side of the road for the night to scold the boss half to death. We took a few children to play, a little bit naughty. The child scolded the boss's mother very harshly. OMG! I spend more than 500 nights staying here and I still feel so angry. Ha ha! It's really like his advertisement: it feels like going home. ""Because I always talk to my mother when I go home"" "
1	Checked in on June 30. The room is generally ok, but a bit old. The surrounding environment is better. In terms of service, the doorman was very diligent in helping to open the door, but unfortunately he didn't know to help with the luggage. Special praise for breakfast is better. In general, it feels like 3 stars+, but not 4 stars 
0	Generally speaking, I am very dissatisfied. It is obviously a three-star hotel upgraded to a four-star. The price of 588 is really worthless. The heating is not hot enough, the temperature is adjusted to 32 degrees, and two quilts are required to sleep at night. Ask them to ask for another bed. My answer is that each room is equipped with these, and there are no extra quilts. The bath water was warm and almost didn't wash out a cold. I asked for an iron and ironing board. There was only one set in the entire hotel, so I couldn't borrow it. Moreover, the facilities are very old, and the towels and quilts used are all old, which can be seen at a glance. It is not a four-star standard. I hope everyone will not book this hotel in the future. 
0	The memory is a bit small. Although I bought one and installed it, it’s better to send the root memory through a direct promotion on JD. It’s more user-friendly, and there is no bag to send it to the computer, and it is not very user-friendly. It is general to purchase a batch My computer bag is only 20-30 yuan, which is a bit stingy for JD! 
0	There are no other color options. The YTO delivery service is really ordinary, only delivered downstairs. In the past, Jingdong used postal express to deliver it to the door. 
1	The secret of helium in the workplace will never be out of date. Every professional can use it to support himself! 
0	1. Fingerprint collector. 2. The response speed of the touchpad is slightly lower than that of the single-touch model. 3. The keyboard feel needs time to adapt. 
0	When shopping, they are still in stock. In the end, it informed me that it was out of stock. Dangdang's service attitude really needs to be improved. 
1	"The online version of this book gave me a greater shock, because it is difficult to imagine a taboo feeling that can make a reader look forward to, understand and bless you so naturally and sincerely, but it did. When I ordered the book, I thought that out of harmony, certain details and the positioning of the ""relationship"" would definitely change, as expected. But because I really liked the book, I bought a physical book. Although it is slightly different from the online version, it is still a good book, but in some ways, its shock may be reduced, but it is more than the physical book. "
1	The rooms are quite small, but almost all hotels in Hong Kong are like that. The front desk service is very good and the location of the hotel is also very good. Surrounded by residential areas, very quiet. 
0	The car-based drawing format is not suitable for parent-child reading by Chinese girls. My child will be fresh for a while and never want to watch it again! 
0	I hate VISTA the most. I can’t connect to the broadband. It installed an office2007 for me and needs to be activated. It can only be used 24 times without activation. It only takes 60 days after activation. Oh my god, don’t be so stingy. 
1	Jia Pingwa made a major breakthrough in traditional prose writing-all his unique perceptions of society and life, personal emotions (love and hate), or some philosophies that he occasionally felt, are all presented in the text. That candid, unassuming, low-profile character is also one of his ways to win readers. In other articles, it is not difficult to find that Jia Pingwa's innocent heart is indeed hard to find in today's complex society. Moreover, Jia Pingwa's pursuit of beauty is clear and easy to see between the lines. He not only cares about self-appreciation, but also willing to introduce and practice this aesthetic path to readers. 
0	You can take Metro Line 8 and get off at Qufu Road. Exit at the intersection of North Tibet Road. You can find National Day Road on the opposite side. But the towels and bath towels in this hotel are quite old, and they are still yellow. I have never used them. Fortunately, just stayed for one day. In comparison, the Jinyuan Hotel on the opposite side does much better in this respect. The old one is a bit old but the towels are better, at least they can be used. But this place is relatively quiet. 
1	The quality is no problem. It has been more than ten days since I bought it, and there is nothing wrong with it. The genuine operating system, genuine anti-virus software, and genuine Office software. I plan to use Vista without changing the system, and it runs pretty well. 
1	I am very supportive. Don’t say anything else during the counting process. Silence in the middle of the 1\2\3 number interval will put more pressure on the child’s psychological behavior. However, sometimes, if it reaches 2, the child still If I didn’t calm down, I would say: “It’s already passed 2. After the implementation, I think I have to give him a process to adapt, so it is equivalent to counting to four sometimes... But absolutely not. The child talks about the price. 
1	When I first got this book, I didn't wait to open it. Because I want to find the right time to savor the beauty and sorrow. In the dead of night, the lights of Wanjia gradually went out. I was alone in the room, lighting the lamp, and found that he could quickly integrate into the plot described in the book. After every beautiful poem, there is a story of sadness or happiness. Lost with the protagonist’s grief, happy and happy, let me know that in ancient times, there could be such a heart-pounding love. An everlasting feeling. 
1	My baby is a girl. I bought this book when she was 2.5 years old, because I personally like this kind of natural science books. I searched for related types of books on the Internet. This set was well received, so I bought it. Before I bought it, I was worried that my child would not like it. I did not expect to go home and show it to the child after I got the book. She liked it very much. After reading it a few times, she remembered a lot of dinosaur names. Endlessly, at the same time, it also allowed me, a science fan, to deepen my understanding of relevant knowledge. It not only educates children but also enriches myself, it really kills two birds with one stone. 
0	The location of the hotel is a bit far from the train station, the room environment is very ordinary, and the environment is too messy at night, especially the checkout at the front desk is so slow I have never seen it before, made me wait for 40 minutes, and I will never stay here 
0	The surrounding environment of the hotel is poor, the interior is also very old, the sanitation is not good, it is very dirty, nothing good, I will never stay here next time. 
1	Very good, service and room facilities are very good. I went with my girlfriend on the Dragon Boat Festival. My girlfriend's mobile phone was out of power. I asked the main station to borrow a universal charger. It was delivered soon. The food there is also very good, delicious, ha ha. Overall good 
1	Lightweight, non-defective, stable. Genuine V system, 7000 to buy a genuine, what else is there to say. Buying this on Jingdong Mall is really reassuring. The speed is also very fast. 
0	I opened the package and found that there was a white dotted line on the outer edge of the optical drive, which seemed to be rubbed white paint, which was not completely wiped off after a long time. Depressed! The sound effect is poor. 
1	I have no words to describe this book. I saw this book from the QQ message of my mobile phone. At that time, it was okay to simply look at the content. Occasionally I saw this book when I came to Dangdang when I was online. Bought the first book and went back to read it. This look is out of control. I have watched it more than ten times. Every time I look at it, I feel anguish. Also let many of my colleagues watch it. Now I have collected this book very cherished. Now I have bought the second sequel of this book. Hope it can touch my heart again. Four Eyes Puppy Network cherishes this book. Hope everyone will share 
1	I occasionally stayed in a special double room, which is the second time I have stayed in this store. I want to praise it, and there have been many improvements. I can see that the hotel is still operating with great care. There are free books in the special double room, Damn, there are 7\8 kinds, and I also put a pillow of tea in the tea garden. My girlfriend likes it very much, it smells good, and there are free discs and DVD rentals, as long as you deposit 200 oceans, there are many blockbusters to choose from The MM service at the main station is very enthusiastic and the people are beautiful. When I checked in, I asked where I could go shopping at night. I immediately introduced Donglin Plaza. The night view is really beautiful. The Carrefour supermarket and Poly Plaza next to it can be SHOPPING to help my girlfriend. I got a skirt, and by the way, I had some supper, hey, this night is good. 
1	Although I just started to read, it has already brought me a lot of thought shock. While reading and practicing, I suddenly found that the communication with my son became smoother! ! After reading this book, I realized that sometimes I am a kind of forced love, strangling love, and depriving love for children! It turns out that they have their own thinking in their little world! ! There are many skills to help, educate and care for children! ! Of course, respect comes first. This is a very good set of books, but there are many research vocabulary in the book, you need to read more to understand it! ! Not finished, humble opinion! Enjoy reading

1	"After reading ""Lala"", I have a preliminary understanding of the hardships of the workplace. Although he is still a college student who hasn't walked out of campus, he is within easy reach of going out of campus. Suddenly ""Lala"" made me soberly aware that the opportunities and challenges that large companies have are justified by non-Fortune 500 companies. The dream seems to be higher and farther, and at the same time, confused. Suddenly, all the original ideas were subverted, and a kind of thinking that wanted to live a ""la-la"" life was established. Is it reality or illusion? There is no answer. I can only change to chewing ""Lala"", while living in my own life, looking for answers. "
0	The quality of the book is really rough, which makes people appetite. I turned the table of contents and looked at some of the content. It is really not flattering. It is a courseware handout without any vividness. In short, it is not as good as the introduction. , I have almost no interest in opening this book again~ 
0	It uses a traditional SATA notebook hard drive, the model starts with ST, which should be Seagate, so the weight is slightly increased, and it is a little heavier in the backpack, but it is reasonable. 
0	Everyone knows the benefits of reading aloud to children. The key is how to read and what to read. The examples in the book are all foreign, and there is no reading list for Chinese children. 
1	"After reading the book, I sat quietly for a long time, feeling very complicated, an unexplainable touch. At the same time, it also makes me introspect, everything I have done. It is difficult for me to tell the feelings, the investigation of human nature, the loyalty of human nature, and of course the cruelty of human nature. ""What reason do we have to blame others for the past?"" This kite is a false sign, it can be everything: love, hate, affection, sorrow, or it may be a deep redemption...whether it is What, for the hidden and buried deep in our hearts, we bravely chase after. "
1	I booked a day on Ctrip, and actually stayed for two days. The hotel charged a day’s room rate based on the Ctrip price and upgraded my business room for free. I asked the hotel’s front desk to borrow nail clippers, and they said no, suggesting that such small items should still be provided for the convenience of guests. I had a buffet breakfast, the variety is not bad, but there is no milk, only soy milk and coffee. The overall feeling is not bad, the hotel is relatively new and clean, but the sound insulation is relatively poor, often very noisy, there are subway and bus lines outside the hotel, there are direct buses to the Shanghai Zoo. There is no room for negotiation on the late check-out time of the hotel, which is not fun. Hotel Feedback May 20, 2008: Thank you for your evaluation of our hotel, and thank you for your suggestions to us. In the service specifications of our Home Inns, the front desk of rental items such as nail clippers should be provided for the convenience of guests free of charge. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you by failing to provide services to you this time, please forgive me! In the future, our hotel will pay more attention to such details and will not let you down anymore! The variety of buffet breakfast is different every day, usually A. B. The three sets of C are interchangeable. Milk, soy milk, coffee, black tea, orange juice and other beverages are also interchangeable. We will add some cold drinks in the summer. If you need milk, you can ask our waiter and they will be happy to serve you. , Welcome to our Home Inn Beihong Road store next time, we will definitely let you feel our progress day by day, and hope you will give us such an opportunity to prove it to you! 
0	A very general book, full of imaginary idealism, it is recommended that fresh graduates in the workplace should never read it. 
0	1. The screen has 2 dead pixels. ........T_T.................. 2. The temperature in the middle of the notebook is high, and the temperature of the transformer is high. 
0	By the road, too noisy at night. The breakfast is poor. Long-distance calls should be IP, and the charge is 0.8 yuan per minute. Additional comments December 25, 2007: The bath water is not very big. 
1	The traffic location is very good, the service facilities are OK. But the price is a bit high, maybe the reason for the higher prices of hotels in Taiyuan! 
1	The speed of the delivery is much better than expected. The quick-check wall chart is also provided with the book to facilitate timely search. Each disease is composed of these parts: symptoms, causes, and complications , Susceptible population, coping methods, home care. For young parents, some basic medical knowledge is introduced. 
1	To be precise, this is a children's novel written for adults. The narrative is touching in the ordinary, the strong and intelligent mother, the brave and honest and responsible Charlie, the simple and lovely Jasmine, the big Joe who is honest and brings happiness to the family, each Family members have the virtues that a person should have, and they have a huge impact on Xiaotuo throughout the process of growing up. Except for the interference of the colonel and the wolf girl, this is almost a perfect family, but The ending of one minute and six points brought people into sadness. Generally speaking, it is a very good novel. 
0	The quality and printing of this book are good, but it is only suitable for children under five years old. My child is eight years old and seems not interested in this book. In addition, this set of books is a bit expensive. 
0	The 14-inch wide screen does feel a bit smaller, and the viewing area is too small. There are 1 or 2 small bumps on the lacquer. The fan sound is quite bearable. Vista is not very accustomed to use, it must be reinstalled when it comes back. C drive is divided into 200G 
1	The author tries to analyze the contemporary Chinese economy from the perspective of Marx’s attention to economics. Careful people will find some of China’s policies and measures in the past 20 years and find clues in Mr. He Xin’s article. As early as 2001, the author predicted that the world would explode in ten years. The rare reason for the crisis comes from the author’s own statistics and rigorous logical reasoning. Intellectuals who can contribute to the development of the country as their own important tasks are rare now. Look at the independent and sensible people of those listed companies. I think Mr. He Is a great intellectual 
1	Good work; relatively light. The volume is much louder than my T61, and the sound quality is good. Other weight, easy to get fingerprints, is not a problem. 
0	It is too troublesome to install the system. I mainly work in office, but keyboard typing is easy to miss, serial. The key of G is not in good contact. 
1	The books I snapped up were very cost-effective, because I already had the books, so I bought my personal love and gave it to my colleagues. 
1	Unexpectedly, this is a super standard 3-star hotel. I really like its wooden floor, unlike carpets, no odor. And the room is quite clean, there are no sanitary corners. The service attitude is also very good, and the lobby is very comfortable. The location is really nothing to say, it's super convenient, you can go anywhere. Overall it is great value. The drainage of the bathroom seems to be a bit poor, but many hotels are like this. 
0	The layout of the room is a failure in Feng Shui, the toilet is clogged, and it is a helpless night!!! 
0	The hotel feels older, it should be a longer time for renovation 
1	"This is a book introduced in the authentic Japanese version! The Japanese who compiled the book, so the example sentences used in the book are very authentic. Every dozens of sentence patterns are divided into one group, and each group has supporting exercises, which is convenient for checking and consolidating knowledge points after learning! I have read many Japanese grammar books on the market, and I feel that this set is the most valuable! In addition, I recommend the ""Japanese Language Proficiency Test Preliminary Question Bank"" series, which is also highly valuable and can be used in conjunction with this book. However, the question bank series is worthy of its name. There are only questions and answers with almost no explanation. For friends who are not solid enough in grammar, choose carefully. "
0	The room decoration is poor and the facilities are not good, the breakfast is average. The location is remote. 
0	An Analects of Confucius, which contains a wide range of rigor and profoundness, has become beautiful and gorgeous under Dan's interpretation, and the gray dogma has become a gorgeous literary feast. 
1	1. Although it is small, my big hand is okay, and the keyboard feels comparable to IBM. 2. The battery is really strong, the workmanship is very good, and the heat control is also very good. 
0	I bought several books together, and the others are okay. Only this one is of poor quality and it is very pirated. . . . . . . . 
1	At more than 11pm on July 16, 2008, I checked into this hotel because it is very close to Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport, less than 10 minutes' walk. There is a lanky young man at the front desk of the hotel. Although it is late, the young man has a very good attitude. The biggest thing I feel about the room is that the bed is very clean and comfortable. The bathroom is equipped with a hair dryer. The cabinet is equipped with two gas masks. A detailed emergency evacuation diagram is posted behind the door. When I got up the next morning and opened the curtains, I saw the small mountain trail behind the hotel, green, with beautiful scenery and good air. In addition, the hotel also delivers breakfast, which tastes good and makes eating more comfortable. 
0	There is such a bad hotel, the one downstairs is satisfied, and there is no pick-up, free of charge, I really doubt you are a matchmaker. There are no paper towels in the four-star hotel, and the bathroom is small. Three corners of each corner are filled, one of the corners has not been cleaned for a long time, there are disgusting yellow marks. The towels are rough, especially the bathrobes can be said to be horrible. The hotel uses time-sharing air-conditioning, and it is difficult to get there. The wind is very small, calling for maintenance Personnel, even if they didn’t even look at the face, they said they couldn’t fix it, or change the room. The strangest thing is the TV. My friend walked barefoot in front of it and got a signal. When I walked back, the signal disappeared. It's miserable. I stayed this night and we both got a rash. I don't know if it was bitten or the utensils were not clean and allergic. Originally staying for two nights, I had to drag a suitcase and hurried to escape to the center. The hotel was really a wise decision, and finally I didn't dislike Yantai. 
0	1. The rubber tray of the base is easy to fall... 2. The usb port on the right side of the fuselage is not sure whether it is insufficient power supply or a hardware problem I remember. After the mouse on the street, the mouse shows that there is power, but it cannot be used normally. Change the USB on the left, everything is normal 3. The general problem of the notebook, the power transformer has a large battery 
0	I bought three medical books in Dangdang, this is the worst. I feel that the author is a liar, the language is not readable, and the recommended health methods are even more incredible. I dare not try. Look at Dangdang’s sales rankings. I bought it. I was fooled, not the book I wanted. 
1	The pictures in this book are very touching, such as the alumni praying for Laura, the smiles of Whitney and Matt, very touching. 
0	My son is 4 and a half years old. I got this book and I read it with him. I felt that the picture was too messy. The child didn't know where to look, and it would be very tired to read a few pages, but the storyline was naive, a little younger. Maybe you will be interested! But I don’t know why this book is written for a wider age group. In short, when I bought this book, I felt that the price was not low. I hesitated. Later, the website always recommended it and decided to buy it, but I was disappointed after reading it! There is no publicity! This book has one advantage: if it is a drawing book, it would be good. There are different car, airplane and animal shapes in the book, which is very beautiful! 
0	I expressed my opinion a few days ago, but it was deleted by Dangdang staff. I won't say anything more, I just want to say one more thing: this book is really not worth reading, the writing is plain, the plot is contrived ~ so many celebrity recommendations, I can only say that the publisher is amazing! ! 
1	I will have a baby right away, and I am looking forward to the birth of the baby, so read the books on tutoring in advance. Reading this book is really good. Not only can I learn how to educate children in the cluster, but I also gain a lot from the cluster. The Jewish nation has gone through so many wars, hunts, and persecutions, and it can still exist, and many Jews have become the richest man in the world. And they have made outstanding achievements in other fields. It must not be denied that this race is excellent, and it cannot be denied that this has an important relationship with the education they received since childhood. This book is worth reading and careful study. 
1	Ingenious design! Equipped with balanced configuration and cost-effective, it is an improvement over the TC series. Good heat dissipation. 
1	Incorporating a new high-strength engineering plastic + piano paint shell design, it really brings a new and full sense of fashion to users visually; T6570 dual-core processor, the latest 45 nanometer technology, independent graphics card; equipped with a high-definition camera above it , It is convenient for users to conduct business meetings better; LED backlight screen, more environmentally friendly and energy-saving 
0	I am still dissatisfied with VISTA. My friend said that this is a transitional system, just like WINME back then, it will be replaced in less than a year. Say it. . . WIN7 is good, but it seems that there is only a beta version. 
0	But the wireless network card sometimes loves to break! Moreover, there is no manual at all, that is, now everyone knows how to use it, not everyone has the skill to study it! I don't know if Lenovo is lazy or it is necessary to save some weight and put all paper in the machine! hate! The power cord feels a bit short! Not long enough in some places! 
1	It's better than expected. It seems that Golden Key Alliance still has certain quality control. The room facilities are OK, but the smell of smoke is too strong. When I came back, my pajamas were full of smoke. Breakfast is very average, with few options. But the service ecology of Pakistan is very good. Right on the Yalu River, the surrounding environment is okay 
1	This book, as gorgeous as summer, has been deeply impressed by me. The touch in my heart is still rippling in the lake of my heart. It will not be calmed for a long time...This is the first book I read Xiaoxi , Since then, I fell in love with Xiaoxi. The ending is beautiful for me. From the beginning, I liked Ou Chen very much, and Luo Xi also gained irreplaceable peace, which is very beautiful... But maybe I am more unlucky, The third book was missing more than 30 pages, so I had to buy a new one, but I didn't feel distressed at all, this book brought me far more than the dozens of dollars! 
0	Heat generation seems to be a common phenomenon, maybe it is the reason of the hot weather, the screen is a little small, and it will fatigue after a long time. 
1	Mature hotel, rooms and services are not bad, business rooms, equipped with LCD screen computers, Internet speed is also very fast. Especially there is no problem of poor sound insulation in general budget hotels. The location belongs to the city center, not far from everywhere. Disadvantage: When you get out of the elevator, there is a strange smell, is it summer tide? Fortunately, there is no in the room. The breakfast place is too crowded and the variety is average. Generally speaking, Zhejiang Hotel is not bad, and the room price is a bit more expensive. If it is 100 yuan cheaper, it will be very competitive. 
1	The room is relatively comfortable, the hotel service is good, the lobby is bright and clean 
1	During the physical examination, it was found that I had mild fatty liver. According to the book, this was caused by the accumulation of visceral fat around the liver. I am usually busy at work, and I just dismissed a few steamed buns for breakfast. Noon is a working meal, which is high in calories and no nutrition. I often accompany customers to dinner at night. If the diet is unhealthy and irregular, visceral fat will accumulate in the body, and naturally there will be mild fatty liver. The book introduces the self-examination method of visceral fat, and there are many suggestions for reducing visceral fat, which are very practical. I decided to adopt the suggestions and methods that suit me. 
0	1. When you go out in a hurry, if you ask children to call a taxi, they call the black car in the hotel. The price is twice the normal rental price. When you asked for the black car in the hotel, they told you that there was no taxi outside. When we went out by ourselves, the outside taxi could be stopped at any time. Occurs more than once during the stay. 
1	A good book that makes people cry. It's worth having. Dangdang is good, and it can correct deficiencies in time, ^_^, continue to support!!! 
1	The appearance is more beautiful, I personally feel that the white real machine looks more beautiful than the picture. The performance is not. The best graphics card can be bought at this price. The overall configuration is relatively balanced, and the interfaces are more and comprehensive. It is worth buying 
1	This is a novel that shows the social life of contemporary Chinese urban and rural in a panoramic manner. There are three parts in the book. In the past ten years, the author has portrayed the images of many ordinary people from all walks of life through complicated contradictions and entanglements. Labor and love, setbacks and pursuits, pain and joy, daily life and huge social conflicts are intertwined in a multitude, profoundly showing the difficult and tortuous road ordinary people have traveled in the historical process of the great age. Especially the protagonist's spirit of hard work in the face of difficulties still has a great influence on people today. 
0	It is inconvenient to install the XP system, and ASUS official website does not have a special driver for this model, so you can only download a similar model. 
1	Jingdong's price is not bad, the R series is more practical, the configuration is better, and it is not bad to use. Originally I planned to buy 6700, but when I placed the order, I found that it was only 6300, which saved 400 
1	I didn't plan to buy a laptop, but I bought one when I saw that the price was good. Overall I feel pretty good. Although it is a low-end product, it is better than other brands. 
1	"I strongly recommend the story of ""White Snake"", which originated from a legend. The white snake is a female and the green snake is a male. The two agreed that the green snake will marry the white snake if the green snake wins. Otherwise, the green snake will become a female and serve the white snake for a lifetime. Xu Xian. The background is the Cultural Revolution. The girl fell in love with the dancer who performed the white snake, and the woman approached her disguised as a man. Finally, the two married in a disgusting nostalgia. The writing is great, and it is divided into ""official version"", ""civilian version"", and ""unknown version"" to tell the sensitive stories of this sensitive period. recommend! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! "
0	When will the price be reduced, the new product is CQ40-514TX 4200/2G/250G/512 alone, the price is lower than 404!!!! 
0	Hotel special reminder [2008/02/29 -2008/08/30] The overpass reconstruction opposite the hotel. The tips provided by Ctrip were inaccurate. It was not the transformation of the overpass on the opposite side, but the transformation of the road at the entrance. In addition, many roads in Kunming were forbidden to left, and there was a traffic jam. . . . . . Just lived in on May 04, 2008 and it blocked me. I walked from the airport at 10pm and drove for more than an hour. The hotel facilities are already old. If you don’t build roads, it’s okay to go around. The attitude of the waiters is average. When I checked in, I took the big and small bags by myself. I opened the room without paying attention to it, so I went up by myself. The Chinese food in the hotel is not good, and the rice noodles for breakfast are okay, but there are too few varieties. 
1	This time, I found that I have worked hard on the service. For example, in the aisle, there are newspapers in the bathroom. The restaurant breakfast buffet service, and the elevator service are all attentive. In fact, the hotel service hardware does not have to be luxurious, but you must treat the guests sincerely. I hope to persist. 
1	A great book. I used to prefer to read books written by foreign scholars. The author asked me to change my attitude towards Chinese scholars. I used to think that Chinese scholars lacked the depth of research and would only analyze the current situation based on the existing knowledge of the course, and could not make any constructive opinions. Tribute to the author! The fertility system in this book is worth a look. It allows people to understand the social causes of some of the problems in people's daily life, such as sex, marriage, and family? . 
1	Very nice hotel: The waiters are courteous, generous and kind. Check-in procedures are completed on the way to the airport; when you check in again, turn down the bed and adjust the room temperature, which is called pre-service. The quality of the food is good. Recommend to members! 
1	I have been reading it for a long time at the starting point, and I heard that a physical version has been published. I bought it for my collection, so that I can continue to recommend this book to others. In the sea of books where everyone wants to be a big man who subverts the world and controls everything, it is really rare to see such a small person who writes ordinary hearts, and to write such a creative and hilarious book! I can’t read while eating or drinking water, I can spew rice; I can’t read it when I go to work, and I’ll be caught out of laughter... It’s a book that makes people very happy and often feels very warm at the same time. You can easily read it in one breath. Very smooth. 
0	Seeing the recommendation is good, I bought it. The baby didn't seem to like it and threw it behind the sofa without even looking. Depressed,,,,,, 
0	There is a dead pixel on the screen. During the night test, the hard drive is ticking. The screws on the back have traces of being removed, which makes people feel uneasy! JD.com gave away many things, and even a mouse was so stingy. 
1	The hotel service is good, and the environment is also better! Especially it seems that the revolving restaurant on the 48th floor is full of characteristics, at least I feel satisfied with staying in this hotel! 
1	I read it the second time, I like the detailed description of Edward and Bella's relationship development. I like it very much. I read it repeatedly, and I downloaded the English version for comparison. Like~~~ 
0	I believe in myself, no matter how I behave myself, I really live my life seriously. At the age of twenty and ten, if you can’t do something exciting, how can you return to the heart of twenty when you are thirty and forty? Do not compare what you should do in the period 
1	"The service of the Blue Sky Hotel is absolutely good. Every hotel staff smiles when they see every guest and says: ""Hello!"" The service is very attentive, the restaurant’s dishes are also very good, and the facilities are very complete. Our family is very satisfied with the five-star service and decided to go to Weihai next time and stay at Lantian Hotel. "
1	"The father of my baby has been working outside for a long time and rarely is at home. The baby is one and a half years old, and he seems to have not found the feeling of being a father yet. I bought this book to teach my baby how to get along with his dad, teach his dad a little ""theory"", and let him know how important his role as a dad is. As a result, there is an effect. Seeing her husband holding the baby in his arms, teaching the baby to point to pictures and words with his fingers, saying ""My dad is as tall as a house, he is really good!"", and then the two of them made faces as they did in the book. , I am secretly proud, ha ha. . . "
1	The rooms are very good and the facilities are very new. Overall, it is very satisfactory. The surrounding is very convenient, there is a shopping mall next door downstairs. 
1	The price is moderate in this area, there are breakfast shops, small restaurants nearby, more convenient, no breakfast and no place 
1	The price is very affordable. After comparing this price, almost no one can beat it except for the cow. But the workmanship is better than the cow number. The appearance of Sapphire Blue II is also very good. The configuration of the machine is also very reasonable, except for fingerprints which are not very useful. Good character, perfect screen, Samsung memory, Western Digital hard drive, and the screen is also Samsung's. XP is very easy to install, just use the depth 6.2 directly, without changing the IDE. The resolution can be set by yourself to facilitate the game. 
1	This set of three volumes is very exquisite and very good in content. After my seven-year-old daughter got the book, she sat on the floor and read it for two hours. I really liked it. Then I put them on the head of the bed, looked at them from time to time, and often asked me what animal knowledge I wanted to know, and then explained to me, they looked like an expert, very cute. She asked me if I have an animal encyclopedia, and a plant encyclopedia, I said there must be, and I will buy her another set of plant encyclopedia. However, my daughter refused to read the CD-ROM attached to this set of books. She prefers to read the text by herself. 
1	A very cost-effective one, it is recommended to buy! I added a 2G sliver, which is super cool to use! 
1	Beautiful appearance, 13-inch golden ratio, floating keyboard design, very low noise, very quiet compared with Dell issued by our company, and the camera effect is considered satisfactory. 
1	Chi Li is a writer I like very much. Anyone's praise of their children is out of love, like beauty in the eyes of a lover, and narcissism are two different things. Although this book does not have any specific educational concepts, it has at least two enlightenments to us: be a kind person and be a person who pursues art. If a child can be physically healthy, mental health is benefiting society. Yichi, such a sunny child, was maliciously slandered out of context. I only sigh: The forest is big, and there are all kinds of birds! 
0	The packaging is exquisite, the content is flashy, and the Korean humor is really not good! It doesn't sound good, it's just shit! 
0	The heat dissipation is poor, the heat in the chassis is large, and the hard disk is basically above 50 degrees. The VISTA software is for the home basic version, not the home premium version mentioned in the introduction (please explain to Jingdong). It is heavier and has poor portability. 
0	It would be great if there is a driver for XP. It took 5 hours to find the driver, but now it's all installed. 
1	Not bad, the room is big enough, because I have brought the children, I ordered the TWIN BED room, and said that the 3rd and 5th floors are not required. When I went there, there were no rooms on other floors. The front desk took the initiative to arrange a double room and added a bed for free , The attitude is very good. 
0	The facilities are average and relatively old. The environment is noisy. There is a restaurant on the second floor with mixed personnel exchanges. When checking out, the waiter who cleaned the room even falsely accused the toothbrush for use, dizzy! It's ridiculous and infuriating! It is estimated that this waiter took it himself, and in turn falsely accused the customer. It is recommended not to put those charged items in the room in the future. Customers who need it can go to the grocery store below to buy, otherwise some low-quality waiters use or take the charged items themselves, which makes the guests annoyed. 
0	Everyone knows the benefits of reading aloud to children. The key is how to read and what to read. The examples in the book are all foreign, and there is no reading list for Chinese children. 
1	I bought a notebook with this configuration at this price. There is nothing to choose from. There are many things to give away, the machine is good, and the configuration is reasonable. In addition, the camera is very clear. 
1	I stayed at this hotel when it opened in 1998 and I felt very good. I chose to live here when I went to Qingdao this year. Ten years have passed, although the hardware is slightly outdated, I still feel very satisfied with the service level. 
0	Qianhui has not seen the book arrived in the past half a month, and has not seen any reply. I feel deceived when buying books online in Dangdang. 
1	Relative to the price, very good. But the soundproofing of the business double room I booked was too poor, and the sound of the phone and coughing in the next room was clear, so there was no privacy. 
0	The hard disk sounds loud. It seems that this batch of products of Dell has this problem, and both E6400 and E5400 have the problem of loud hard drive sound. 
1	The quality of the book I received yesterday is not bad, and it comes with a CD, and the quality of the CD is relatively clear. I have learned a little yoga before. I read the description in the book, and I have learned almost the same before. It should be more suitable for beginners, and the overall difficulty is not very great. The content of the CD is consistent with the explanation in the book. In addition to the introduction of basic yoga movements in the book, there are some dietary introductions in the last chapter, which feels more practical. Generally speaking, I am quite satisfied with this book. The only little regret is that the price of this book was reduced the next day I ordered, but not much, hehe 
0	It’s really enjoyable to live in this hotel. Not only can you use the colorful white towels, but you can also listen to the treble performances in the KTV box of others for free.!! The following are the words of the singer,,,,,thank you, first of all, I I want to thank my parents and my friends who support me behind giving me the opportunity to influence everyone with noise. Now I will dedicate one more song to you!! I hope you can't sleep at night!!!!!! 
1	I bought a book on Dangdang for the first time. I chose it for a long time. I finally chose <Fantastic School Bus>, <Pippi Longstocking>, <Different Carmela> and <Fabre Insects> as gifts for her daughter Liuyi. <Faber Insects> is my daughter's favorite. It must be read every night. I read it if she is illiterate. Basically, I read one book in two nights. To be honest, the language in the book is very easy for children to understand. You can easily learn about insects. Once in the park, my daughter gave her dad a lesson on red ants and black ants. Children who are interested in insects must not miss it! 
0	When receiving the goods, it was found that there was no CD, and the delivery person said that all the goods must be returned. In the end, I had to place another order. The other items to be bought were out of stock. I was worried. I don’t know if they will have no discs when they are delivered, and I have to return them because the book is intact. 
0	If you don’t have XP, you have to install it yourself, and if you have any problems, you can only wait and you can’t return the goods, even if you just ask it from the counter, it’s a bit unspoken. 
0	The quality of the book is good and the printing is exquisite; the content is very readable, and there are basically no typos. However, the procuratorate has written it as a prosecutor’s office, and the story is too ideal, especially the conflict between Daixi and the company, Wang Wei, etc., some plots are not It is logical. 
1	The only regret is that the book has some quality problems.There are many thick needle-pierced holes in the middle of the first three or four pages. 
0	This is one of the worst four-star hotels in the country I have ever stayed in. The first thing you get when you enter the room is that the lights are dim. I think I can only go to the bathroom to read the newspaper, because the brightness of the bathroom lighting can reach it. I am 9 pm I went to the hotel more, wanted to take a bath at 11 o'clock, but couldn't turn on the hot water. I called the main station and found out that there was a problem with the heating pipeline in the city. I asked me to wait patiently. It was not available until 1 o'clock in the middle of the night. I also found the hotel manager Liu on duty. I drove 12 hours a day from Shanghai to Weihai, so I could take a bath and have a good rest. 
1	The facilities are very good; the surrounding environment is good, close to the golden sand beach; recommended sea view room Insufficient: relatively partial; not easy to eat; the hotel's own restaurant is too cost-effective. The price is too expensive and the taste is not good; 
0	Why do you have to close SATA when reinstalling XP system? Now that there are no such organizations as Tomato Garden, it is very troublesome to install a system. This module is protruding in the middle of the keyboard, and the hp540 I bought before is the same. It feels uncomfortable to hit the middle. The three usbs are too close. 
1	Compared to a hotel in this price range, it is still very good. The rooms are small but very clean, and the toilet facilities are also very sincere. The taps are very large and the washing is very comfortable. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but it is a buffet The kitchen is connected to the dining room, and the food prepared by the waiter is taken out. It looks very warm and really feels like home. The soundproofing effect of the room is not good. 
1	Lorca is highly respected by my teacher. On that magical university night, talk to the teacher about Lorca. Because I will also go. It turned out later that I was not talking about the same poet with him, I was talking about Cavafy. But this does not prevent us from talking about poets. At that time, we did not realize that we were talking about two people, and we still enjoyed the process with relish. I found this book on Dangdang.com, nothing can stop me from buying it. Well, I have no plans to read it yet. 
0	The location is too remote, the facilities are a bit shabby, and the shower curtain is still in use. I wanted to borrow a hair dryer, but the waiter said no. It turned out that there were hair dryers installed in other rooms, but I didn't have standard room B. There is no such minimum service, not as good as other street hotels! Additional comments April 16, 2007: The front desk service is really not very good. When I entered the hotel, a large group of front desk staff didn't know what they were discussing, but nobody ignored me. Besides, the breakfast is really hard to swallow. The breakfast on the roadside is definitely better than it. 
1	"""The law is pragmatic."" This book is easy to read. ""Civil procedure law is a subject with strong practicality, and civil procedure theory cannot be separated from judicial practice. Issues such as judicial reform, judicial corruption, difficulty in enforcement, and revision of the civil procedure law are all very specific and realistic issues. An abstract theoretical issue. We should think about how to make the basic litigation system work in China. The basic theory will lose its effectiveness if it loses its effectiveness in China."" "
1	The workmanship is good, the main thing is that the price is really 2400XT. I looked at the online notebook graphics card rankings, and it was relatively high, compared with the 9300, so I chose it. I saw the 3-star model before I bought it. The 3400 model with a 9200GS unique display cost 3999 and only has an extra camera. I didn’t see it clearly before I bought it, so this model also has a camera, sweat! ! I went back to open the CS, and I turned on 32 computers without a card, the graphics card was not bad, and the touch of the sound above was very sensitive, and it was reflected by touching it. Very cool! The appearance is blue, but I actually prefer black, but not. regret! 
1	"I read her ""Tea Man Trilogy"" and finished it all in one go. Have been searching for her text, all. Thanks Dangdang, as I wish! She is really ordinary, but her words and thoughts are really extraordinary! I have read more than a dozen tea books before, but most of them should be burned compared to her writing! Some people understand tea, but the written text is sloppy and unworthy! Some people don't understand tea but they dare to write! What's rare is that she can write about the beauty of tea without losing its superficiality, researching without complacency! Let her express the same meaning with the fragrance of tea! "
0	It's not as interesting as I expected.Maybe for the child, it is much more suitable.In fact, there are not a lot of useful tips in the book.A lot of mistakes listed by the writer is related with wrong spelling.To me,it's not really funny. 
1	Long battery life, about 7 hours, compact size, good keyboard, and XP system, more worry-free, and it is very convenient to partition by yourself. 
1	China has also published an emotional book. After reading it, it is a very good book for women to understand men better. When I read it, I have a lot of sympathy, because it is the behavior mentioned in it. As a female, I have almost all the perspectives and it is very appropriate. It also broadened my vision and saw a lot of different things between men and women. Looking at things will not be as subjective as before. This book is worth reading. As a modern woman, not only this book, it is a bit regrettable. Because you are out of touch with society. 
1	Lived in Shijiazhuang Shijiazhuang, International Building, and later stayed in State Guest. It feels good: the rooms are spacious and the facilities are ok. Fruits are delivered every night. The breakfast is richer. It's just that check in and check out are slower, and it needs to be improved. Hotel Feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of the Ambassador Hotel. During the Olympics, the registration procedures are quite complicated. We are studying the details of the work and simplifying the registration procedures as much as possible. We look forward to your visit again and make valuable suggestions for our work! Happy life and all the best! 
1	"Looking back on this collection of essays carefully, I found that all I liked was Maning, who wrote ""The Classroom Facing South, No Kite"". I don't know if she grew up or she stopped moving, she didn't feel anymore. Maybe it was her wisdom for life, but it couldn't move me anymore. She felt that she was aloof, far away from herself, so it stopped here. . . "
0	I have bought the DVD of Cat and Mouse more than 10 times on Dangdang.com. In addition to giving as a gift to relatives and friends, some children, I also leave it to watch for myself, and I will never tire... 
0	The quality of the service staff is not high and they make mistakes frequently! Obviously, I reserved a good room for my colleagues, but I gave the room card to someone I didn't know without checking the name. Such a low-quality error! 
0	I saw Teacher Yu’s lecture on TV and I thought it was good. I bought this book. But I want to say that this book has no collection value. Can I watch TV or watch TV? 
1	Pictured it is small and easy to carry. The heat is not very large. It has a pearly white color. I like it very much. The keyboard is very comfortable to press, and the touchpad is very user-friendly. 
0	So average, will definitely not stay here again, the service is average 
1	It is currently the best hotel in Xinchang. The environment and service quality are very good. The free domestic length and free broadband are still quite attractive. It is only a short walk from the Big Buddha Temple. It is too convenient. Additional review May 4, 2008: Hotel Can you not taste the Bai Zhan Chicken and Reservoir Chopped Pepper Fish Head in the Chinese restaurant on the first floor? Stayed for two nights and ate two meals. In my opinion, the characteristic taro dumplings and noodles are not necessarily suitable for the taste of Shanghainese. 
0	After reading Dangdang’s recommendations and online reviews, I made up my mind to buy it. After reading it, I found that it was not as interesting as I imagined. Sometimes I felt naive. I don’t know if I really don’t satisfy me or I don’t understand Korean style. Humor! 
1	Super hardware configuration, perfect support for vista, smooth running speed, no need to upgrade hardware within one or two years, it is estimated that it can keep up with the mainstream. 
1	Hotel service is very good. Several times, the hotel was upgraded to a deluxe room because the standard rooms were sold out. Hotel Feedback July 3, 2008: Thank you for staying at the Ambassador Hotel and recognize the hotel’s services. We look forward to seeing you again! 
1	"The first bonus software (Office2007, McAfee) is to decide whether to install it at the first startup. Unlike many brands of notebooks, you can install them all at once. And after actual use, I found that many of its built-in practical software are very good and very user-friendly! After I went home and used it carefully, I found that the keyboard feels as good as everyone said. In addition, I fell in love with it the first time I used the little red dot-it feels much better than the touchpad, no wonder it will become one of the ThinkPad genes. Although the machine is a bit heavier, it feels very solid, much more solid than some ""entertainment books"". "
0	No wireless network card switch was found. In addition, the asus logo under the screen generates amazing heat, which is very hot in less than ten minutes! 
1	I introduced it to my colleagues and bought them for my colleagues. I still like it very much. 
0	"The introduction said it was very good, but after reading it, it was not worthy of the name, preaching, and empty. There is no actual case that is far better than another book, ""Meeting the Unknown You."" "
1	It’s been a few years since I bought this book, but this magic has been used all the time. Hehe, it works. Generally, you only need to count to 2. When you first use it, you must be firm and the punishment must be immediate. Don’t be too long, it can be five minutes, not more than ten minutes. Now this magic 123 is basically used by me for eating. When I go to bed, children and old public meals can’t always be at the table immediately. Sleep, too, count to 3. Turn off the lights. My husband is extremely cooperative in this method, and the effect is very good. 
0	It is a very poor hotel in Tianjin. I booked 4 single rooms, but 2 of them had no windows, and 2 of them could only see the roofs of buildings very close to each other. The price was still high and the breakfast was not included. It was really bad. I checked out a day after 2 days. I chose because it is relatively close to Tianjin\Nankai University. I would never live here. At best, it is a quasi-two star. 
0	I installed it in the USB flash drive, and I recognized it this time and formatted it immediately and then proceeded to GHOST. Hey, everyone should have guessed that it was installed, but there are still many things to do later. Installing the driver is the most troublesome. 
1	Good things, take them back, the first feeling is good things! The packaging is formal and there is no opening! Open the outer carton, the inside is beautiful medium packaging! Taking out the computer is beyond my imagination. Things are beautiful! It is the demeanor of a major manufacturer, quite satisfactory, and unassuming. I added a 2g ddr3 and 1066 memory! The installation is a deep system! It's all done in half an hour. The ld at home says this is worth it! I already have an x200, and it feels similar! 
0	The battery is not 6-cell, so it takes only one and a half hours to use it. Is the CPU so good, but it’s absolutely okay to use online games 
1	The appearance is good, the heat dissipation is actually good, and it is not as hot as my original Dell when playing live. Various touch keys and indicators are very beautiful, typical design features of Japanese electrical appliances. Price is also good 
1	Heqing’s business single rooms can be called luxurious, with particularly advanced facilities, especially the rare advanced toilets, which are rarely available in hotels. The price is acceptable. 
1	"The book ""Big Chinese Medicine"" is really good to read. After reading it, there is always an urge to learn medicine, haha.................. At the end, it is still not enough, and there is always a feeling of not finishing. Just like Song Hao's master, who is that Taoist? And that Gu Xiaofeng, who is the gate of life and death, is also a mysterious figure, and whether the magic formula without medicine can finally be released, and whether the mysterious or even magical treasure can finally be released, these are all mysteries. The author has left too many fans, I don’t know if I want to write a continuation, I really look forward to it! ! ! "
1	Beautiful appearance and good speed. The upper row of touch keys is very practical. Should be worthy of this price. Of course, everyone will certainly not object to a lower point. The fan is not noisy. 
0	Check in on Saturday, cost 340 yuan, including breakfast. The overall feeling is not like a three-star hotel, the lobby is very empty, there is a restaurant in it, it does not feel very good, the elevator is at a corner, not too convenient, the room is one You see the bed when you enter the door, unlike a hotel room, but the water is better, I won't stay next time 
1	The screen is big, the configuration is powerful, the appearance is OK, the heat dissipation is no problem, the quality of ASUS can be trusted, and it is very good as a home machine 
1	Located in Western District, in the old city of Hong Kong, there are bus and tram stops at the door, the transportation is relatively convenient, the hotel environment is average, but relative to the price of 390 yuan, it is relatively cost-effective. 
0	The room was so small, the TV became a decoration and couldn't be turned on, and the waiter was indifferent. Will never enter this hotel again 
1	I read the preface very carefully, and I read a small book in one breath. Indeed, as the preface says, the stars also have melancholy shadows, unsolvable confusion, unchangeable loneliness and loneliness. Obviously it is a certain emotion at a certain moment, but it will also become an analysis and interpretation under rational thinking, but it cannot dispel the inner doubt and anxiety. I don't know if this is a low point or a fragile period in his life. Looking around, I found the feeling of seeing Lu Xun again, with a sharp rational side and a soft emotional side. 
1	Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad, good value for money 
1	The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Although the surrounding area is not lively but very quiet, it is very quiet from Hongqiao Airport. Usually the price is very expensive, but because the check-in coincides with the Spring Festival holiday, the price is great! ! ! 
0	The heat dissipation is average. I originally wrote that there is no inner bag. I bought another one with money. But I found that it was matched. It lost 200 oceans after two days. 
0	Dangdang sent the wrong goods to me and refused to refund the shipping cost. I said that because the courier company has already delivered the goods, I admit that the courier company has already provided the service, but the fault is Dangdang. It should be Dangdang to bear the freight! It's unreasonable, it's just stealing money!!!!! 
1	Even depraved, painful, poor, humble, and penniless. We just need to be kind and brave. This. Is our own world. This is not just a children's book. You will read humanity in a seemingly naive and boring plot. You would think, if everyone in the world would be like this princess, would there still be violence, suffering, and unfairness? No, if everyone in the world read this book seriously. you will see. Rebirth. Spring blossoms. 
1	The hotel of the Shenyang Municipal Government is more atmospheric and convenient in transportation. Beiling Park is on the left when you go out, and the environment is good. 
1	I liked this set of books at first glance. The workmanship is exquisite, the cover is exquisite, and the pictures are very realistic and realistic. But I think it’s a bit early for my baby at 23 months to read this book. The text of this book is too long. The baby doesn’t have so much patience to listen to the entire story. Even after listening, I personally think he will not understand too much. Many, and the colors of the pictures in the book are not very rich, and the small animals have few movements and expressions, which can not attract the little baby. If the older baby should like this set of books, I plan to keep it until my baby is older. 
0	In some places, the workmanship needs to be improved, especially the bezel and edge of the SD slot do not fit well. 
1	Obviously the credit card is guaranteed. I ran to live and said there was no room. I had to upgrade. Finally, the hotel did not charge the upgrade money. But it was still very unpleasant. But the hotel is good. Marriott's management is good. 
1	Fingerprints and Bluetooth are available, and they are independent. The price is also the lowest on the market and very affordable. Home delivery is very convenient and assured. 
0	It’s okay for the first time. I feel that the author’s example is well written, but if you taste it carefully, it’s just rubbish. The examples are blunt. Zhuangzi will jump out of the grave to commit suicide when he sees it. Level. 
0	Because I was interested in psychology some time ago, I bought the first and second episodes. I haven't read a novel for a long time. I put it on the bedside and read it little by little every day. No disappointment, because I never placed great hopes on a book. All I can say is that it is out of the ordinary, and it is a bit nauseous after reading it. Freud attributed human psychological problems to sex, and this book follows this principle well. But the bridge in the book drags the whole book from a high starting point to a nasty place. The female psychologist is just an empty halo. This is the first time I read Bi Shumin's book, and also the last time. 
0	The biggest drawback is that there is no phonetic transcription, which is not very convenient to read, and the content of the book is not funny at all, or the author has a limited sense of humor. . . 
1	"When my father was not at home, the children said to me: ""Mom, will you be a father today?"" "
0	It's not bad to use, I still have a few 2000-100 1000-50 East coupons plus qq 673946022 
0	"Suddenly I found that everyone was holding a copy of ""Those Things in the Ming Dynasty"" before realizing that it turned out to be 4, and I quickly bought a copy from Dangdang. It feels so-so, I can't go on seeing half of it. "
0	I saw a lot of comments before, saying that I was very excited to buy it. I was very disappointed when I saw it. The hype is big, and the practical little author boasted that his story accounted for less than half of the book. Just look at his blog 
0	"This hotel is basically the kind of guest house where low-priced Hainan tour groups live, and the surroundings are extremely desolate. It is very close to the three towers, but outside the back/side walls, there is a distance of about five or six hundred meters from the gate. The room is not small but still use ordinary ball lock + take the key by yourself. I haven’t seen a four-star guesthouse like this for a long time. You must press the side of the house when you go out, otherwise you will open the door completely all day. Up. In addition, it is known as a four-star, but the detailed consumption bill (water bill) cannot be provided at the checkout, and from the boss to the customer service manager to the front desk staff have never heard that the accommodation hotel issues an invoice and provides a water bill. . The service industry suggested to take the water bills of other hotels to see if they could print it out, but the customer service manager said, ""We have computers and printers, but we can't use them for you to print!"" and asked whether this represents an individual or In the hotel, the answer is to represent the hotel. -Caused me to fall into the phone-the handle is cracked! As for the compensation for damage to the item, it is also quoted casually. Note: An ordinary local phone has the ""original price"" of 200 yuan, and it is not allowed to go out to buy a seat for compensation! What's even more ridiculous is that if you say that you have imposed too much fine, you will immediately double the amount with a bad attitude, and ""don't even want to leave if you are less than 400 yuan"" (the boss, the boss). I had to fight for a good attitude and get the ""original price"" compensation without paying the invoice. Breakfast is sometimes a self-service. Although the food is not very good, there are about ten kinds of things. It is no problem to eat. However, there are fewer residents and it becomes a meal (known as table meal), and there are only two or three varieties. I promised to be with the shuttle bus in the ancient city. Although it was off-season, I contacted by phone one hour in advance as required. However, I made 4 urging calls on the spot and waited 30 minutes for the bus to arrive. About 2km). In addition to the low-cost tours offered by travel agencies, I suggest that you stay in the many hotels in the ancient city. The price is generally half the price here, and it is convenient to visit the ancient city at night. By the way, have any of you ever seen a four-star standard room with no internet access? There are WLAN signals everywhere in the ancient city, and I go to the ancient city with my computer on my back. After Ctrip's online complaint, Ctrip said it would consider whether to sign a contract with such a hotel next year, and rewarded 500 points. Unfortunately, the loss of time, cash, and mood cannot be made up for. "
1	The work of this book is very good. Everyone loves, the flowers bloom. Since I bought this book, my waist is no longer sore. The leg doesn't hurt anymore. Work is also vigorous. Waiting to count the money. 
1	"I got the book this morning, and I feel that the delivery speed is relatively slower than before (or maybe I have too much expectation for this book that I feel that time passes very slowly). When I got the book, I couldn't wait to open it. The quality was good. I knew Mr. Nan for a long time, and I have never had the opportunity to read his book. The response to this book on the Internet is pretty good. A good classmate also introduced me to it, so I bought it as a collection and saved it for later taste. If this book feels good after reading it, I will continue to buy Mr. Nan's ""Lao Zi He Said"", I believe it will be a good choice. Lifelong benefit! "
1	A very good laptop with an original mouse inside, which is a surprise, ha ha! 
0	The system vista needs to adapt for a long time and there is no pre-installed office. The software package presented is not free. Norton only has a 90-day usage period. The machine is a bit heavier and thicker. 
1	Started with 3399, sent a package to send a radiator, the overall is very good. The speed is good, the overall workmanship is also good, the appearance is beautiful, the keyboard is relatively special, a bit not suitable, 1G single modern DDR667, 16:9 is also good, invisible. The sound effect is quite good, at least the treble is clear, and the bass is fine; the camera is the clearest 30W camera I have ever used, but the position cannot be adjusted. The expansion port is very complete, the USB is also scattered, and the drive disk is very complete and easy to install. Better than Hp Asus 
1	1: Good appearance, very suitable for MM. 2: High performance-price ratio, all necessary functions are available, because I bought it at 3699, ha ha. 3: Perfect screen, fast response speed, the overall function of the machine is still being tested. 4: By the way, why did JD choose postal logistics? From Guangzhou to Shenzhen, the first order was not received for 4 days, but the price was reduced by 300. Happy, cancel the order immediately, reorder it, and mention it by yourself. 
1	Good heat dissipation, good workmanship, durable, classic, memory sticks directly use DDR3, so as not to be eliminated later! The steel hinge is very strong! 
0	Some disappointment, not as good as expected. It is more suitable for kindergarten children to read. But not very good for elementary school students. 
1	1. The screen resolution is high, independent display, suitable for drawing 2. The speed is fast enough 3. There is no problem, the use is very normal, 4. 3DMark runs more than 1800 5. Perfect screen 
1	Small and light, affordable, the package is pretty, the memory is the same as the original memory, and the speed is very fast after adding 
1	Staying in Dalian Fulihua East Building, newly renovated, better condition than West Building, I will choose again in the future! 
0	The soundproofing is very poor, the traffic is acceptable, the facilities are relatively outdated, and overall it does not feel like a three-star hotel. 
1	The TV is too small, the subtitles are not clear, and the service staff is still very good. MM at the front desk attitude is very good 
0	Oh, how should I say, this is the worst four-star hotel I have ever stayed in, or a VIP building, dizzy! The hardware facilities are estimated to be only two-star standards. The price is too low! 
1	"My daughter used to play the game ""What time is the old wolf old wolf"" with my neighbor's young lady. This time I saw the storybook and liked it very much. On the way home from the kindergarten, I walked and watched. When I went home, I didn't care about eating and reading. Even if I went downstairs for a walk, I couldn't bear to leave her precious book. I overcome the Pinyin Pass in one night and finished reading a book by myself. I think this book is especially suitable for children in large classes. The story is lively and interesting. The pictures and beautiful characters are big and have pinyin. Children can spell it independently, and there are not many pages to scare them. They can easily master the spelling and stories without knowing it. "
0	"First of all, it doesn't feel like a big hotel. It should belong to an apartment hotel. The rooms are very small, obviously modified from residential apartments. Secondly, the service of the doorman is not good. I stood there stupidly, I went in and looked at me stupidly without saying hello , Don’t smile, it’s better to put a dummy like an airport, the first impression is bad. Of course the front desk service is also very general, said it is from a diary, but it is not if I take the initiative to call and ask for it Sent. If I say that the price of more than 300 yuan, I will not say anything, but the price of 600 really makes me feel too worthless. Additional comment on January 16, 2008: One additional point: the attachment is not convenient for transportation, said Here I want to criticize Ctrip, describe this hotel near Yaohan, check the dictionary to see what ""nearby"" is. Hotel Feedback January 18, 2008: Thank you for your kind criticism of the hotel. The hotel criticized and dealt with the managers and employees of related departments, and re-adjusted the work process to prevent the occurrence of missing gifts. I sincerely hope that guests can stay again and supervise the hotel's services so that the hotel's services can be more perfect. "

1	The location is very good, the city center, the room can see the peninsula and the river, and the dining (revolving restaurant) is very good. Hotel Feedback August 7, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and love to our hotel. Liuzhou Hotel is committed to building the most cost-effective hotel in Liuzhou. The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
1	This time I stayed in a double room, and the room facilities were OK, not as old as I thought. The bathroom seems to have been newly made, and it is quite clean and tidy. The hotel's service is okay, and the front desk is still answerable. Additional comments June 21, 2008: Breakfast is on the 25th floor, with very few colors and very average. 
1	"Compared with Long Yingtai's ""Children Take Your Time"", Xiao Wu's book tells you more theories, allowing parents to look more urgently at China's educational environment. While admiring them, they also deeply feel the lack of knowledge about parenting. The former resonates with you invisibly, while the latter is to give parents a dose of vaccine. While enhancing the critical awareness of parents, it also reminds you not to forget to learn so that you can keep up with the pace of growth of children. It is more suitable for parents of preschool children, and vaccinate parents and friends in advance. "
0	"My daughter, who is almost 4 years old, likes it very much! I also bought ""100 Princess Stories for Girls"". Because my daughter recently liked Disney princesses, I bought it. I also bought the full set of Carmela plus this Seven volumes, she didn't expect her daughter to listen to the princess story only, and this Carmela's, she had to take it over and read it by herself, and she giggled. . . . . . After reading it several times, I found that this is her favorite book among the books I bought in the past few years.. "
0	The price/performance ratio is too bad, and the lobby is not grand. Average room, average service, will not live in the future 
1	"""There must be more fun things in life than sleeping!"" Carmelas big and small have always held this belief. They persistently pursue things that are considered unthinkable in the population. Going to see the sea, to pick the stars, to chase back the escaped sun... There are bumps and hardships all the way, but the dangers are always turned away from bad luck. Finally, you can reap unimaginable returns and extraordinary fruits. We can think of Carmela as a symbol, an indispensable ""partner"" on the way to growth. Reading a different Carmela will make you a different person! ——Children's reading promoter "
1	After buying the book that internal factors determine appearance, I found this companion book. It took two nights to read it roughly, and I think it’s good. There are not only many small formulas, but also the author’s attitude towards life. Although the pace of life is fast now, we cannot live as refined and elegant as the author. I don't have the time and energy, but I will do some of the things that can be done daily, as much as I can do. This is also a kind of care for myself, ha ha. In short, this book is suitable for girls to read and learn 
1	The luxury business room is very large, but it is quite large and unreasonable. The hotel carpet is very dirty, stains can be seen everywhere, and there is lingering alcohol in the air. It is recommended that Ctrip visit Huayang Hotel, which is a step away, and many locals Friends recommended us to stay in Huayang. 
1	The heat dissipation is very good...The heat dissipation of the notebook I have handled is very good, and it does not feel hot for an hour or two. Performance is also good. I feel the operation is quite cool. 
0	Can not install locks, CD-ROM reading ability is not too good, YTO Express is too outrageous, there is no notice of arrival, directly to the company security, when I see? The carton packaging has been opened. It is recommended that JD.com pay YTO 200 more for each order! 
0	It may be the misleading of other people's comments. This book still doesn't make much sense. It records a picture of a woman with no characteristics in a flowing water! Why are so many published? It is strange! 
1	Lightweight, powerful battery, large enough keyboard size, easy typing, cpu performance, good WLAN performance, and relatively garbage camera 
0	"Yu Dan's ""The Analects of Confucius"" is simply nonsense. Except for ""The Analects"", she was all right! Her speech was good for building a harmonious society, but it distorted the basic spirit of Confucius. This book is called ""Yu Dan's Experience"", which is more accurate. "
0	If you don't buy it, you don't need to buy it. It's enough to take a look at the Sina online reading channel. Doctor Bi's writing technique is too old, and he is not suitable for writing similar things for those who are too old-are they still yelling at the discovery of lesbians? Is there a story in this book that is beyond imagination and makes people clap and wonder? Can't stand it. . . 
0	"1. Outdated equipment. The wallpaper peeled off, the towels were worn out, and the light bulbs were not on. 2. Use Japanese goods. TOTO bathroom, SONY TV. 3. Breakfast is very poor. There are no small tables in the whole restaurant, but big tables for ten people, which feels like a big dining hall. The most annoying thing is that there is no fruit, it is hard to imagine a four-star hotel. 4. The price is chaotic. I entered the hotel at 10:48 in the evening, and the price was 420 yuan. After checking in, I found that I would check in after 11:00 in the evening, and the price was 180 yuan per night. If I stay for three nights, I get one night free. I feel imbalanced in my heart. It feels like ""bad"" in one word. Originally booked a room for two nights, I escaped from the hotel at 8:30 the next morning and moved to the new space-time Conifer Hotel not far away. "
1	My daughter is in the fifth grade, and there is an excerpt from the old things in the south of the city in the Chinese textbook, so the child asked me to buy her the whole book to read. My daughter saw the kind of beautifully illustrated book bought by her classmates. After taking this book back, she found that it was different from the classmate’s one. But after reading it, my daughter told me, Mommy, the book’s The illustrations are also very beautiful! Yes, buying books is based on the content, the hardcover version and the hardcover version, as long as they are good books, they are actually the same. 
0	"Ctrip's order stated: ""Room features: one 1.3*2, the other 1.1*2 meters, no extra bed, all rooms have free broadband"", the actual room I have seen after check-in is the smallest standard I have ever seen In the room, the two beds are the same size. Both sides of the bed are against the wall. There is no extra space. There is no place to put luggage, let alone the cupboard. It is different from the room proposed by the hotel and they said we The air conditioner in the booked room is broken, so I can only change this room for the same price. I don't know if this is a fraud by the hotel or by Ctrip. I ask for compensation. If you need evidence, I have real room photos. In addition, it is recommended that you do not travel to Mount Tai. Almost half of the hotels will experience power outages without warning. "
0	I haven't seen this book before I bought it. I heard what they said was a mess. It's enough to turn a few pages. The content is too rough, and it is unique to Koreans. I don't like it very much... 
0	The quality of the book is very good, the paper is very thick, the pictures are very beautiful, the pictures are big, but they are all naive, not suitable for children in third grade, (my daughter is in third grade), my daughter said she did not like it, especially an English book The word book is purely a collection of words. 
1	I used to watch Mr. KEVIN’s participation in the “Women I’m the Biggest” program. Every time I watch his explanation of makeup, I always gain something. Moreover, listening to his introduction to make-up is always easy to understand, and he feels so enthusiastic to teach everyone what he knows about skin care and make-up. As soon as I got the book yesterday, I couldn't wait to start a new round of learning, and I also gained some skin care knowledge. And I like the arrangement of the whole book very much. Of course, it would be better if Mr. KEVIN produced another DVD special and sold it with the book. 
0	The wine is really bad, and Ctrip is very irresponsible. I spent 308 in a deluxe room, and the price/performance ratio is 150. It is a chicken coop. I suggest all friends not to live in it! I am actually speaking, please think twice before staying! destroy!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
0	It is very troublesome to buy without a system. . But it can be considered a savings. The mute light does not turn on, I don’t know if you have any solutions. 
0	I have stayed in many Dalian hotels, and this one is the worst. The hotel charged 100 yuan for less than an hour when the guest stayed in the room. The lobby manager Shi Jinlin had a bad attitude and spoke bad words to guests. I have never seen such a hotel. , I advise everyone not to stay in this hotel. 
0	The hard disk partitioning crashed me very much. The C drive was 221G, which was only 250G in total. I don't know what the people who partitioned at the time were thinking. I also got the after-sales service to re-divide it, disgusting. 
0	Arrived before 2pm on February 11th, my friend and I had a total of four people and booked two double-bed rooms. When we arrived, there were four waiters at the front desk. Before us, there was a waiter who was helping a family of three to check in. , The other three waiters stood there blankly, and I asked them whether they could check in for me, and replied: wait. This way of doing things has made me very upset. After finally checking in, the waiter gave the room card to the doorman. The doorman ignored our 9 big bags on the floor and rushed in with the card. We sweated on the spot. He called the doorman back, and reluctantly helped us take two bags. The rooms are in the bottom two rooms on the third floor of Building 3. This building is very quiet, quiet and creepy. The building is very old and there is an abandoned factory around it. The door of the room is a green wooden door, and the door to the bottom has a broken sensor and uses the key directly. The room is very large, very empty, the TV is very fuzzy, the bathroom is very small, it is a shower room, the facilities are very simple, far from the four-star hotel advertised by the front desk staff. In short, the first impression of this hotel gave us very uncomfortable, but what happened next was even more disheartening. Turn on the faucet, the water flowing out is very yellow and dirty, both rooms are like this, call the front desk, the front desk asked us to call the housekeeping department, so I called the housekeeping department again, and said: I just rinsed the water tank in the morning, do not leave the faucet on for ten minutes Off, it will be fine in a while. So we turned it on for a full 20 minutes, but it still didn’t get better, so we called the housekeeping department again to ask what was going on. The housekeeping department said to turn off the faucet. Now too many guests turn the faucet on. The water keeps flowing and the sediment deposits. If I don’t come down anymore, I asked when it would be better. She said it would be better in two hours. So we turned off the faucet and went out to visit Gulangyu, and we left at 3:30. We went back to the hotel at 7 o'clock in the evening and turned on the faucet. The water was still yellow. Call the front desk. The front desk said that the water at the front desk was also yellow. I didn't know when it would be better, so let me call the housekeeping department. Calling the housekeeping department, the housekeeping department said that the engineering team was rushing to repair it, and that the water pipe was broken. So when will it be repaired? The other party directly hung up my phone. I was already very upset. I couldn't wash my hands or boil water. Moreover, the front desk and the housekeeping department were very impatient when answering the phone. Now they still hung up my phone. Another phone call back to the housekeeping department, asking why she hung up on my phone. The other party actually denied me in every possible way, and asked her when she could fix the water. She told me that she would ask the engineering department now and give me an answer later. So I started to wait for a long time, and there was no reply after a quarter of an hour. At this time, we were very disappointed with the hotel and very dissatisfied with their service. So I called Ctrip and told Ctrip about the process. , I hope that Ctrip can call the hotel to reconcile, but the connection lady said to me that you should contact the hotel. I don’t know if the connection lady didn’t hear me clearly, or it’s just reading the text, I have told you clearly After negotiating with the hotel many times, the other party always shirked responsibility in various departments, and did not repair the water pipes for a whole day. Finally, I explained to the wiring lady the interests and responsibilities between Ctrip, Gulang Villa Hotel and the customer. The lady finally understood the matter and told me that she would call the hotel to let them contact me and give me an answer. A few minutes later, Ctrip called me and said it had contacted the hotel, and the hotel would contact me later. It was another ten minutes of waiting. No one in the hotel contacted us, so I called Ctrip again. Of course, I changed to a connection lady. Of course, the education on stakes and responsibilities was indispensable. The lady also told me that she would call the hotel to let them Contact me to give me an answer. A few minutes later, Ctrip called me again and asked me to wait for the hotel to contact me. A few minutes later, the front desk called and told me that the water pipe was under emergency repair and would be repaired soon. I asked how long it would take. I am going out for dinner soon. Can it be repaired after I come back? The other party said that it can be repaired, but I said, what if the repair is not good? The other party said there is no accident, I said it is impossible, what if it is not repaired? The other party finally said that if the repairs are not done, they will change rooms for you. I said to remember what you said. Then we went out for dinner. I happened to meet a tourist from a hotel while eating. I asked them if the water was available. They said that the water was good. I asked them which building they belonged to. They said building 2. I returned to the hotel two hours later and turned on the faucet. The cold water has returned to normal, but the hot water is still yellow, and the water is cut off from time to time. Call the front desk and find the lady who talked to me in front of me and asked for a room change. The lady said Your water is all right, why is your water still yellow? It feels like we are cheating on her, I said, come and see for yourself, and then she said to check what rooms are available, I said that the water in your building 2 is good, she said building 1, building 2. All are good. So the implication is that the water in our No. 3 building is not good, and it started to be bad in the morning, knowing that there is a problem with the water quality, we are arranged to stay. It is really too much! ! ! After a while, she called and said that there was a two-bedroom and one-living suite in Building 2, and asked me if I wanted it. I said what kind of bed it was. She said a double bed and a single bed. I said you call us. How do the four people sleep, she said, then she will check what room there is. After a while, she called and said that there was a standard room with sea view in Building One, and a small suite with one bedroom and one living room in Building Two. There was a room, so she wanted to fool us. I said I wanted to see the room. Then we went to the front desk. When we arrived at the front desk, she started to question our water quality. She always felt that we were fine looking for trouble. Please, it was already 11 o'clock, and we had to catch a plane the next day. If you don't want to sleep, we want to sleep! ! ! This service quality is really too much! ! ! Let her go to the room to check for herself but refused. Finally, the last two rooms are still normal. Although the facilities still cannot be measured by four stars, Shanghai’s two stars are estimated to be better than it. Finally, we conclude that the Gulang Villa Hotel is very old, with outdated facilities, a gloomy environment and extremely service attitude. Bad bad, extremely low work efficiency, very collapse! ! ! Additional comments February 25, 2008: Forgot to say, those two big bed rooms are also known as deluxe rooms 
1	"When I took the TAXI, I asked the driver how the hotel is, ""Old hotel, popular, good service, well-known."" When I arrived at the hotel, I felt very warm. The first time I came to this hotel, the staff were very enthusiastic, like knowing I’m the same, I’ve been on business for so long before I feel at home! The doorman went to find a car for me in heavy rain. When I got home, my pants were wet, which made me very touched. I can see the room, newly renovated, furniture/ The bedding is also new, but for people who have been on business for a long time, the feeling of home is more important./ "
0	Too dirty, the parking lot is too small, it is recommended that Ctrip do not recommend such a hotel 
1	Powerful performance, P8600 U, single 2G DDR2 800 memory, independent display, perfect screen, the same configuration, other brands have at least 7000 Vista score: CPU5.3 memory: 5.3 hard disk 5.3 graphics card driver not installed: 1.0 
0	The surrounding environment is poor, the service speed is slow, the attitude is okay, and the price is too high. 
0	My baby is 2 years old and 3 months old. It is when he learns what he says. I have blocked this set of books. I will read it out when he understands what is good or bad. There are too many words that babies shouldn't learn. I am a set of disappointing books 
1	The appearance and use of this notebook are pretty good, but the vista system feels that the response is a bit slow and troublesome. When using the program, it prompts whether to continue. I don't know if I can change this setting. 
0	I booked a triple room at the hotel where I stayed on a business trip. The room has no air-conditioning, it is deadly cold, and the quilt is very damp. It is next to the train station and within walking distance. It is said that the first local golden key is this 
0	It is the same as the used independent display notebook: the heat dissipation is a bit poor, the wine red is not as bright as the ideal, dark red, the notebook is a bit thick. 
1	Close to Gongbei Pass, the standard room is too small, the deluxe bed is good, and the service is good. 
1	"I think this book is good, because it is more enlightening than thinking, because there are no certain rules in the world, and the United States is good and cannot cover the development stage of China. The foreign students who did not return to the United States gave us an internal speech a few days ago. In short, they said how good human rights are in the United States. At first they agreed. Later, after thinking about it, they found a problem, that is, ""high welfare, universal suffrage, and inviolability of private property. ""As the basic point of the preaching, the best is the best, but it does not have a universal perspective. The so-called one yin and one yang say the way has not been broken. Say no more, readers know it. "
1	I like the ASUS brand and I have already bought a few. This one was bought for a friend. The price is good, but I just snapped up 4999 cash back 400=4599 and the goods have not been delivered yet, the price is 4499, which is very depressing. Product quality is a problem for manufacturers, but price quality is a problem for Jingdong! I think Jingdong should refund me 100 yuan! ! ! 
1	Perfect screen. The memory is added to 3G. It is really hard to find XP recovery disk when I installed XP by myself. IBM has more startup items. There are 70 processes. The Vista system is too slow. 
1	The system runs relatively fast, the keyboard is worthy of IBM, and it is very comfortable to type. After adding the free memory, the speed is still relatively fast. 
0	1. The sense of service is too bad; I booked a big bed room through Ctrip. After entering the room, I found that the carpet in the room was really dirty. I negotiated with the duty manager and asked for a room change. The answer is actually: there is no double room, either you will be replaced with a deluxe double room, but you have to make up the difference, or you will be replaced by a standard room. Can't figure out how to do the service industry? The inconvenience caused to the guests due to his own work mistakes seems to be right, and he is very confident. 2. The environment is too noisy 3. Breakfast can only be described as terrible, no matter if you don't eat it. Please stay away! ! ! 
0	Stayed here many times. But it feels that the service quality of the hotel is declining, and the price is rising. The downstairs of the room I stayed in was being renovated and it smelled great. I called the front desk, and the front desk said there was no room, so I was asked to be patient. It was solved by the front desk manager's theory. 
1	Very good, service and room facilities are very good. I went with my girlfriend on the Dragon Boat Festival. My girlfriend's mobile phone was out of power. I asked the main station to borrow a universal charger, and it came soon. The food there is also very good, delicious, ha ha. Overall good 
1	The configuration is not bad, installing XP is a bit cumbersome. The key is to find a disk with ICH9 driver. According to the online installation method, XP SP3 can be installed perfectly, which solves the problem of loudspeaker popping, and the sound icon can also be displayed. No heat is generated as others said. High, loud fan noise. 
0	In addition to the better environment, opposite Yunlong Park, the hotel facilities are too old, the price is high, and the price is low. In this weather, there are many mosquitoes in the room, and I was disturbed by mosquitoes several times in the middle of the night. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful and generous, the configuration is balanced and reasonable, the workmanship is great, the screen effect is great, the mirror is bright, basically only half the brightness is enough in use, the stability of the machine is good, although it is said that the amd machine heats up, my I didn't think 
0	"I felt cheated when I bought this book. The content in it is really average, but it's suitable for elementary school students. Through the 100 forums of CCTV10, Yu Dan became an academic star like Yi Zhongtian. It is true that Yu Dan has a very attractive personality and cultural temperament, but this is very empty and very one-sided. ""The Analects of Yu Dan"" has sold more than 4.5 million copies, which does not explain much, it is just the effect of the flock. If you are still at the elementary or junior high school level, I suggest you read Yu Dan's ""The Analects"" and ""Zhuangzi"" experience. For those above high school, it is best to read the series of works by Fu Peirong. If you read Fu Peirong's ""The Analects"" and ""Zhuangzi"", you will feel that Yu Dan's understanding of the Analects is far lower than that of Mr. Fu Peirong. To evaluate Yu Dan with one of the famous lines that Mr. Yi Zhongtian said in the forum of one hundred schools, ""but that's it."" "
1	Some people say that the 21st century is the century of the East, and the East depends on the rise of China. I think: Yes, the 21st century is the century of the revival and rise of the Chinese nation! But the prerequisite for this kind of rise is that we must clearly understand ourselves, see our own shortcomings, and also see our own advantages, that is, China's influence and influence on the world. I think this book has pointed out the things we want to know from a certain angle! 
0	The so-called promotion involves too much intrigue in the process. I don't like this style. It is purely a personal opinion. 
0	The content inside is very shallow, and not systematic, there is no need to buy and collect. However, the author's love for life is still worth learning. I believe that only those who love life can live hard. 
1	The front desk service is good, and all inquiries about travel are answered in detail. The breakfast is not worth three stars, and the room heating is not enough. 
0	Checking in on the 27th was just in time for the nearby construction. The first impression was not good. When I left on the 29th, there was a piano and violin performance in the lobby. When booking (large/double), I didn’t have to choose. When I checked in, I was told that there were two luxury double rooms, but I actually wanted one big and one pair. In short, it is not satisfactory. 
1	The main fancy is the 3600MHz system bus, which reserves a lot of space for upgrades, but it has not been verified whether it is 3600MHz. The price/performance ratio is not bad. 
1	1. Cheap and cost-effective 2. Discrete graphics card 3. Considering daily applications, LP will also go online and play QQ games at most. This set of configuration is sufficient. 
0	The author advocates internal regulation and distrusts cosmetics, which agrees. But the methods listed are too troublesome and the ingredients are not easy to find. Not too practical. 
1	Like all the friends who are going to buy this book, it is light and convenient, and it is also good to watch a movie. After adding memory, it is said that I can play Warcraft and have never tried it. There are genuine windows. As a milestone product, it is the first to create a product, first praise it. 
0	The location of the hotel is poor and the traffic is extremely inconvenient. The rooms are small, at most three-star standards, and the surrounding environment is poor. After I stayed, I didn’t feel very good. I checked out before 6pm, but the full price was charged, which was really disappointing. 
1	The look is pretty good, the price is good, and it feels pretty skinny; the driver is actually very easy to install, but the network card is a bit dizzy. . 
1	High cost performance, led screen, Western Digital hard disk, ddr3 memory, there is no big problem when installing the system. It is very comfortable to use. The heat dissipation is much better than others' hp, and the noise is also low. 
0	After reading a chapter, I left it on the side. I don’t know where to put the CD-ROM. It’s very rubbish. Many vocabularies are simply used. At least I don’t speak English like that in Office. I should speak a little bit more. In short, I won’t talk too much nonsense. The sentences in it are not practical! ! 
1	The machine is beautiful and cheap. The configuration is also OK, it is a bit troublesome to install the software yourself. Long warranty time. 
1	This hotel is basically my resident hotel. It is clean and close to the place where I am going to work (Central). If it is morning, I usually go down the escalator mid-level, about 20 minutes. If you don't want to walk, they also have a special car to pick you up, but the time may not match your schedule. The taxi comes from Central, which is 20-25 Hong Kong dollars. If you save some money, you can also go to the door by taking bus No. 12 to the Yihe Building. The waiter is very sweet, especially a girl named Angel, very patient. Only once I asked for a double standard room, which was really shocked. Putting down my luggage, basically my family of three can't walk around. The room is smaller than when I was a child, so I immediately asked for a room change. Of course, the upgrade would cost more. The sea view suite is nice, located in the middle of the mountain, with first-class night view. They also have private buses to Stanley, Ocean Park and Peak Tram Station. We saved a sum of travel expenses and time. They also have their own small restaurant, which is quite delicious and generous, and has all-you-can-eat soup and desserts for lunch. Afternoon tea is even cheaper. In the central area, the price is only this one. We walked home after coming down from the top of the mountain, which was about half an hour past Lan Guifang. Along the escalator, there are a lot of small food shops, eating is okay, a few open late, there are many customers in the middle of the night. There is also a very old and time-honored shop called Lianxianglou. 
1	HP's book is mainly to buy a high-configuration machine within a limited budget. In general, this machine is super cost-effective. 
0	How do I feel that the P8600 is the same as the T2390 of another Lenovo F31. . . Don't feel any difference 
0	I went to Xining for the first time, through a room reserved by Ctrip. I stayed in a room, and the bathroom smelled very big. In addition, there was a few waiters at the front desk who served bluntly, like a black-faced Bao Gong, and the location was relatively biased. Generally speaking, it is far from the four-star standard and the price is not high. I don't know how Ctrip will set it as a silver hotel, because I haven't stayed in other hotels in Xining. 
0	Advantages: The appearance is stylish enough, the configuration is very good, the price is reasonable, and it is very suitable for business use. Disadvantages: The optical drive occasionally sounds really loud, and the bottom generates a lot of heat. Summary: The special price of 4999 is still very good value, it is worth it 
1	"The quality of the book is very good. The layout is also good, it looks relaxed, but the content is a bit heavy. It has always been relatively repellent to look at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the concentration camps during the Second World War, the ""Dachau"" scary place. The Grim Reaper in the book is not as cruel and cruel as imagined, but is very childlike admiring Lisai. The cruelty of World War II made death feel physically and mentally exhausted. The description of colors in the book is really classic. Every time I tell my friends about the color part of the book, they are surprised by the author's thoughts. Write a review for the first time. Because it is indeed a book worth buying. "
0	Basically it's useless. I don't remember a few words after reading the book. I still have to memorize the words every day. Maybe I can't use this book or I'm too stupid? 
0	After delivery to the door, a gap was found on both sides of the computer monitor; the surface of the molded plastic was uneven. Very poor workmanship,,,,, 
0	Never want to live there anymore. 1. The transportation is inconvenient; 2. It is said to be a five-star, but it does not meet the five-star standard. The room is small, and it feels like home and fast, even not as fast as home; 3. Service attitude , The attitude of some people is really bad. The day I arrived happened to be 5.12. On the day of the Sichuan earthquake, I arrived at nearly 8 in the evening. Once there, the service staff said that they had not received the reservation. Many, most of the local people came here to hide, because this hotel is newly opened and the floor is not high, so there were no vacancies at that time), I heard it and asked them to confirm again, but their front desk staff was very absent I was patient and gave me a little temper. When I called Ctrip, there was a male waiter who was still laughing and happy. Later CTIRP confirmed with them that there is indeed this order, which is inside them. No handover. I will never go there again. Definitely not... 
1	I finally bought the book that I was reading. It was because of my first thought that when I waited for this set of books, a long time has passed. For whatever reason, when I found out that Dangdang had this set of books again, I did not hesitate. Wrote the order. I think this is a very meaningful review. After I bought so many books, this is my first review. I don’t know why, but I was moved by Ruirui. Love is absolutely true, and love never returns. Gu, sometimes in memories, always sigh, people like Yan Wang Zhu Di, love? Hate it? The twists and turns, the faint resentment, the two heavens of love, are tempting to me. 
1	It's so small and exquisite~ exquisite~ no noise~ good heat dissipation~ I thought it was a fake when I first got it in my hand, because it is too small, like a child's toy. It’s just right for girls~ it’s too pp~~ my little white~ Lenovo’s machine is great value~ I like it to death~~ Howoo~ It’s convenient, it can be put in a portable bag~~ 
1	Bought at 4999, come and bite me bought at 4999, come and bite me bought at 4999, come and bite me bought at 4999, come and bite me and also give bag and mouse!!! Wow hahahaha~!!! 
0	I just took it back and found that the position of the indicator light was opened, and I went directly to Lenovo's customer service to use double-sided adhesive. I opened the adhesive again in the past two days, and I was very upset! The memory is too small. Normally programming is still under XP, and then I start to run the hard disk. The power of the cup is not reflected at all. The price of 2g memory is prepared! 
1	Hahahaha... I can still continue to comment, so I will give it a full score. I will continue to live next time I forgot to say, there is a touch service in the room, but unfortunately there is no time to try it, and I will live next time ...... 
0	The quality of the book is very poor: the first few pages of the book received are bound upside down, and some pages are not bound and can be taken down directly. I sent it back to Dangdang for replacement. It has been more than 20 days and there is no news at all. I wrote an email to notify the reason for the replacement, but I did not see any reply. In order to exchange the goods, I have to make a special trip to the post office. This time buying a book is simply annoying. Such service is too bad. 
0	It's not so good, I was disturbed by the sound of karaoke late at night. The restaurant downstairs also caused a lot of pollution. 
1	International brand, compact design, good feel, fast speed, battery life is 5-6 hours, especially I asked the repair station, the machine shipped in January 2009 are guaranteed for 2 years, the battery is 1 year . 
0	Maybe it's the jade in front. I have bought the ** Meridian Massage written by another person. Looking back on this book, I feel disappointed? The more I look, the more dizzy, unintelligible, and too much nonsense. I believe that the author is an excellent healer but definitely not a qualified author. But if you have time, you can pick up a selection with a pen in one hand and a paper in the other, and there will be a few inspirations. But this book is really a book with a lot of water and a great degree of hype! 
1	The book was delivered at noon on Children's Day. After seeing the book, my son was quickly attracted by the beautiful and exquisite color pages and content. For the first time, he would rather give up sleeping and let me do the problem with him. I decided to buy it after reading a lot of good reviews. I really didn't expect this set of books to have such a great charm and magic. Haha, seeing my son like it is really exciting and exciting. Thank you Dangdang for timely delivery and for giving us such a nice holiday gift. Children can learn in a state of interest, and the effect is naturally more effective. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, I have expanded the memory to 2G, installed XP genuine system, the speed is very fast. I designed it in graphic form, and it took a week to find no problems. 
0	My book is missing ten pages, which seriously affects reading! Dangdang is such a big bookstore, how could such a problem arise? I suspect that my book is pirated. 
1	The author’s witty remarks connect the endless rock stars throughout the 60s and 70s with his own story. What is homesickness? What is rock? It is a maverick attitude that looks arrogant but warm, it is a kind of deep loneliness and unwillingness under peerless independence. Words and music will only arouse the same feelings in the readers’ hearts when the two sorrows collide. No matter what At times, the world is changing, and our idols are slowly getting old. The time when we were ever young has drifted away. So rock and roll has become the most heartbreaking blues 
1	This is a very talented young man. Every student who has just passed high school may wish to read this book and reminisce about the youthful season he has gone through. The ancients often said: Young people don't know the taste of sorrow, and they say sorrow for new words. For some reason, today's young people write very well, and the writing is rarely far-fetched. With the venting of the true feelings of the words in the book, readers will often fall into the retrospect of the past. No matter how many generations have passed, the lives of those years are very similar to all young people whose hearts are first opened. Left hand reflection, right hand years. Youth is a sour choice between giving up and gaining. 
1	Flash is divided into two parts: programming and animation. This book is about flash CS3, but the use of scripts is still AS2.0. This is the latest script format used by flash CS3, which has been gradually eliminated, but AS3.0 is completely Not involved, and even in the course part of using scripts, people just copy the code that has been written by themselves, without explaining the detailed composition of the script, and some steps in the basic drawing part of the animation in the book are omitted, completely beginners can see It's a headache, but overall, it's a very introductory book, not too bad 
0	The original note is in English, why can't you leave it in English? Isn’t it better to have ten words? All in simplified characters, the pictures are not necessarily attractive, they will be given to others 
1	The performance is good and it is very cheap. I have been driving for a whole day, and the body temperature is still quite low. Several function keys are also very easy to use. 
1	This hotel is really good. Staying here for 4 days gave me 3 surprises: 1. The room is bigger than I thought, and there is a sofa. 2. Fruits are delivered every day. 3. The waiter is in a conditional situation I will help you wash your clothes for free (washed a pair of jeans for me). I will stay here again when I have a chance to come to Wuxi. 
0	I checked in a month ago. First of all, the decoration is very old, giving people a sense of lifelessness, and the other is the service. They are all aunt-level. It can be counted as 4 stars after 10 years. It is hard to say now. 
1	"The Xiamen Hotel I stayed in in July was very good. The front desk staff was very polite. I casually mentioned the free upgrade of other guests, and immediately helped me upgrade from a double room to a double room for free. The room was very large. It’s a bit far away from the bed to watch the TV, ha ha. And the waiter met me the next day and greeted me ""Miss XX, hello."" He remembered very well and helped me apply for late check-out on the last day. Unfortunately, she didn't remember her name (it seems to be Zhou xxiu), otherwise she can call to praise her. The room facilities are also very good, I think they are still new. And the hotel itself has its own garden for walking. Diagonally across the road is Wanshi Botanical Garden (I highly recommend tourists and friends who want to take an afternoon flight on the last day to spend a few hours in the morning. It is very large and well maintained. Botanical Garden). The hotel is also within walking distance from the lively pedestrian street. There are buses at the door to the airport, Gulangyu Island, Xiamen University and other places, which is extremely convenient. I will definitely stay here next time I go to Xiamen. "
1	The price is cheap enough and it is considered a big brand. And add one yuan and also give away memory sticks, which is great! Metal palm rest is good for heat dissipation. You can refer to the following link to install the system: http://blog.zol.com.cn/1118/article_1117706.html 
1	After using it for a few days, the overall feeling is okay, no problems are found. Jingdong’s speed didn’t say, place an order the night before, and pick up the next day! 
0	I have been repeating that if a man wants to praise his performance, if a woman wants to listen to the point of view is a bit single, at least it can't give me any enlightenment and help. It is very different from what I expected at the beginning. Personal feeling is very general. 
0	Poor service! ! ! The attitude of the waiter is very bad! The environment is also average 
1	The u100 plus is cheap, has a decent appearance, and has a long battery life. It supports 802.11b/g/n and Bluetooth 2.0, and is quite good compared to other brands at the same price. 
1	This HP machine is well-balanced and has a slightly smaller memory. It would be great if Jingdong sent me a memory. The appearance of the notebook is simple and it is worthy of being a commercial type. The keyboard design is very characteristic. The LED screen display effect is very good, the color is more beautiful. 
0	The facilities are too old, the service is terrible, and the attitude is bad. 
0	The appearance is different from what I imagined. It is a computer made by Compro, which also belongs to HP. There is no system, it is very troublesome, and there is no driver disk. I think the driver disk should be sent. Until now, my SM bus has not been driven up. Nothing on the pipe network. 
1	It's very convenient to carry, the keyboard is easy to use, and it feels good. It is much better than my original notebook. IBM is IBM and no brand can replace it. 
0	I lived here because I attended a friend’s wedding during the Spring Festival. It didn’t feel very good! The room was small and dark, and there was no big light in the room. The bed sheets didn’t know if they were in this color or what they were. It felt a bit dirty! The bed was still very dark. Small! There is nothing to eat for breakfast! But since it was delivered, I won’t say anything! 
1	Haha, I went back to the deluxe twin room again, and I felt that the room was bigger than the standard room, not so depressing, and the bed was bigger and more comfortable. The TV is too small, and friends in the countryside probably don’t have such a small TV anymore. The bathroom is still too simple and does not match the overall positioning of the hotel. There is a lack of bathrobes in the closet, so I can always provide two sets, which are available in the cheaper hotels I have stayed in. 
0	Just renovated when I checked in, the smell is very strong! The bed in the room seemed a bit shaky to sit on! 
1	Aesthetic characters and beautiful stories have come into contact with many stories in the context of this era, but the author’s delicate writing, just like a faint fragrance between teeth, makes people tasteful and accompany me to spend two lonely nights, infinite melancholy, but the character description is not deep enough. There is no outline of the characters after reading. Personal affairs and chores seem to be too many, not connected enough, and the ending is even more inexplicable. It makes me suspect that there is a problem with my understanding ability. I over and over again study carefully, but I can't see any expert to give pointers. 
1	Catch up with the May 1st promotion, the workmanship is ok, the interface is enough, and the price is acceptable. The battery is strong. The external mobile hard disk does not need to be connected to the power source, it is directly recognized. 
1	Good service, fast checkout, and good taxis at the door. Most importantly, the breakfast is really good. Single rooms are reasonably priced, but standard rooms are not suitable for one person. 
0	Compared with the last time, I feel a lot worse...The toilet keeps leaking, and the waiter who cleans the room in the morning is like a home. The whole floor is restless, and I want to sleep longer. At night, the KTV speaker on the 2nd floor I stayed until midnight. Not only could I not sleep on the 3rd floor, but I also had difficulty listening to the sound of the TV. Next time I go to Yangzhou, I will definitely change to a hotel. 
1	The appearance is exquisite, the price is cheap, bought at 4299, comes with a package, anti-virus software and mouse, comes with a system disk and driver. They are all good and satisfied! 
1	"Diet adjustment and supplementation are inseparable from the performance and application of food. This book has notes on the nature, taste, function, indications, dosage and usage, and contraindications of some commonly eaten foods; in the same medicine and food, medicine tonic is not as good as food tonic."" Based on the theory of ""Eat"", it can cure, prevent, and replenish the body by eating in daily life. It is a comprehensive and professional book, and its practicality is quite strong. Such a price is still worthy of it. For the content, I strongly recommend everyone to buy it, which is very helpful to family health! I bought two copies, one for someone else, and one for my own use:) "
1	The mold work is good, the keyboard feels good, and the screen is perfect. The quality of ACER should be guaranteed, the warranty is 3 years, and the overall price is very high! 
0	The top ranking of this book is exaggerated, and it feels less than the full set of circles. 1) Many stories in the story are far-fetched and have poor logic. 2) If it is just the above reasons, it can be accepted casually. After all, some tricks and tricks are still useful in actual work. Seeing the tail of the story, I feel that the author is in a hurry and is extremely irresponsible. Wang Wei's inexplicable disappearance is really incomprehensible. Although you are mainly talking about the workplace, the integrity of the story should be considered and be worthy of readers. 3) Books with poor logic cannot give high marks! Not recommended to buy! 
0	The display effect of the screen does not seem to be very good, I don’t know if I just got it, it won’t adjust or other problems, the memory is DDR2 667 inserted in the memory slot, friends who need to add memory should pay attention 
0	"The hardware and software are not up to the Samsung standard. I checked in at around 2 in the morning. There was no one in the aisle and there was no light in the front of the room. I found it by myself. The facilities in the room are old and musty, and the bedding looks unclean. The water was not hot for a long time, I ordered 6:15 to call early, but the lady forgot to call me almost 7 o'clock. The first sentence was ""You probably have gotten up"". I booked the high standard online, the minimum is 193 yuan, but the hotel advertised ""Leisure Room 118, High Standard 168"". In view of this, I asked if there is a room when I entered the store. The lady repeatedly asked me if I booked, but she didn’t answer positively. No guest rooms. I asked the hotel about the room price. The hotel said that my room was of high standard and was an annex of the presidential suite, and then that the promotion was aimed at locals. I pointed out that the hotel should communicate with the website in time if there is a promotion. If there is no communication, the website guest should be settled at the promotion price at least, otherwise I have to check out early, and the hotel said that it would give me a better room. It gives me the feeling that the hotel lacks due integrity and tolerance. I checked out early and found that there are many newspapers there. Although the general conditions are not comparable to those in Shanghai, the prices are cheap. "
0	If you choose to place an order on Saturdays and Sundays, you can only order on Thursdays. Otherwise, the user is required to cancel the order after three days and re-order is considered inhumane. It should be within 10 days at the user’s request. 
0	I don’t understand why the machine has a clatter and noisy noise. It seems that no other user is like me. I went to Samsung’s after-sales service today to ask if it’s a quality problem! 
0	Dignified four-star hotel, wrong room number. The user returned the room according to the order, and the feedback to Ctrip was early check-out. Can this service meet the four-star rating? 
0	Lots of horses and horses. But this building was originally like an office building, most of which are people's offices, and a few floors are guest rooms. The rooms are not big, the facilities are a bit old, and the breakfast is even more ineffective. I really think it is a miracle that he can be rated 3 stars 
1	The emotionally evaluative language of parents towards their children often becomes the original basis for judging right or wrong in the life of the child. Although the child will be modified by the external environment as he grows up, this modification will never touch him The core view of childhood. Therefore, to some extent, the attitude, content and quality of the parents' speech will become the self-image and thinking style of the child throughout the life. Is it optimistic, confident, full of thinking and spirit, or negative, low self-esteem Or pass by and give up. It can be seen how much influence parents' attitudes and words towards their children have on their children! 
1	"The most benefited from this book are these two articles 1. No coldness in the heart and no fear of warming up. 2. The skin doesn't like frosty beauties. Beautiful women must warm up the body. All other problems will be solved. To be honest, I used to pay too much attention to ""cold"", which made my health very bad now, and my spleen and stomach were extremely cold. Began to realize that I need to be good to myself and work hard to improve my lifestyle. It's much better now, relying on the books of these benevolent doctors. thank you very much! "
0	In an old five-star hotel, the window of the guest room we stayed in was the closed terrace of the hotel. Under the window, there were items like discarded quilts. Fortunately, we stayed for one day, and the curtains were closed for one night, and we hurried out the next day. 
0	I’m totally unworthy of the words “causing the trend of a third country”. I’ve never seen the feeling of the author writing like this. The author’s thinking is confused and often pops up some inexplicable words when creating. Disturbed personality too soon 
0	"Very general, I feel that the protagonist's heart is very dirty. I have read Yu Hua's ""Brother"" before and was disgusted. ""Female Psychologist"" and ""Brother"" have a match, but the text is more scattered. Fooled! "
0	The look is not very business, the plastic is strong, the screen is small, and the mouse is not sent. I have a 2000-50 Dong coupon that is not good, and everything else is OK 
1	The price/performance ratio is extremely high. I bought 4699 in Suning, and Dongdong only 4399. The functions are very complete, I am satisfied with it, and enough. 
0	Really incomprehensible room price, the room is clean, but like a temporary room, there is almost no soundproofing, Kunshan hotel prices are too outrageous! 
1	The hotel rooms are large, which is the biggest advantage. The facilities are not very new, the air-conditioning in the corridor is too cold, you can only turn off the air-conditioning in the room. Overall is good 
0	Pages 251 to 267 are missing, replaced with pages 239-246 and repeat. Too unhappy. It’s okay to look at the contents of the books casually, and the history books look good like this. In a word: Books that can be read but not worth collecting may refer to such books. 
0	"When staying in the big bed room on the 11th floor, there is a clear musty smell from the carpet as soon as you get out of the elevator; the windows of the room cannot be opened. Even so, there are mosquitoes. The most terrifying thing is that there is a spiritual event. Stayed for 2 nights, the first day was fine; the next day, at 3 in the morning, I was awakened by the sound of ""di"" and ""di"". When I saw that the desktop computer in the room started automatically, I read the CD after that, but it failed. Scream. In the past, I could not turn off the computer by pressing the power button, so I had to unplug it. However, I always use my own laptop, and I have never touched this desktop. Really will never go to the hotel again. "
0	The name of Dangdang does not match the truth, and the order will not be delivered for many days. Asking the customer service will only defer, and will only ask the user to place another order. Such service can't keep customers. It is better to go to other websites to buy books. 
0	The book should be righteous for people, so I don't think this book is of much help. The name of the book is quite tempting. But after reading it, I feel that the content written in it is also very general. It's nothing. When I bought this book, I heard my friends say it before I bought it. After reading it, I felt regret. . . 
1	Located in the old city of Hong Kong, you can experience the life of Hong Kong residents. The traffic at the door is very convenient. If time is not tight, it is good to take a jingle car! There are many small restaurants around, and the breakfast is served at the north and south behind COSCO. The food is very good. The big bed room we ordered was quite quiet, and overall it was good. There is no UnionPay at the front desk! 
0	There are always a lot of people following the trend, and I followed one this time. As expected, the content is mediocre, and there is no readability at all. 
1	Although it is an old hotel, the equipment is quite complete and the price is reasonable. The location is very convenient: Next to Jiefang Road is the main road. Go south to the station and go north to the iron tower. There are countless mobile phone shops around the hotel. It is very convenient to pay for phone calls or buy stored-value cards. Fully equipped: even 220V to 110V adapter socket. Buffet breakfast: It is a local Chinese meal with rich content. Service attitude: The front desk, room service, restaurant and other staff are very kind and actively try their best to help travelers. Staff service attitude is really comparable to five-star. I really want to find out what needs to be improved, but the bathroom is a bit narrow. 
0	The order 5216523 and the request for reissuance of gifts on June 3rd. It is now the 20th and still has not been reissued! Now all the big gift packages are out. Ask for a satisfactory result. Don't delay and delay!!! (And we I found the keyboard problem when I got it, and I have taken it to fix it. Only a few days after buying it?) 
0	LINUX pre-installed I think it is better to install a DOS. Generally novices can't do the system. Novices can do the system but don't know how to rebuild the MBR. The instructions are all in English. The MSI after-sales service is only available in the province. 
0	It is really troublesome to install the system. First install it with an ordinary system disk (because the version of my system disk is relatively old), and then boot the hard disk directly after installation. After entering the WINDOWS interface, install it again with the GHOST CD! ! (You cannot directly boot the GHOST CD from the CD-ROM drive) 
0	There is a color point. At the bottom left, it's not very obvious. And the right Shift key on the keyboard is not well designed. Too long. It occupies a larger position than the Enter key, and it is often easy to use it as the Enter key to press the wrong key. There is no Express port. A little hot. The sound is a bit low. 
0	Although there are some minor problems with my keyboard, this is an isolated phenomenon. I know this myself. I did not contact JD. I directly contacted the ThinkPad customer service. It is currently being processed. I believe it is not a major issue. ThinkPad can help me solve it. 
0	Summary: I have seen a bad four-star hotel, and have never seen such a bad quasi-four-star hotel. Detailed description: 1. Infrastructure problems: The hotel promises to have broadband Internet access, but the room can be used after replacement. The room facilities are relatively simple. There is a certain gap between the four-shaped standard. The specific manifestation is: old furniture, no necessary office appliances. The bed is not generally hard, and there are obvious stains. 2, The service attitude problem. When arriving at the hotel, the doorman has no sense of service. Not only does not help guests with luggage, but also has no sense of opening the door. The switchboard operator not only does not use bilingual, but also does not even have basic polite language. 3. Security issues: the hotel's fire safety awareness is not high enough. First of all, the hotel room The installation of sockets and power buttons is unstable, and some places are obviously loose. Secondly, carpets are laid in the aisle of the safety exit of the hotel on the 3rd and 4th floors. According to the content of the fire protection law, the aisle of the hotel’s safety exit cannot be laid. The carpet. The security guards are not doing their duty. 4. Food and beverage issues. There is no fruit for breakfast in the hotel. This is something I have never encountered before staying in a hotel. If there is no, there will be no, but the hotel is original and put plastic fruits on the dining table. The hotel is investigating the guest’s IQ or staff errors. The above is the feeling of staying at this hotel, but this hotel is not out of place, there is a light rail at the door of the hotel, the traffic is fairly convenient, it is close to the airport, a receptionist at the front desk and The computer engineer is worthy of praise. If you do not pursue enjoyment, if you can tolerate the days without internet, if you can not make higher demands on the quality of hotel service, if you can guarantee that you will stay in the hotel, there will be no fire in the hotel. I recommend you Check into this hotel. 
1	The geographical location is still very convenient for people on business trips, so easy to find. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, I like the texture of the shell very much, it is not painted, and the painted surface is easy to flower. 
0	It has been less than a week since I bought it, and now the price has dropped by 300. I bought it at 5799. It's disgusting. 
0	The wireless signal is not very good. The signal is on average 2-3 blocks lower than my HP notebook. After upgrading the driver and fine-tuning the parameters of the network card properties, the signal is still 1-2 frames lower than the HP notebook wireless without any optimization. There is no Express expansion slot. Several keys of the keyboard are not flexible, and the arrow keys are too small and inconvenient. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, very close to the railway station. I always feel that the hotel is cost-effective, the room is not very big, but it is also a very good choice for business trips. 
1	I booked a superior room, because I don’t smoke, I was fortunate to upgrade to the 18th floor of the administration building. The room is large and the service staff are very friendly. It is much better than the Kowloon Hotel (the room is small and the service staff did not smile). I will come to live in Imperial Palace next time. 
0	Please stop introducing this hotel which is a quasi-four-star unlisted hotel. It is best not to cooperate with this hotel again, which will damage your company's reputation. Not as good as a good guest house, only superficial skills, very noisy location, next to the highway, poor service, the entire hotel is dirty, bed sheets, pillowcases, carpets. . . I can only sleep in my clothes, the air-conditioning becomes heated in the middle of the night, it will heat you to death, the bathroom is dirty, and I dare not take a bath. Unable to eat breakfast, dirty dishes and poor food. A travel agency in the hotel is also very informal. I left immediately the next day and was in a bad mood. Additional comments October 8, 2007: Of course the waiters are also very poor 
0	The operating system is really bad and it doesn't cost much to add a windows? Suggest to increase the service of installing the system 
1	To be happy, I bought a second white. This white is quiet and doesn't like to be called. It has a beautiful skin and has to be wiped frequently. It is also compact and has a good design sense. Although it is small, it can fit everything. Loaded a lot of things, not slow at all 
0	As a popular book with a reputation, it is about foreign companies in Guangzhou. It should be similar to my living environment. But at a glance, it was a far cry. Forget it, I also found that many of the rules have a strong corporate personality, that is to say, they are just examples, not routines. Just show us these old fried dough sticks. If you look at the freshman who yearns for or wants to know more about foreign companies, it is really easy to mislead them. 
0	The soundproofing of the room is too poor! The room I booked faces the inner street, and the sound of the intercom and the air conditioner are very loud! It is recommended to install double-glazed windows! 
0	Hu is just showing off the words. Although the description is extraordinary, I always feel that there is no chapter. Zhang Mishang can take a look. Identification is completed. 
0	I checked in on September 19th and originally booked for 3 days on Ctrip. However, when I checked in, the front desk of the hotel did not ask me to stay for a few days and issued a one-day ticket to me. I was very angry at the time. I didn't care about it, so I moved in and left on the 22nd. In the end, Ctrip informed me that I had only completed one day of check-in and only gave me 1 day of points. depressed! On the night of check-in, the hotel joined a team and played mahjong over 3 o'clock, making it hard to sleep. And the location of the hotel is in Zhangjiajie Forest Park, it is not very convenient to visit Wulingyuan Scenic Area. 
1	Good value for money, good sound effect, good camera effect, and the price is not much different from Zhongguancun, I knew I didn’t buy it on Jingdong. 
1	"Black back, why does such a person exist in the world! Humorous satire, a completely different comic style. There is also a ""childhood story"" about whether he is true or not. The word ""influence"" appears most in this book, accompanied by a black back with a murderous expression. It is a must to burst into laughter. It is absolutely inevitable to read it in one breath. The admiration and admiration for black back comes with the surging river. The description is not enough. Don't provoke black back to anyone. But it is too late, I have been probated. . . Learned a lot. From now on friends, please be careful with me! ~ "
0	The content is fair, but in terms of literary talent, it's just so-so. It's just some great truths, but it still gives people some enlightenment. But this book is more suitable for girls with ideals 
0	High heat ~ It will be hot even after the game is on. A radiator is needed, especially in summer. The graphics card is entry-level. But adding the memory to 4G in the future will make it cooler. 
0	The book is basically the living environment in Japan, and there is still some difference from the country. Maybe I haven't lived alone, so there is no resonance. I put the book aside before I finished it... Fortunately, I bought a copy of hers. book 
1	The shell is very characteristic, the stripes are nice and it is good to use, it is easy to install XP according to the online saying, and there is an original mouse 
0	I don’t have a bag. I bought it again, but there’s nowhere to put the adapter. I’m depressed, but the computer is great. I’ll buy a bag later. It’s better if the battery is longer 
0	I thought it was a book for children. Even if some parents educate their parents how to read to their children, it’s not bad. I didn’t expect it to be a preaching book. Unfortunately, I will understand the intention of the introduction shopping guide next time. I don’t know if I can return it. ? ? ? 
1	Overall is acceptable. There are many advantages. I won’t mention the shortcomings. The shortcomings are listed as follows. I hope to improve: 1. There are abnormal noises in the room at night. Like the sound of water droplets or airflow. 2. Broadband can be used only when the service desk is activated. I don’t understand, it’s delayed a lot of things. 3, the quilt feels very bad, airtight, like a plastic cover, uncomfortable (personal feeling). 4, the floor lamp socket is out of power. I had to lie under the table and look for the one behind the table Socket. 5, the soundproofing of the bathroom is not bad. 
1	After receiving the book, I was attracted by the bright colors and layout of the cover before it was opened. I can’t wait to open it. The design and color pictures in the book are also good. The color and printing quality are good, and there is no taste. From simple to deep. The price is not expensive. I take it home, and the little baby likes it very much. My baby is only 2 years and 5 months old and it is not easy to tear her patch. I want to tear the larger patch for her. However, when I play again today, the tear is much better than yesterday, and she can exercise her small hands. When these books are used up, I think I will buy her some similar books again. 
0	The price is low and feels very expensive. The choice of hotels is mainly closer to nearby businesses. The room can always hear the sound of water very loudly. Hope the hotel can lower the price. The current facilities are only worth 250 yuan compared with other hotels in Anhui Province. 
1	Economics itself is a way of thinking. This book repeatedly emphasizes that the starting point of economic research is human individual behavior, and it is relative. It must have the relative object of behavior and the relative variability of environmental conditions. I have only watched part of it so far, but I feel the benefit. It is never too late to reconstruct this kind of brainwashing thinking. Example: The book says that in fact all choices are individual behaviors, not organizational behaviors. This sentence inspired me deeply. It really is the enlightenment of thinking. 
0	I ordered the book interior design on March 24, but what you sent me was landscape design. I made N phone calls after March 26, asking for a refund. You always say that you can buy it. You can handle it for me within 2 working days. I'll wait. It's been several 2 working days. Hope for the stars. , Hope for the moon, finally on April 1st, Pan came, but change, not retreat. So I called again, you said that 2 working days, I waited several 2 working days, there is still no news, I have to complain. Soon I received a call, telling me the exact time to refund within 1 working day, which is really good. , Without a trace of hesitation. But this working day is over again, how about people, phone calls? You guys are teasing me. It’s only 86.2 yuan. As for letting you do this, it’s not annoying? 
1	"I've watched ""Song of the Heart"", ""Da Mo Yao"", ""Secrets Buried by Time"", and look forward to ""Song in the Clouds"". Tong Hua's works have irresistible charm. I like her writing and look forward to her more good works coming out. "
0	It feels so-so. If you are traveling, it is far from the downtown area, which is a bit inconvenient. It's the floor instead of the carpet that I like. Broadband requires an extra charge, but digital TV can make up for it. The guest room is very simple, the furniture is a bit small, it feels not atmospheric enough, the funny thing is that there is no socket in the bathroom. . . . The room near the road is very noisy, although it has double windows, it is not quiet enough. Supplementary review May 4, 2007: The above review is a review of other hotels, it is wrong~~~~~~~~~ Add: The location is in the downtown area, it is very convenient to go shopping, the room is not only the floor, Others have been there, broadband charges are uncomfortable, breakfast is average, but the taste of fish balls is OK 
0	When shopping, they are still in stock. In the end, it informed me that it was out of stock. Dangdang's service attitude really needs to be improved. 
1	Fast delivery speed~ASUS notebook quality is still quite good~The price is good~The driver under XP is still very well installed~The appearance is also OK~ 
0	If you don't buy it, you don't need to buy it. It's enough to take a look at the Sina online reading channel. Doctor Bi's writing technique is too old, and he is not suitable for writing similar things for those who are too old-are they still yelling at the discovery of lesbians? Is there a story in this book that is beyond imagination and makes people clap and wonder? Can't stand it. . . 
0	Don't live in this place, with an embroidered pillow. It looks good. Nothing else. If you don't turn on the air conditioner in cold weather, they say that they don't think it is necessary to turn on. You are so angry that you will die. I moved on the second day, 
1	"It is sold by Confucius. Note that it is the August 1980 edition. The cover says ""Editor-in-Chief Ren Yingqiu"", and the writing instructions say ""Personal writing, collective review"". It seems that the editor-in-chief of the 1986 edition was not the old man. He passed away in 1984. "
0	It's just that the disk partitioning is troublesome at the beginning, it's a bit hot, and there are too few USB ports. Why can't the built-in office be used, so should I buy the copyright? 
1	I have lived here for half a month. Our party lived in 5 rooms, including deluxe suites and deluxe standard rooms. I feel that the hotel's service is good, and all the people in the hotel have a good attitude! The luxurious suites can see the river and the entire Yangtze River. It is best to book a suite with a ending number of 18. The hotel’s breakfast is average~, I rented a bicycle in Jiujiang, and there is a hotel. The manager took special care of this, but felt that the price in Jiujiang has no advantage. Although it is 4 stars, the facilities are actually less than 4 stars. The hotel’s gym is basically just furnishings, and it also charges. Did not disturb the call. The air conditioner is not good at night, and I wake up frequently! Yuanzhou is the same! Hotel Feedback April 17, 2008: You know the hotel well, thank you for your support! 
0	Look at the specifications before buying it. It is a 6-cell battery, but the actual product is a 3-cell. This is a big shortcoming. I hope that Jingdong can organize the supply of original 6-cell batteries. 
0	1. There is a problem with the communication or process with Ctrip. I clearly booked, but the hotel replied after inquiring that I did not book and did not receive a fax from Ctrip. 2. I finally checked into the hotel, but instead of the double bed I ordered, I gave me a big bed. Contact the main station, there is no twin room, I want to add money to live in a deluxe room. I didn't agree, and later gave me a double bed standard room, but lied to me that it was a deluxe room. 3. A lady surnamed Chen has a very poor service attitude, possibly a hall manager. The attitude of the receptionist is still very good. I have stayed at this hotel several times, but after this time, I will never stay at this hotel again. Including my friends, I would not recommend them to go in. 
0	I feel that the content is very empty, and I don’t know if my understanding is not good, I didn’t understand it, or if it is really unclear or unclear! 
0	The pre-installed linux does not directly enter the system, so it is not convenient to test the machine. The CD-ROM is all in English, and the manual does not specify the detailed hardware. It is troublesome to install the driver. LED screen is not as good as Lenovo's, Lenovo's may be adjusted to the darkest, Acer's not. 
0	Even with the addition of 1G memory, Vista is still a bit slow compared to desktop + XP, and several old versions of software need to be reorganized. 
0	1.) I booked a super deluxe standard room of 330, there is a computer in the room, but the daily Internet charge is 50 yuan. There is no free bottled water in the room. 2.) For the first time, I gave a room without a view, and opened the window to see the bottom The glass roof of the restaurant on the building strongly requested a room change. Then I switched to one room. As a result, there were two large water tanks outside the window. I don’t know if the rooms booked on CTRIP are like this. 3.) The air conditioning in the room sometimes suddenly does not cool. .)Yangshuo is beautiful, will go again, but will definitely change hotels. 
0	"The location is at the 4th crossroads and there is a viaduct (there are few cars on the viaduct and there are motorcycles!) Anji has many modified three-wheeled ""cars"" that make the sound of tractors. Of course, do not choose the room near the road. The interior decoration can be regarded as the first in Anji, but I strongly despise the induction ventilator in the bathroom. Every time I go in, I make the sound of a rural exhaust fan. The second time I sense the presence of people, I immediately increase my horsepower. Sometimes it will automatically exhaust air, it is estimated that the quality of the sensor used. I live in the inner third floor room, the second floor below is connected to the kitchen, 6 exhaust fans make me amazed! ! Fortunately, the hotel restaurant is 8; it closes at 30pm. But during the day it is really noisy, so I can only turn on the TV to resist. Conclusion There is a big problem with the decoration layout of this hotel. The hotel staff should look at how other people's hotels maintain the quiet power of guests. In addition, there are harassing calls, and it is estimated that every guest can receive two or three calls. Meals: Vegetables are cheap, buy one get one free, and enough. But there are too many monosodium glutamate recipes, and you are very particular about it, so you must explain in advance. "
0	Why install vista...not used to it...too many pre-installed things (most of them are trial)...the white keyboard is easy to get dirty 
0	The text is boring, non-artistic, and difficult to catch the eye. Turning a page, OVER! The ancients said: No book is worse than nothing! Here I would like to say: It is better to believe in advertising than no advertising! 
0	Order 184477629, why is it out of the warehouse at 14:43:34 2007-7-11, there is no information until 15:30 on July 21st today? Is Dangdang's promised 5-6 days delivery slogan true? Why is there no way to explain when calling the maintenance hotline? Does Dangdang have no knowledge of its own logistics and delivery status? Is there a commitment to customers? Is there a solution to customer complaints? This is my second order. The first order number is 162957864. It took more than 20 days to receive the book. How many days will it take this time? The last time I said people did not go to work during the Spring Festival, what about this time? What reason? Can anyone answer me, where is my book and why is it like this? 
1	The environment is very good! Very quiet! Old facilities! The restaurant dishes are very good! Hope to improve the hardware facilities! 
0	Apart from the location close to the subway, few other advantages have been found. The room smells bad and the bathroom has stains. The most unbearable thing is the phone and the Internet: the phone is a weird busy tone when you pick it up, you have to dial seven or eight times in a row to get through once, I asked the front desk, and answered that there is indeed a problem of poor contact. Just bear it! I told the front desk in person that I want to open the network (although the charge is 20 yuan/day). The answer is: No problem, this is activated, and the IP address is automatically assigned, without manual setting. After returning to the room, I found that there was no local connection. After contacting the front desk, there was a local connection. But I can’t open the webpage after trying for a long time, and then contact the front desk (it’s almost collapsed!), the waiter came over ten minutes later and randomly pointed me to delete the company’s IP address (just a backup setting, not the default connection, there is no need to delete it) , And then changed the automatically obtained IP of the default connection to their manual address. Completely fainted,,,,,,,, I will never dare to stay in such a hotel anymore, please also Ctrip to be more responsible for users! 
1	Although the content of the book is far from my real life. But the author's brushwork is very delicate. It made me burst into tears, although I was met with strange eyes from colleagues in the office. But I still can't help it, hoping that lovers will eventually get married. More joy and happiness, less sorrow and misfortune. Through this book, I realized that women should let their lives be in their own hands, not men or others to plan their own life trajectory. Regardless of Suheng or Ling Jun, their lives are actually sad, although Ling Jun's final ending is good. 
0	The price of the room is very expensive, the Internet fee is 2 yuan per minute, and all prices are subject to service charges. The room facilities are average and the TV signal is intermittent. The concierge is the worst. The free airport bus seems to be a reward for the guests. I feel very uncomfortable after sitting. I will never go to this hotel in the future, and other Ramadas are also waived. 
0	The keyboard gap is big and gray, and the system will not install it by itself~~The screen is a bit narrow and the characters in the game are a bit deformed 
1	I read this book 20 years ago and listened to the serial broadcast of the novel. I liked it very much, but at that time I was borrowing a book from the library. The conditions were limited and I didn't buy a copy. I got the book yesterday and looked on the sofa after dinner. Later I went to bed and kept seeing it after 2 o'clock before I put it down to sleep. The masterpiece gives people a feeling of when to read, which makes people feel refreshed. Often reading is always new. Let our impetuous hearts become clear, at least at a certain time, we are no longer lost and wandering, it is never too late for good things. 
0	If you go to Chengdu, live here is good, the itinerary is convenient, and other things are very poor. The most annoying is to invite guests to dinner and settle the bill. After a long time, I went to the room and said that the tablecloth was burned, and I just had to pay 500. 
1	"When I first got the book, it felt ordinary, because its appearance was so simple; when I first opened the first two pages, it felt so ordinary, because the language used by Mr. He was plain and ""quaint"", which made people I feel that this book is readable or not. When I started on the third page, I felt that I couldn’t let go of this book. This is a book that fascinates me so much. After reading a part of it every day, I will tell it to my husband and son during dinner. The whole family likes it. I especially like what Mr. He said about his experiences and feelings when he was studying at Southwest United University, which benefited me a lot. A good book naturally has a good reputation! "
0	"I don’t like to write a book like this, and then spend my time reading it! I think this kind of language is more suitable to blow on the CCTV ""Hundreds of Forums""~~~ I think history should be a little more serious~~~ "
1	The appearance is very beautiful, although it is T, it is not slower than P CPU. The heat dissipation is still good. The equipped remote control is very fun, thin and easy to control when watching movies. 
1	The workmanship is good, the breathing light on the middle roller and the floating keyboard are highlights. The price/performance ratio of 45 is not mentioned in Sony's books. 
1	Configuration moderation, same configuration and same grade, lowest price. Satisfying general work, study, and games is enough. A row of touch switches feels pretty cool. The display screen can really be used as a mirror, I don't know if it is an advantage or a disadvantage. 
1	SSD hard disk, metal casing, complete functions (including built-in microphone, this is not introduced). 
0	"""Odd Books"" are not considered to be! Just looking at the results, success is good, but not everything has to be said. . . "
1	The decoration of the hotel is a bit old, and the elevators are the oldest. But the room should have been renovated, it is larger and cleaner. The location is excellent, very close to the bus terminal, and it is convenient to have Xinyijia opposite. 
0	There was a musty smell as soon as I entered the room. Later I found that the toilet tank could not get water. I asked the waiter to repair it twice. I was still not at ease. I was also dissatisfied with the attitude of the waiter. So I asked to change the room on another floor at the front desk. The changed room may have been unoccupied for a long time. The drain gave off a strong smell, which was really uncomfortable. Fortunately, the waiter on this floor washed the bathroom with water very seriously. At night, we After taking a shower, I found that water was leaking from the wooden floor in front of the bed. Relative to such a charge but such a quality, I really had nothing to say. 
1	"In fact, I still like the original name: ""Simple Flowering"". We are all ordinary people. Although simple, we will have our own happy character. The heroine Su Yihao is independent and strong. She is more traditional in the concept of marriage. I like it very much and the relationship between Su Yihao and Chen Mingran is very real. From this we can see the blind spots and difficulties in our feelings. The author is a very careful person. From her first work ""Hua Fa Hua Can Hong Qing Xing Xiao ""Until ""If I Meet You in the Next Second"", I have been chasing after Jinjiang, hoping that Nan Shi will be able to publish such a beautiful book in the future "
0	The novel has been read a long time ago. I bought it only for collection. The hateful thing is that Dangdang didn't wrap this book in a plastic bag. 
1	"September 11, 2007 256 yuan to live in a standard room, facing the street (other room types are no longer available). I like to sleep with the window open, overall it feels not too noisy. Because the Yuhuangge North Street below is not the main traffic artery in Yinchuan. There was some traffic in the morning. There is a farmer’s market opposite, it is very convenient to buy seasonal fruits. Not far from the Drum Tower, you can taste ""Lao Mao catching meat"". "
0	The hotel is too old, the lobby feels like a three-star, and the rooms are in a better three-star condition. In a hotel like Qingdao, it is definitely not a four-star standard. The breakfast was not found after two laps. , Too bad 
1	The appearance is simple and beautiful, and the weight is relatively light. With the configuration, it is definitely enough for college students. The heat dissipation is also better than my own hp. 
0	It's just a resort at best, the rooms are actually not big, I don't know how to get 4 stars. The hotel is adjacent to the 104 National Highway and is an accessory facility for the sale of villas. The decoration of the rooms smells great, and one of the houses has no windows. The bathroom smells bad, and the facilities are not as good as a 3-star hotel. If it's not too late to go to Shandong Road, how can I not come to this hotel. 
0	At first, I didn't intend to see an interview with Dan on TV, so I bought her book hopefully. After watching it, I feel far away from the lecture on TV! Disappointed! 
1	Appearance, configuration, price, the combination of the three is absolutely value-for-money stuff. I started with 4699 and grabbed it. 
1	After posting it, I bought another set for the mother in the community. Most recommended 
1	The screen is big and the books are thin. Comes with a numeric keypad, which is relatively rare. The sound is passable. There are many usb interfaces, there are four. It's good to watch HD by itself. The running speed is also OK, cost-effective! 
0	There were almost no lights in the underground garage, and there was muddy water. When I got off the car, I stepped on the muddy water. The so-called sea-view room can’t see the sea, don’t say, it’s critically noisy, and in the middle of the night I was awakened by street vendors and tractors and couldn’t sleep anymore. There are nuisance calls and broadband Internet access is not available. No bathtub, no shower cap, no slippers. The lady at the front desk was holding the phone and chatting with her boyfriend while leaving the guests aside. It is recommended that Ctrip cancel the cooperation with this company. 
1	As a five-star hotel, the hardware is poor, the decoration is long, the TV is small, but the location is good, downstairs is DFS opposite to Harbour City, but the price is not high 
0	It's better not to go, it's very bad, I want to change the hotel after reading it very bad, they actually asked me for the service fee. They didn't stay in the room for 2 minutes, and it solved the problem. I think I can't go next time. 
0	"I couldn’t stand it after I watched half of it. In the second half, I hesitated a few times and let go of the passion that I didn’t continue watching. The story was so plain that there was no ups and downs. I learned that little thing in the workplace too vaguely, without specific description, and Du Lala is just an administration. It is an unskilled job that can be described by an individual. It is really embarrassing to have such a technical content. The author originally bought it for the best-selling ranking first. I think it will not affect most people. Have no taste, right? It turns out that this cruel fact is a ""bestseller"" that makes people chew the wax... "
1	The hotel environment is very good, but the traffic is not very convenient. You need to reach the car everywhere. The key is that it is not easy to get to the hotel. 
1	The price is moderate in this area, there are breakfast shops, small restaurants nearby, more convenient, no breakfast and no place 
1	The location of the hotel is good, close to shopping centers and office areas. I've always lived in Dalian before, but it feels old. During the stay, the hotel is undergoing renovation, refurbishment and upgrading of room equipment. Fortunately, I hope that house prices will not rise too much by then. 
0	The location is not very convenient, the surroundings are noisy, and the sanitary conditions are not as good as other home-like stores. I will never live here again. 
0	I bought it with a lot of interest. I bought it with a rough copy and the layout is very good. My sister said to look at it. If it is good, I will also buy one. But I really watched it, it's really not very good. I just turned two pages of English words in Chinese and I didn't want to force myself. What I want to say is that practicing English vocabulary will definitely not be effective by relying on this book. Other good methods are much better than this. 
1	It’s good, but some people don’t like mirrored ones. I personally like them better. Anyway, I’m satisfied. 
1	The room is nice, but the internet speed is unbearably slow. It takes half an hour to open a webpage and can't even receive email. Another front desk staff service attitude is very good, but efficiency has improved. 
0	Very disappointed, it is better to buy a collection of Zhang Ailing's essays, named after <Lust Ring>, but this article is only more than 10 pages, and has no head and tail, which is completely inferior to any other article in it.

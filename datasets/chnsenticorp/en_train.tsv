1	The reason for choosing Pearl River Garden is its convenience. There are escalators to reach the seaside directly, and there are restaurants, food corridors, shopping malls, supermarkets, and stalls all around. The decoration of the hotel is average, but fairly tidy. The swimming pool is on the roof of the lobby, so it is very small, but my daughter likes it. The included breakfast is western style, which is quite rich. Service? average 
1	The keyboard of the 15.4-inch notebook is really cool. It's almost the same as the desktop computer. I like the numeric keypad. It is very convenient to input numbers, looks very beautiful, and the workmanship is quite good. 
0	The room is too small. Others are general. . . . . . . . . 
0	1. It hasn't been a few minutes after the power is connected, and the power adapter is not hot. 2. The camera cannot be used. 3. The piano paint of the cover cannot be touched by hands, and one touch is printed. 4. Hard disk partitioning is difficult to handle. 
1	I only learned today that this book still has a sixth volume. I am a bit depressed: Why are there two versions of the same set of books? Should Dangdang discuss with the publisher and publish a separate volume 6 so that our children will not have it. Sorry. 
0	Some label appeared to be torn on the back of the machine, and the residual glue was still there. But I can’t see what the label is missing. It’s all there, blame 
0	Hehe, although the skin looks good and delicate, I can still tell it is stolen. But the content inside is really good, my mother loves to read it, and I also learned to find acupuncture points. 
0	This book is really bad. I used to hear from Zhejiang University's teachers how this book is wrong, and I still don’t believe it. I finally bought a copy and found it really~~~ speechless, this kind of book Can be written 
1	Good location, in the city center. The hotel has good service and rich breakfast. The computer broadband speed in the business digital room I live in is satisfactory, and the room is fairly clean, close to Hunan Road Snack Street. 
1	I stayed here during 5.1. The location is OK. Near the municipal party committee and government, I have to take a taxi to the commercial area and pedestrian street. There are mosquitoes in the house. Although the space is quite large, closing the curtains after turning off the lights at night is almost impossible to reach. Good for sleeping, but will be woken up by damn mosquitoes! Two were killed, and they were found the next morning. The bathroom was quite large, but the equipment was very old. 
0	I've seen it from a friend, but the book I ordered hasn't arrived for half a month. I haven't received a call and it's useless. You must think about it in the future! Dangdang is too slow 
1	Not bad, facilities are a bit old but acceptable, but the price of 606 does not include breakfast a bit high. The mall and supermarket downstairs are very convenient. Will choose this next time. 
1	Lightweight, easy to carry, and good performance, it can meet the usual work needs, very good for business travelers 
1	I stayed in a luxury sea view room in the resort. The front desk gave it to the 5th floor (the highest 6th floor), and then almost 100% sea view. Although it is listed with 5 stars, I think it is a 4-star standard, and I later stayed in 5 Star Sheraton is quite a bit different, but overall it is still in line with his price. 
0	1. The mold has a camera position, but there is no camera. 2. General workmanship. 3. Both the manual and driver are in electronic version. 4. There is no pre-installed XP system. 
0	The inner bag provided was a bit bad, and the middle connection of the external power supply could not be fully inserted. The battery life is not as long as the nominal one. I hope Jingdong will pay attention to the authenticity of the promotion. 
1	This is the first time I have given all five stars ^_^ Super fast! This is the fastest time I received the book. I ordered it at noon, and I received it in the morning on the second day. Forget it, 1 day The time has not come yet! Here, I am grateful for the service of Dangdang... I really need this book urgently. About the book itself, it is also very good. The content is still very rich, it is worth recommending, for training and It is helpful to cultivate logical thinking styles, and I recommend it~ and I wish my friends all successful interviews, hahaha~ 
0	Very good location, messy service, sluggish hotel. 
1	Beautiful (wife thinks), high cost performance. The battery is great, it can be used for 4-6 hours, and the compatibility is okay. I reinstalled WIN7 directly when I got it. Basically, I don’t need any drivers except for shortcut keys. 
0	"The memory is too small, and it is equipped with 2 ""gold bars"", which is currently compatible. But I don't know if the memory is incompatible or what, sometimes I hear the sound of the hard drive ""clicking"". Office under the preset system is a trial version of 2007. Even if you install 2003, the Genuine Value Added Program window will pop up every time you start it, which is very troublesome! "
1	Very good, good service, located in the downtown area, convenient transportation, but the price is high! 
1	"My two-year-old son likes cars, especially trains, so I bought a set on the recommendation of a friend. Unexpectedly, the children like it very much, especially the first book, ""Lun Lun Lun Zhuan"", every day before going to bed, I have to hold the book to the bed to read. He would keep asking me ""What car is this?"" and ""What car is this?"". The first book has now been turned over. When walking on the road and seeing the car, he would be very excited to tell me ""Mom, cement mixer truck!"". The various cars in the book give children a lot of room for imagination, and this is the first time I bought a book on Dangdang and it was very successful. Yes, I will come next time. "
0	"The last few pages of the book are actually ""double eyelids"". All the words are printed twice, so I can't read them at all. The quality of the book is really bad. "
0	Some things don’t agree with, a shortcut after the fact, but in this case, what young people should experience is still to experience, otherwise they will abandon it after possessing it, because it was not his own choice, so this book is said to be misleading 
0	I went to the official website and downloaded the latest XP driver. The sound card was installed and there was sound. Then I installed the graphics card. After the graphics card was installed, the computer no longer sounded. I installed the graphics card and sound card drivers for the third time. Conflict, then downloaded the previous graphics card driver on the official website, and finally got it done, no conflict 
1	It was given to me by a friend, and now I am recommending it to other friends. It opened a door for me, the door to the palace of the picture book. Even me, the so-called educator, must lament my ignorance. Thank the author for telling us that there are so many good picture books in the world. The picture books I bought for Xiaoxiao were bought in this way, and she couldn't put it down! Of course, now I have discovered another magical effect: saving money. Haha, just imagine, how much does it cost to buy all the books in there? Hey, I am not a fool. It’s not bad to tell the story like this. 
0	It is not much different from staying in a guest house. Will never stay in the hotel for the second time! 
0	It was terribly bad, a lot of musty smell, barely stayed for one night, and hurry up early the next day 
0	1. I have been on the Internet for a long time, but I can’t get there. I asked the hotel and the answer was broken. Angry! 2. Checking in at night happened when the weather changed. The weather became cold. After turning on the air conditioner for a long time, it was still cold. Ask the hotel, and the answer was to turn off the air conditioner at night. gosh! There was only one quilt on the bed, and I looked for quilts everywhere, none. I asked the hotel to call me three times in half an hour. It was still cold, and asked for an extra quilt. The waiter never returned after he went. He called the reception desk and waited for a long time, but the quilt was gone. Don't treat customers as human beings. 3. I didn't sleep in the whole night, and was awakened by a low roar that didn't know where it came from at 5 o'clock in the morning. After searching the room for a long time, I didn't find out where the sound was coming from, and called the waiter. The waiter came after six o'clock, and it couldn't be solved. Just stayed up all night. Buying gas is accepted. 4. I went to the main station and asked the manager on duty to explain. I changed a few people and said it several times. The hotel continued to implement the truth of the matter. Finally, a self-proclaimed customer service manager came and said something happened. He apologized and did something. After hours of cold bench, I didn't drink any hot water and my mouth was dry. This is their sincerity. Summary: The hardware is old and the service is poor. 
1	"On the day I took it home, my daughter asked me to tell her 6 stories as soon as possible! I'm exhausted. Because there was the first set of ""magic school bus"", the little guys liked it very much. However, I personally think that this set is not as good-looking as the first set. The characters are drawn a little bit differently from the first set. Sometimes the story is not connected and it feels like it is not a genuine version or a version translated at a time. In short, there is no good-looking first set. For 5-year-olds, the content is a bit deep and not attractive enough for the first set. But overall it's still very good, maybe it's different if you read it a bit bigger? "
0	There is no worse hotel than this. The room lighting is dim, the air conditioning cannot be adjusted, and the front desk service is rigid. At breakfast, the waiter actually told me to go back to my room and replace my slippers with leather shoes. Who is the god? The boss of this hotel should resign immediately. It is recommended that you do not live in this hotel because you feel cheated! 
0	The language is relaxed and humorous, it makes people feel good when reading, and the content is practical, but I don’t like to copy all the blog replies and interaction topics with readers. It feels messy. 
1	The quality and service of acer are very good, and this product is very good value. The look is also pretty, and the basic performance can handle it as long as you don't play big games. 
0	Do not buy if you are not a computer expert. There is no windows system, and there are many restrictions on the motherboard and bios, which make it impossible to install windows smoothly. 
0	My baby is almost two years old. This set of books is too simple and unattractive for her. I bought it after reading everyone's reviews, which is not ideal. 
1	It seems that I have read all of Tonghua’s books. I like them all. They are so nervous and depressing. I don’t want to put them down every time I read them. This time, I finished reading 3 books in a few nights, and they all got to 12 Too much is not enough. I have to get up early in the morning to go to work and I can only sleep. The plot is very attractive. I don't know if this is a good ending for Yunge, but in my opinion, the ending is quite perfect. Although it is not a happy reunion, at least it is in line with human psychology! Regarding the love between Liu Fulin and Yunge, I even cried a few times in the middle, the poor person (but nothing to hate)... I like it~ it's worth seeing 
1	I live in a special standard room. The so-called special features are somewhat like home. The bedding is not monotonous white, but stripes and large lattices, it feels very warm. The cushion of the chair is a cartoon Garfield head. The bright yellow color is a bit garish, and it feels a bit inconsistent with the surrounding. 3.5 points for guest room hardware evaluation. Humidifier, ironing board, electric iron, hair dryer, small refrigerator, etc. are all available. Disadvantages: The LCD TV is fixed on the wall and the position is not good. One is blocking a power socket; the other is improper matching with the table. The table (integrated with the refrigerator cabinet) is under the TV. If you sit at the table to surf the Internet or work or study, it just blocks the TV screen. Sitting staggered, it happened to be the refrigerator cabinet, and the legs could not stretch out. 
1	I am a beginner in French, and I have taken a 78-hour elementary class. Because I am an elderly and French is difficult, I have to learn from scratch and consolidate it again, and then prepare to enroll in the intermediate class. The textbooks we learn are teachers Sun Hui. Buy The answers to this exercise are very necessary for self-study and to check the correctness of the exercises. And the teaching materials of Sun Hui have videos on the Internet, which are very helpful for us to learn French. The teaching materials of Sun Hui are very well written. Recommend to friends who learn French. I think that after I have studied the booklets, combined with the reading and study (traveling throughout France), we will achieve our expectations. This is just a personal opinion. 
1	The room is small, but quite clean, and the air-conditioning is noisy, and sleeping at night is still a bit noisy. The breakfast is a buffet, very rich! Overall it feels good! 
0	The price can go down a bit (the price of Hong Kong Bank is dual battery + inner package + xp), the 3-cell battery is a bit small, and the 1g memory is a bit small. The most important thing is that the resolution is 1024*576, which is a bit annoying 
1	This YMCA is very good, and also took the initiative to help us upgrade our rooms. It is great and comfortable, the location is also very convenient, and the service is good. It is known as the first-rate YMCA in Hong Kong with good quality and price. 
1	The LED screen is cool, the basic hardware configuration is very balanced, the mirror finish is good, and I like it. 
0	When I open this book, it reminds me of the tepid Korean women in Korean dramas. Maybe this is a cultural difference. 
0	Broken hotel Internet is slow and confused. The network card has a connection speed of only 10M. What age is it? Also use such a slow switch. There will be a horrible breakfast. There is nothing to eat. Can't even wait to fry an egg. Their foreman is still in the frying shop. While frying and eating. The fruit is not so delicious. After staying a few times, I didn't get any fruit. . 
1	I hope everyone can try to stay in every hotel like me, because every hotel has its own characteristics 
0	The book actually doesn’t say anything, and I don’t see where the value is. The author is a cow. He criticizes western medicine for nothing, and I feel that he doesn’t understand science 
1	Not bad, you can live there, and I suggest you live in a higher-level room 
1	I am reading this so sad novel all the time. I love dogs like that, and I have always hoped that I can raise a dog. I also observe some cute dogs around me every day. The conditions at home have never talked about my wish. When I saw the introduction of the author and the article, I couldn't help it. I strongly urged my parents to buy it for me. A partner like a dog gives people happiness, joy and happiness. And when I turned over the last page of this book, I couldn't help feeling unusually sad. At the same time, I admire the author and the dog, and bought the Golden Retriever... 
1	"I am not an extreme person, so I like all kinds of books. I will read both Han Han and Guo Jingming’s books. Guo Jingming’s writings are more sensational, and sometimes I think what he wrote is very unacceptable... But he is indeed brilliant... but Han Han The things written are very deep and connotative. I will read many of his books attentively without feeling boring... I am watching ""His Kingdom"", and I feel that he still maintains the text. His style...but still like it. Come on! I will always love your work, so Han Han, you have to work hard to write a book! "
0	I wanted to sell it to my friends as a textbook for introductory English, but I didn't expect the effect to be good. I was really not used to reading mixed with Chinese and English. Fortunately, I bought the first book. 
0	Carmela is a brave chick, simple and persistent, I like it~ my colleague’s baby also likes it~ and I will listen to my boyfriend and I am very devoted~ 
1	The hotel environment is very good, the business center is very welcoming. The free airport shuttle service is very good. The room facilities are acceptable, but the bathroom is in poor condition, there is no hair dryer, and hot water will be available after 7:30 am. And I always say that you can’t swipe your card when the line is busy, and you have to pay in cash for the room. 
1	It feels very strange. I obviously wrote two reviews for this set of books, but my Dangdang always reminds me to write reviews for this set! Dizzy! This is a very good set of books, so I don't need to write a few reviews! 
0	Is a book that teaches girls how to pursue material things, is it worthy of such pursuit by big guys? In this materialistic society, there are fewer and fewer people with spiritual pursuits~ 
1	"It was an accident to buy this book. After I got the book, I read it as soon as possible. It was unexpectedly wonderful. Regarding the trivialities of life, the description in the book is very subtle. But it is not trivial to make the story popular, and the positive things in the author's style are very moving. I like Deng Youzhen the most. Just like the word ""zhen"" in her name, she is really a very pleasing protagonist. The picture feels very good, probably because of the drama? In short, it's so fun, don't watch it when you drink water and eat... It's a pity that Qiao Rui still feels that the ink is not enough? Whisper... "
1	I booked the superior lady's room (twin bed), the room was clean and tidy, and the service was okay. The variety of breakfast is a bit small, but the taste is okay. Check out is fast. In general, my colleagues and I lived quite satisfied. 
0	The price is too high and the price/performance ratio is not good enough. I think it is better to go to other hotels in the future. 
0	"It's very easy to read. There are only a few pages in total. The original text of ""Zhuangzi"" occupies 53 pages, and the layout is sparse, so it is easy to handle. It feels to me that it is really simple to use Zhuangzi's reputation. Zhuangzi told a lot of stories and fables. This kind of originality is commendable, but Yu Dan's book is nothing new. I have not listened to her lectures. Maybe the body language will be vivid and intriguing. Anyway, just looking at the text, there are works better than her. "
1	When I went to YZ this year, I chose to stay at the New Century Hotel~ 4 stars, the basic impression is very good~ Close to Shouxihu, Geyuan, Heyuan, only about ten minutes by car, nearby banks, newspaper shops, restaurants, cake shops , Tea restaurant, and supermarket, it should be said that life is very convenient~ it is a good choice for tourist accommodation. The decoration of the hotel is not bad. When we went, we upgraded to a room on the 23rd floor for free. The room is relatively large, without the smell of smoke and oily smoke, It feels good~ I clean the room every day and help us put on new toiletries. It feels good~ The hotel has a socket converter, so I don’t need to bring it in the past~ There is broadband, free of charge :)~!~ 
1	I bought this notebook at the time because it was beautiful + battery, and there was no pursuit of a small notebook with performance. However, after upgrading to 2G memory + reinstalling Vista, it still feels good and more prudent. I went to Computer City to see other brands of netbooks. Later, even though this was more expensive at the time, I still started 
1	The big bed room is not bad, I haven't seen the others. The location is good. Hope the dishes are better 
1	I am very satisfied with the notebook and package for 1699 yuan, and the installation of XP is also smoother than expected. The appearance is beautiful and has a big factory style, and the keyboard is comfortable. 
1	The speed is very fast. I ordered the night before and arrived at noon the next day; the delivery staff was very good, from Shijingshan District; I am using it now, at most, I recommend the Lenovo model; Disadvantage: the shell is too smooth, Scratches are easy! The keyboard is too difficult to use, I was from Asus last, it's nothing to compare! 
0	The noise outside the room is too loud and noisy! It is more reasonable to book directly at the front desk. 
1	Seeing the evaluation and the introduction of the book, I like it myself. I bought three books because the book is very thick and contains a lot of text. I am worried that my daughter does not like it because she likes picture books. I took a book home first and planned to tell my child before going to bed, but my daughter who was in the first grade, after seeing the book, was out of control. I don't need to talk about it at all. After reading a book in one breath, I breathed a sigh of relief. I also asked if I had any other books. I sighed for the last war elephant in the book. I was sad that Buhayi was crushed by the elephants. Let me tell her again every day before going to bed. Until she fell asleep. 
0	The hotel is too old, not like 4 stars, the room soundproofing is too poor, playing mahjong next door, too noisy 
0	The sanitary conditions are relatively poor, really bad! The towel is white with black, and the toilet and the floor have been separated, and they will fall down when touched. There is no parking lot, and the car is not too safe on the side of the road 
0	I bought 7 copies in total. Most of the books are of poor quality and light, like pirated copies. I hope the administrator can indicate the quality of the paper. If I find this problem next time, I will return it. . 
0	I don’t know if it’s a translated book or other reasons. I feel that the whole book is always repeating around the same topic. 
1	It will be better to use the system after changing to XP. Why does Microsoft have to force manufacturers to install vista, a big guy who thinks it's cool? It would be better if there was a bag! 
0	Too mysterious, but not credible. It's been a month since I bought it for my parents, but it's still brand new, and I'm not interested at all. I saw that so many people sought after, and always suggested that they read it, but I read a few pages and threw it aside, exaggerating----- 
0	"""Lust, Caution"" is a book that sells dog meat. I originally bought it and prepared to read novels, but it turned out to be a collection of short stories. Online shopping is flawed, because we can't go to the book to buy, buy The reader should explain it as necessary and clear at a glance, even if you add a sentence? Short story collection?, the reader will not be so disappointed with the book, ah... "
0	It's not as good as I imagined. I thought it was a humorous and humorous book, so I could easily learn foreign languages. After reading it, I found that the content was just some common word spelling corrections, etc. It was boring. 
1	Staying in a mini standard room for 260 yuan. It feels much better than expected. The room is suitable for one person. The bathroom is large and clean. The quality of the bedding in the room is very good, as clean as new. The windows of the room are glass curtain walls and cannot be opened for ventilation. This is the closest hotel to Dalian Railway Station. The front desk service attitude is very good, very enthusiastic and skilled in business. When checking out, the rounds are relatively slow, and when there are many people, you have to wait a few more minutes. The overall feeling is ok, and the traffic is extremely convenient. 
1	The price-performance ratio is good, the appearance, feel and performance of the notebook are not bad, after all, it is something of a big brand. The delivery speed is fast, the order placed at noon the day before will be delivered the next afternoon. 
0	The memory is small, but I gave 1G, which is 2G. I still miss the XP system, but according to the situation, the pre-installed system vista is the general trend 
0	The shell is too thin and tender, and the plastic shell next to the display screen can be lifted up with a fingernail. It took 2 weeks and there were a lot of scratches. The wireless driver is not in the CD, and the people at Asus are lazier than me. A pin fell out of the keyboard and can't be taken out. . . 
0	There is a problem with the hotel’s air conditioning! Too many mosquitoes! I can’t sleep!!! The attitude of the waiter is not bad! 
0	It was very hot just after turning on the machine, as a 10-inch portable notebook, it is still a bit thicker or heavier because of the battery. Because of the increase in storage time, I can bear it~ 
0	The great leader Chairman Mao has long criticized the Confucianism and Mencius thoughts, and has poisoned the broad masses of people for thousands of years. Chairman Mao has made a well-known conclusion. It will not help the development of modern China at all. The Chinese should be completely discarded. 
1	The first impression is that the doorman service is in place, and the front desk service is also smiling. The rooms are relatively spacious and bright, and the internet speed is fast. Very satisfied hotel! 
1	The executive twin room booked through Ctrip (and paid in advance) ~ finally gave us father and daughter a double room ~ and repeatedly stated that there is no twin room ~ at my repeated request ~ in the end, although A twin room is provided~but the impression is greatly discounted~Additional review on March 24, 2008: Hot spring~98 guests per person~Small fish pond 46~additional charge~ 
1	I have been reading this book recently and I think it's good. At the beginning, I just wanted to see Nan Huaijin, but I didn't have the patience to buy a local copy. After all, Mr. Nan Huaijin's books were all about lectures, which were rather wordy. So I picked this book which contains various opinions of Mr. Nan Huaijin on Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. At the beginning, it was indeed directed at Nan Huaijin, but it is not anymore. The author's opinion is very concise and clear, which makes me easy to accept, and our views are consistent. Maybe this is not a book that people can read and read, but it is a book that makes people feel at first sight, that's enough. 
1	It’s pretty good to live in such a hotel in Quzhou. The LCD TV in the room, the window looks like a small river, and the fruit is delivered. It’s pretty good, but the surrounding environment is average, there’s nothing to visit... 
1	Although it is an old hotel, the equipment is quite complete and the price is reasonable. The location is very convenient: Next to Jiefang Road is the main road. Go south to the station and go north to the iron tower. There are countless mobile phone shops around the hotel. It is very convenient to pay for phone calls or buy stored-value cards. Fully equipped: even 220V to 110V adapter socket. Buffet breakfast: It is a local Chinese meal with rich content. Service attitude: The front desk, room service, restaurant and other staff are very kind and actively try their best to help travelers. Staff service attitude is really comparable to five-star. I really want to find out what needs to be improved, but the bathroom is a bit narrow. 
0	The workmanship is not meticulous enough, and it is not mainly manifested by the jerky start button. When the CD-ROM drive is closed, it heats up and the shell will stick to fingerprints. 
1	I have read Carli once, and there will always be memories in my heart. I admire her as a woman, can have such a difficult and outstanding experience, difficult to temper people's will, and inspire people's fighting spirit. Carli has experienced many difficulties, but every time she can Solve it easily, face it bravely, let me raise the banner of confidence in my heart, flying high, if there are difficulties in the future, I have to learn from Carly, use my brain to think about everything, do my best, I The most admired is Carly's eloquence, she can convince everyone that this is the result of hard work, and we can do it, but what we do may not be good or appropriate.This book motivates me to strive to do better and better. .... 
1	The hotel’s service is very warm and always responds promptly to our room requests. The location is good, very close to Zhongshan North Street, easy to eat. 
0	"The first time I came to Dangdang to buy a book, I chose this book because of its sales and customer reviews. To be honest, this book doesn't have much readability. My son is only interested in the storytelling book. Maybe it's an age deviation. My son is four years old. The main title of this book, ""Busy Town"", is really not very attractive~~ "
0	I ordered the goods three weeks ago, and the delivery company delivered the goods on Saturday. I was not in the company. They said they would deliver them again in three days. They turned out to be returned to me, which delayed my time and asked me to evaluate. P, I'm so angry! I won’t buy books in Dangdang anymore~~~ 
0	If this kind of hotel is also a 3-star hotel, I really have nothing to say. Uncomfortable from the beginning of the check-in: Because I have not booked a 4-star hotel, Ctrip recommends staying here. It is a 3-star hotel, which is ok. Arrived after 12 o'clock in the evening, when you check in, the waiter does not ask you whether to swipe your card or pay cash after registration. He tells you directly, if you pay 500 deposit, I said I will only pay 200 yuan in cash. After the check in is over, the waiter is no longer visible, so look for the elevator yourself. The elevator is a mini-type, so if you can stand up to 4 people, you can't move. The room has an unpleasant smell, which makes you sick. I don’t know how long I haven’t wiped it on the table. I touched it with my hand. It was dark. I wiped the toilet paper several times. The bathroom door is broken, the door frame is full of big holes, like shells exploded, the room has no heating, I wake up in the middle of the night, I can’t find the quilt to add, so I have to press the clothes on my body to feel my body It's not cold anymore. Breakfast plus side dishes, no more than 10 kinds, don’t know what to eat, no fruit, just eat a bowl of porridge. When checking out, the waiter called on the floor to make a round of the room. After 1 minute, the waiter told me fiercely, did you take the yellow pages and you want to compensate. gosh! ! ! What yellow pages? After asking for a long time, he said that a book in the drawer was missing. Damn, such a dirty table, I didn't even touch the drawers, and I didn't even dare to use towels in the bathroom. What are you doing with your broken book? Did you put it out, or you put it somewhere else, find it yourself. MD, what a broken place. Tossing for a long time, still won't let me go. In the end, I don’t know if they found it or not, or they found that they didn’t put any yellow pages at all, no one explained to me, and no one apologized to me, but they could finally let me go, not yet Take the initiative to give me an invoice. After requesting to print, gave me a receipt. Fortunately, the rooms in the 4-star Jingdezhen Hotel have come out and you can move in. Quickly leave this place of right and wrong. After thinking about it, the front desk called up, and then called upstairs in about 1 minute and said that the book was missing. At such a fast speed, it seemed that I had already known what was missing, and people couldn't help but doubt its purpose. 
1	I thought that the Windows Vista Home Basic Edition software was difficult to use, and its compatibility was poor, but it was still very easy to use when I got started. I originally wanted to install everything I wanted, which was unexpected. 
0	The shower head fell off by itself and was repaired later. The toilet has been blocked. Asked for repairs twice, the attitude was very good, but the technology was not good, but in the end it was not solved, and the stool was suffocated! 
0	The book actually doesn’t say anything, and I don’t see where the value is. The author is a cow. He criticizes western medicine for nothing, and I feel that he doesn’t understand science 
1	Yes, I chose it for my friend. My friend is more satisfied, but there are fewer USB ports, and they are all on the left. The picture is wrong. 
0	"I have stayed in so many hotels, and I have never lived in such a small, dirty and smelly ""big bed room""! As soon as I entered the door, I was smoked out by a odor, and the windows were not reduced much after a day’s opening. The bathroom is small and dirty, disgusting! Since my husband and I entered the door, we could only be on the bed and the other could stand on the ground! The only advantage: the location is good, the commercial street downstairs is very lively, and there are snacks at night, just downstairs, not far from Daxiangguo Temple and Shanshangan Guild Hall, you can walk. However, the expectations for snacks must not be too high, so as not to feel deceived. Regardless of the price, there is really no way to see hygiene. "
1	I have been using ThinkPad, from the original 380D to the T series, and then to the X200 that the company recently equipped with. This machine was bought for my wife, who likes it very much. 
0	The rooms are small, carpeted, insufficient air-conditioning, and poor service. The reservation service should be cancelled immediately.

1	The hotel is very big, the service is poor, the rooms in Building A are also old, I will never live again. The environment is very good, maybe golfers can bear it. 
1	The configuration is very good, the keys are cool, the screen is perfect, and I am super satisfied! It is much cheaper than the computer city, it is very cool!!! 
1	The original product is genuine, and the seal has not been opened at the time of delivery. Because it was the first time to shop on JD.com and pick up the goods. After seeing the goods, I didn’t worry about the quality. Definitely authentic and licensed. This transaction is very funny. I placed an order on the evening of the 25th, and looked at it on the morning of the 26th. Since I found a new promotional cashback of 100 yuan, fortunately, I picked up the goods at my door. A single order saves 100 yuan. Hehe. 
1	Small and exquisite, suitable for certain occasions. As for netizens, it is easy to leave fingerprints, it is true, but just wipe it. The price of 2990 is really low, and the price is good. As for the weight, it's ok, the key is that the battery is heavy. 
1	Although the time when the case occurred is a bit far away from us, it does not prevent us from being curious about the truth. There is no sense of time dislocation, and no sense of stagnation in reading. It's just a nuanced description, which sometimes makes people feel a little complicated, but after all, it is inevitable to explain the details, so it doesn't matter. Generally speaking, I still like this work very much. The idea is exquisite and unparalleled. I am worthy of the name of the three major mystery novelists in the gold, and I also specially recommend other friends to read and read it. Maybe I will fall in love with reasoning just like me! 
1	Performance, appearance, brand fully meets all the needs of college students who have just entered the school to learn, play games, etc. The price is not more expensive than that of a desktop computer. 
0	A very average hotel, not enough for a 4-star level. I found that the appearance and photos of the hotel are far different, not very big. The lobby is very earthy and the room is very cold. It happened to be raining that day. When I checked in, the curtains were drawn and I woke up in the middle of the night when I slept. I found out that the windows were open in the morning. , Maybe I was too careless. The bathing place is not good, the shower room is very small and can't stretch out. The bedding is poor and the quilt is thin. The restaurant upstairs is very expensive. It costs 28 or 38 for a tomato scrambled egg. The knife sharpens is quite fast! Will not live next time, too bad! 
1	The piano paint surface is very beautiful and the appearance is atmospheric. The keyboard is different from other series, with good configuration and good performance. Anti-virus software is also sent, and the price is good. 
1	"Even if it is the most beautiful flower, Wanya, as a princess, can't escape the fate of the so-called ""tribute."" The splendid momentary love will not be the corner of the country in the end. Love, so perfect but lost, the ending of Wanya, bitter but practically portrays the life of a court lady. See all the infinite regrets in the world, just because love is so fragile. The three men love this flower god in different ways. She could have changed her choice to make herself relaxed, but she still clings to her love. After all, her love hurt her. Love is always so powerful! "
1	Seaview Garden is the best service of all the 5-star hotels I have stayed in. Besides, their Cantonese restaurant is very authentic and the price is reasonable. If you go to Qingdao, I will choose it again. Fantastic 5 star hotel, good location and environment, with best service and very nice staff, strongly recommend. The Cantonese restaurant is one of the best, worth to try!!! Additional review July 29, 2008: &#32431;& #20013;&#26041;&#31649;&#29702;&#65292;&#38750;&#24120;&#26834;&#65281; 
0	This hotel is too bad, the toilet feels not disinfected, and there is nothing to eat in the room, not even water, and the TV is not clear, the door is not in use, the toilet water has to wait for half an hour before pressing down. If the car is not broken and other hotels are full, I really don’t want to choose this hotel. 
0	No problem with the product! That is, Jingdong said that it will be shipped within 1-6 days, but the actual wait is about 10 days! In fact, it doesn't matter if you wait, but if you can't ship the goods on Jingdong in 6 days, don't write that it can be shipped in 1-6 days! Hope it can be improved in the future! 
0	The keyboard is not very stable, and it feels like it is about to tilt up. The appearance is a real fingerprint collector. 
1	This is a fairy tale. Although it is unrealistic, it is desirable. The relationship between people is messy without cleaning up. Therefore, if you are too enthusiastic about the person you don’t really like, it will easily cause an unbearable situation; no one wants to To be the one who blesses others to perfect others and is alone and lonely does not want to be the opposite of helplessness, so the masters are hurting themselves back and forth, which is really sinful. Sometimes I wonder why everyone wants to be spoiled, but cannot be responsible to everyone. Is this called selfishness? This feeling of being pampered is like poison, it can be addictive and hurt. So what is happiness? 
1	I can't say that there is no problem, but all the staff of the hotel are using a kind of enthusiasm to give every guest the best possible service, so I am willing to give the highest evaluation to this hotel. 
1	I have stayed in all the five-star hotels in Nanjing, and I chose this one (the former Shangri-La). Whether it is hardware facilities or services, it is impeccable... If there is a disadvantage, the room rate is very expensive, hehe, but I hope Ctrip can talk about more favorable prices. 
0	Yu Dan's, the lectures are okay, of course the translations are not as good as the masters. It is more suitable for students, the principle of being a person and doing things. 
1	Pointless perfect LED screen, rich interfaces (1394, HDMI, eSATA, infrared, Bluetooth...), strong performance (3DMark 06 ran more than 7000 points, almost catching up with my desktop), low heat (after running 3DMark 06 There is almost no heat in most of the surface of the machine) 
1	Advantages: 1 The room is large and very clean. 2 The location is good and it is very convenient to go there. 3 Good service attitude. Disadvantages: Not yet discovered. 
1	CBD center, there are no shops around, it is a bit reluctant to say 5 stars. I don't know why there is no hair dryer in the bathroom 
0	I booked it for a friend, originally planned for 2 days, but the check-in experience changed to Hyatt the next day. 1) I sent my friend to check in. All the parking spaces were locked, and I had to find other charges. In fact, they were in the same yard. 2 ) When I checked in, I said that there was no room reservation. I don’t know whether it was Ctrip or the hotel. 3) There was a long blood stain on the bed in the room, which was disgusting. 4) So I asked for a different room, but I was very unceremoniously told that it was only one. In between, I feel that giving me the room is a great favor and alms. 5) There is no hot water for bathing. My friend strongly requested not to book this hotel in the future 
1	The newly renovated hotel, the room is very new and very good, as a gold member of Marriott, fully enjoy the treatment of the gold card, very good. The breakfast variety is not rich enough. 
0	"The room is too small to imagine. It is recommended not to choose the big one, and the general sleeping feet are not straight. The room is not more than 10 square meters, the color TV is 14 inches, and the traffic is quite convenient. It is not within 10 minutes from the subway, but You must know which is the right way, if you move in, you must be mentally prepared, one word ""small""! "
0	When reading this book, one feels that the author is telling the readers how to do what, in order to prove that what she said is correct, and then give a bunch of examples of women around her from the perspective. The content is very empty, and the speech is pale and weak. It doesn't feel much depth. I regret buying this book and I won't read it for the second time. 
1	Personally feel that the configuration is mid-to-high end, with high CPU level, large memory, and good sound effects. The appearance of the notebook is more fashionable, and the keyboard is more sophisticated. The independent graphics card, the camera is clear, should be satisfied. 
0	The workmanship is average, the screen cover is not tight, it should be because there is no lock, it feels not as beautiful in the picture 
1	"When I was very lonely, I raised a dog twice. The result of the two times was that the dog was killed by the adults and made into a dish. From then on, I can't recall the days when I was with the dog. I would collect a lot of small furry toy dogs. Dogs are good friends of mankind. Dogs understand the human heart, and dogs have human nature. Unfortunately, ""people"" don't understand the human heart, and ""people"" have no human nature. I bought the book ""Goodbye, Ke Lu:"" and collected it as a child. Memory. May people return to the ""Garden of Eden"" created by God for Adam, and restore ""human nature was originally good"". Everyone will become good friends with animals, and there will be no war in the world. "
0	Install vt directly, and start the sata2 driver disk before installing, and then many devices have it? Find the driver from the Internet again, and finally installed it after a long time of tossing. HP is ill and does not provide a CD with all device drivers. There is less usb and no 1394. There is a slight beep when shutting down. Bios can change the project less. 
0	The single room is very small, only a small bed and a small sofa can be put down. The air conditioner in the first room is broken, and the room is changed, even the sofa is gone! The room facilities are outdated, but the bathroom is ok. It is not up to the four-star standard at all, and even business hotels like Home Inn can't keep up. It is strongly not recommended 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
0	It is recommended that Ctrip not cooperate with this hotel. The name is Samsung. I can barely see the star! First of all, not in the city (it costs 10 yuan to take a taxi to Hanjiang District, of course, if you can get it). The road behind the village is not close to the shop, and the traffic is extremely inconvenient; secondly, there is a musty smell as soon as I enter the hotel, and the carpet is full of stains, like a map. The most intolerable thing is that there are many small bugs crawling everywhere. I just rush There is no other way to live there during the typhoon, or I can't guarantee that I will live there again. 
0	The heat sink is very hot, you can heat the water cup, maybe AMD's CPU has this virtue, it is very troublesome to reinstall the XP system 
0	I read it patiently, just to talk more about it. Such books will also become popular, which shows that the reading level of our public is really not very good! 
1	The appearance looks pretty good, but some people don’t like mirrored ones, I personally like them better, but I’m satisfied. 
1	Many people who play Go will have a puzzle, that is, they are afraid of the strength of their opponents and suffer losses in battle, and how to enhance their combat effectiveness. Me too, I have always hoped that my strength will increase, and I hope to gain an advantage in the battle and even win. Let's take a look at the chess of Fighting Supreme Mr. Sakata! You can definitely find what you want from his falcon-like sense of smell and razor-like tactics. I like this set of books very much. She is also the essence of Mr. Sakata’s life work and is worthy of your possession! 
0	The equipment is very simple and the sense of service is very poor. The facilities of the restaurant are just like the beach on the street, and the sanitary conditions are very poor. 
0	"I don't know if the brother in front lived on the same day as me. I checked in on 7.24 and left with extreme grief and indignation early on the 25th. For the room, extremely disappointed. 1. It was extremely humid, with a strong musty smell, and called the waiter, saying that it was raining these few days and it was relatively humid. There was no way, or spray some air cleaner. Is this a reason? In a 4-star hotel, if it rains for two days, the guests will accept moldy rooms? ? ? What logic? ? ? ? ? 2. The room is extremely small. The one in front has another seat with two beds. My room is 6 square meters and the bathroom is about 2 square meters! It's definitely not alarmist. I took photos. If you want to confront me, please accompany me at any time! ! ! ! 3. The traffic is extremely inconvenient. Ask the front desk to call a car at least half an hour in advance, otherwise, hey, just wait! 4. Bedding! bed linings! ! It was damp and old, I also took photos, and there was a thick layer of dust on the back of the bed. I didn't look for the hair, because in that environment, it is not unusual to have hair. 5. The air conditioner is facing the bed, because both ends of the bed are against the wall, so no matter where the air conditioner is blowing, it is facing people. What's more terrible is yet to come: it was discovered at night-the air conditioner was leaking (believe it or not, go and look at the wall of your room), and the air outlet baffle cannot be fixed (it can only swing all the time). My goodness, poor us: open the window, outside the window is the constant hum of bugs and the roar of the outdoor air-conditioning unit in other rooms; closed the window, the 6-square-meter room makes us breathless. Is this a hotel? How do I feel like being locked up in a detention center! ! ! 6. We booked two identical rooms-business single rooms (because when booking, many rooms are no longer available, we can only book this). But the other room, no matter the size of the room, the equipment and items in the room, is much better than ours. When we asked the waiter why our room did not have plastic slippers or ""charged"" food (the most common mineral water is also charged) , The waiter replied: ""Because the room is too small, it will be even smaller if you put these!"" Comrades, can you feel how small the room really is from here? 7. When I checked out, I even asked me: ""Are you satisfied with the room?"" What do you mean? ? ? I booked for two days and left after staying for one day, can't you see it? It’s fine if you can’t see it, don’t you know how small and bad your room is? ? ? ? What does this mean? ? ? ? ? Do you want me to squat for a night in the ""detention center"" and put a smile on my face and say to you: ""Ah, it's so comfortable!!!"" Are you satisfied? ? ? ? 8. I can say responsibly that I am a very tolerant person. Otherwise, when I check in and when I check out, I can fight for reasons. You can also take a look at my previous evaluation of staying in the hotel, I think it is enough to prove something. 9. Last point, I want to say to Ctrip: Soon after Ctrip was founded, I have been your loyal member, and I became your diamond VIP a long time ago. I want to say to Ctrip, you are also responsible for recommending good hotels to your members. We don’t want every family to be cheap and good quality, but at least you have to be sure to exclude hotels that are cheap and bad. Isn't it too demanding? ? ? In addition, if you need it, I can give you a photo of my room as evidence, or provide it to you so that you can check it before booking. Isn't it difficult to ask for truth from facts? 10. Objectively speaking, breakfast is good. The attitude of the waiter is okay, although the content of the answer is straightforward. In view of the above, I think this hotel has disappointed me overall. We withdrew early the next morning! ! I dare not live anymore! ! ! ! For 398 yuan, we added some money and went to stay at the Oceanwide Celebrity Hotel. It was a world, and it really made me experience what it means to be ""from hell to heaven"". One additional point: After leaving Qingdao, I went to Zhengzhou and Shanxi. I just came back and was about to post a post. I saw the evaluation of the brother in front. I really felt the same, so I modified and supplemented it based on some opinions. The room I live in should be smaller than yours. I advise everyone who sees the post to find a guest house instead of staying in this 4-star hotel! ! ! Remember to remember! ! ! "
0	I bought the laptop on May 8th, and today I found out on May 9th that the power light on the laptop did not turn on after the power was connected. Unfortunately, I am now applying for a replacement. 
1	Hotel facilities are more general, but the sheets and towels are white and clean, and the service is warm. Perhaps the hotel was built in the early years, and the underground garage does not have direct access to the lobby, which is not very convenient. Meals are very suitable for those who are addicted to spicy food. It would be better to add some non-spicy dishes if you can take care of visitors from north to south. Also hope to pass service skills. 
0	Although Dangdang is very cheap, the original price is 23.80. I bought it back for more than 10 yuan, but many pages are missing, please review Dangdang or the Chinese Social Science Publishing House. 
0	Our family chose this hotel on the last day of a four-day tour in Xiamen, and I regretted it. Let me talk about transportation first. The hotel has its own pier, but there is only one boat per hour. If you miss it, you have to wait. And the pier is also very simple, our family has old and small, every time we get on and off the boat, we have to be careful. Besides the environment, we booked a deluxe room and ran in to take a look: the facilities inside were outdated, the wardrobe door was difficult to close, and the floor was not cleaned. The worst thing is that the air conditioner can only be used for cooling, and the bathroom does not have a bathroom heater. In winter, the island is still 1-2 degrees lower than the urban area. Turn on the faucet, the water is yellow, the hot water is also very small, not to mention taking a bath, washing your face is reluctant. Open the curtains, and there is a construction site outside! Living in a hotel, the heart is colder than the weather... People who like quietness will probably like it, because apart from the two people at the reception, the other staff are basically rare to see, so you have to figure out what you want. Originally wanted to make a local call, but told me that it costs 10 yuan/day to open a local call, dizzy! I'll make an inquiry call, or use my mobile phone! 
0	(Continued from above) Finally, I found out that the left side uses double-sided tape. What does this mean! Don't want me to change the memory? ? I hate that thing the most. This thing means that you can't see it for a short time, but you will find out after a long time. This is obviously a problem of the attitude of the manufacturer, and it is a perfunctory thing! 
1	"When I first showed my daughter this set of books, my daughter thought it was another book for her to study, so she was a little bit reluctant and didn't want to read it. Two days later, I found a daughter who was in a good mood and lay in bed with her to watch. After doing the exercises in the two books, my daughter did everything right, and she became interested at once, saying, this book is fun and I like it. In this way, I will do the exercises in this set of books every few days for my daughter. Except for the book ""Simple Arithmetic"", she doesn't like and can't do it (after all, she is only four years old), she likes to read the other books . There is a sense of accomplishment. "
0	The pre-installed system is not good. XP system BIOS is changed to IDE startup item. The first startup is changed to DVD. Everything is ok. It is not as troublesome as they say. The optical drive is like an engine. The Rising sent is really unnecessary. 
0	The room of 370, the price is very low, only the level of 150 in the mainland, the buffet variety is quite small, and a bunch of middle-aged FB men who drink red and beard all day come and go, very uncomfortable, and will never live 
0	I installed XP for him on the day I got it. I haven’t gotten it for a long time. I checked the Internet and found that this driver is quite good. It is recommended to buy this version and buy a vista disk first. 
1	"Looking at the comments, some storytellers are too small and worthless; some are too big to be convenient to carry, so I personally measured the size: the width of the book is 14 cm, the vertical length is 16 cm, and the thickness is 1.4 cm. The cover and the layout of the book are very popular. The paper effect feels the same as that of the Beautiful English series. I don’t know how to do it. I personally like the visual effects. After reading two articles, Mr. Bing Xin’s translation is really great. Like a reader’s comment, there are typos. It’s true. 60 articles, it should be ""empty"" shells, but the article is ""bao"" shells, but it does not affect reading, I can understand it, it is estimated that the proofreading is not careful "

1	The cost performance is high, HP's service attitude is also OK, the camera has a high quality, generally 300,000 pixels, this one has 130 pixels, and the bag is the original bag, which I prefer. 
1	It is very close to the railway station and the coach station. The taxi fares start (within five minutes). There is a 24-hour McDonald’s downstairs (orders can be delivered to the room for free). On the left is Pingyuan Shopping Mall, and the opposite is Theaters. 
0	The ordinary standard room of 160 yuan provided by Ctrip is not competitive. The room facilities are average, the sheets are broken, and the service is average. Some rooms in the business deluxe standard room do not have computers, or computers are just decorations and cannot even be activated. I am upgrading and replacing Sanyi room can only be checked in normally when the room is available. Looking forward to improvement. 
0	(1) The hotel brochure stated that drinking water is provided in the room, but there is no water in the kettle, so please advise the front desk. The front desk said that drinking water is the tap water in the bathroom (too disgusting), so you can ask the waiter to add water for me. 150ml of domestic drinking water in the refrigerator costs 10 yuan (about 1-2 yuan for drinking water bought outside). (2) There are a lot of charged items in the room, such as slippers (with free slippers), socks, etc., as well as movable sets. The text on the box says this. Thinking so well, why not provide drinking water? Customers are willing to charge even if they charge a fair price. (3) To give advice to the lobby manager is also sophistry and careless. (4) The humidifier in the room is very good for me, a southerner. 
0	Not as good as expected. It's just that all the questions are brought up, but there is not too much detailed explanation of the problems, which is a bit anticlimactic. 
1	We came to this hotel from the Disney's Hollywood Hotel in the afternoon on the 17th. The hotel is in an alley. It is really not easy to find anyone who has never been. The processing speed is very fast and the attitude is also very good. It takes about 5 minutes to complete. We were a little uncomfortable when we came to the room, because it was really small, especially when we had just stayed at the Disney Hollywood Hotel. The room area was only about 10 square meters, and the bathroom was about 3 square meters. It looked a bit old, but there were hair dryers and bathrobes. The service staff of the hotel have a very good attitude, they will carefully answer questions and provide suggestions. The location of this hotel is very good. It is about a 7-minute walk from the subway station and SOGO, and a 15-minute walk from Times Square. It is located in a prosperous area and quiet. 230 meters to the left from the gate is the bus station, which is very convenient to go everywhere, 2-4 yuan per person. We stayed in the city for 2 days and fully enjoyed the superior location. We have never taken the subway in Hong Kong, because after familiarizing ourselves with the surrounding environment, we find it more convenient to make ground transportation. When we went to Victoria Peak to see the night view of Hong Kong, we took the tram, which was not only convenient and cheap, but also the street view of Hong Kong. I ordered the airport drop-off service on the 19th, 70 yuan per person, very worthwhile. Because it takes 300 yuan to get to the airport by taxi, and about 200 yuan to take the subway, and you don’t have to run around with your luggage. A large luxury coach with large leather seats and a total of only 7 people in the car. It is really cool and I recommend everyone to use it. 
1	Not bad, but it is more difficult to find, because Changning Road is too long. If you take a taxi, the driver is usually not found, wasting a lot of time. 
1	Last year, I accidentally booked this hotel for a friend. Later, my friend asked me to book this hotel every time he came. I stayed in it once and I felt that it was pretty good and it was very convenient to travel. 
1	The appearance design is good, the workmanship is exquisite, and the speed of JD Express is also very fast, especially the price of 2699-100 is impeccable! 
0	Looking at the comments, it said that 4299 was sold and Rising Antivirus was given, but I don’t know when. If the news is true, it will be a bit depressing! 
1	Martin Luther King’s speech has always been my favorite and very exciting. He is also the person I admire the most. His voice often brings me strength and courage. This book has the same charm and seems mysterious, but many successful people have told us that you should have a dream, and this dream can be realized. This book will also bring you the strength and courage you need. You should Face your life confidently, chase your dreams optimistically, and live happily. Don't miss such a great work. As long as you understand him, your happiness will not be far away. 
0	This shop is too bad and the room has a musty smell, and the most unbearable thing is that the front desk work efficiency is extremely low! 
1	feels pretty good in general. The rooms are clean and simple. It was disclosed on the Internet that it is located in the most beautiful section of Haihe. I specifically asked for a room on the 6th floor, but I did not see the shadow of Haihe... 
1	I started practicing on the day I got the book. I bought a copy purely for my liking. I didn’t think it was any good at first, but after practicing one page every day for a week, everyone around me said : Girl, it looks a little bit. I thought about it with joy, and it turned out that gradual progress is an attitude. Perseverance and seriousness will have results. It is recommended that everyone follow the rhythm of the book. Don’t be greedy for the beautiful words and draw first. You still have to learn to walk before running, right! Of course, this is my advice for a beginner. 
0	The memory is a bit less, and the location of the battery makes the left side of the palm rest easy to heat, and the heat dissipation is at the back. However, if the USB mouse is used, it must pass the heat dissipation position, which will cause the USB cable to easily heat up! There is a large gap between the stitching of the display, so the abrasive tool needs to be improved. 
0	I have seen overwhelming compliments before, so I bought it dubiously. I opened it and saw that the market liked it from the introduction. There are also lesbians. The little character description is very close to our usual work and life. , Some chapters in the book are not only meaningful for reference, but also meaningful for learning! 
0	This book disappointed me too much. I didn't write it in depth at all. It felt like I was advertising for myself, and I would never buy this kind of book from China. 
1	Service: There is barely a 4-star level problem overall: the hardware level is low, the room sound insulation is poor, the door is thin and the wall is thin, the checkout time is long, the breakfast quality is low, but in this area, there is no better hotel than this for selection. 
1	A good book recommended by a friend. It is easy for couples to love each other. It is difficult to get along with each other. The bumps in life need to be balanced with a loving heart. The way a couple gets along is about art, especially the wisdom of the wife’s life. It is needed after more than 20 years of marriage. Adjust it, there is nothing new, and I can't talk fiercely like a baby. The temper of life makes me a strong housewife. How can I tell others how to spoil you and love you? I have learned a lot. I really have to act like a baby. I really have to enjoy life, or the family we have worked so hard to create has to hand over to the mistress, and for the family's own happiness, learning. 
0	To be honest, the environment is very bad, next to the old train station, although the new train station is opened, it will not be noisy, but I don't understand why the decoration is not in place, it is not comparable to the 3 star hotels in the big city, and The room booked through Ctrip is really not very good. I booked the hotel in Xiamen through Ctrip again. If it is really like most netizens say, although Ctrip’s room reservation is cheaper, but the room is inferior to the hotel, I definitely don’t believe it. Ctrip!!! Additional review February 19, 2008: 
1	Jingdong’s cheapest 14-inch notebook, plastic case, high cost performance, T4200 CPU, G40 motherboard, DVD burning, 160G hard drive, the configuration is really cost-effective, the current mainstream configuration, good! 
1	"I like this one the most. Although I have earned my tears, I find that I love to read these sad and painful texts more and more. It is indeed the stepmother who came from Gang Da, and Dong Zi’s love for Jia Qi is absolutely unique. , But true love may not be able to be together, remember the phrase ""At that time, there was nothing but courage!"" Now I have no courage, I can only comfort myself by watching such novels, love is So unsatisfactory, you have to be open-minded! Hard, hard! "
1	The keyboard is well-designed, and it’s easier to use than the 14-inch. Several shortcut keys are inductive, practical and compact 
1	The house is good and the location is good, but it's not worth the price. At the same level, the Huating Hotel in Xuhui District is only 600 yuan, but here it costs 1,000 yuan. 
0	When the keys on the keyboard were struck a little faster, some letters were clearly struck, but they just didn't go up. It seems that the key is mainly on the left. 
0	I originally wanted to buy it back for a good friend, but when I opened it, the content was too simple. I just drew some cars, small animals, and so on, and I returned the goods. 
1	I bought an as5530 machine for 3999 yuan in Jingdong before. It is also a 780g motherboard, which is okay to use. This time I picked a machine for my cousin. I couldn't use any independent graphics card. Later, I imagined it was good. At least I couldn't get the card when I connected the plasma to watch the HD. Even if the price is cheap, this machine is enough. In addition, this machine does not have a camera (I don't know if there is a microphone, I forgot to try it after I got the machine), so many friends may feel uncomfortable, which is just right for me. For the little sister who is studying, she was originally restricted from chatting with QQ. Without the camera, it will save some video conversations. 
0	The disadvantage of BC6 is that there is no Bluetooth. Although BC6 is more expensive, but seeing Jingdong sell out of stock, you know that the eyes of the people are discerning. 
1	The room is relatively clean and comfortable! Songjiang has fewer business hotels! This hotel is ok! 
1	This is the second time I stayed at this hotel this year. This time I went to HK shopping with my friends. This hotel is my first choice. Although the hotel is far from the city, there is a free shuttle bus from the Peninsula Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui (on the hour) ) Back to the hotel. The hotel room is very large, about 20 square meters. I stayed in two rooms with invincible sea view. When I checked in, I chose the room on the yacht club side. You can see the sea. In addition, the rooms below the sixth floor The room also has a terrace, which feels very good. The hotel’s breakfast is also very rich (worth a try), you can sit on the edge of the open-air garden, and take a walk in the garden after breakfast. It feels really good. Not far from the hotel is the beach. Not far from the hotel, there are also 7-11 (24-hour convenience store), a small supermarket (where fresh fruits are sold), and a restaurant that eats Southeast Asian cuisine. I don’t remember the name. The only dissatisfaction of the hotel is that the facilities in the room are relatively outdated, but the bathroom is very good, with a separate shower room. If you are a family going to HK for vacation, you can't go wrong with choosing this hotel. 
0	"Women, especially girls, are thoughtful, sensitive and romantic, and they are more likely to be far-sighted and thoughtful. This book is to let women know how to be down-to-earth, don't be over-minded, and don't think that love is all about a happy life. Generally speaking, it is not bad, but I prefer ""What is the Happiness of Women"", which is more in line with the reality of Chinese women. "
1	The protagonist in the story is just as ordinary as himself. He has his own dreams but also has many shortcomings of his own. He has been reflecting on himself and the path he has taken in constant efforts. But I think the protagonist in this story is always very happy, whether it’s a bad job or a person walking on the street feeling lonely, but at least every time he picks up the phone, he always greets his parents. I never feel alone anymore. Very interesting book, but calm and a little humorous. The style of the author as always. recommend. 
0	Many massage ladies call at night, which is very annoying! Tell them not to fight anymore or to fight the same! The front desk cannot pre-authorize with a credit card, so I must pay a deposit in cash, and otherwise I store my luggage, which makes me drag my luggage to the bank to withdraw money! (Fortunately, the bank is near, or else...) 
0	After receiving it, I found that there was a crack on the disc. I have contacted dangdang to return the goods. I suggest dangdang to change the express. 
1	The basic configuration is okay, very light, and now I go back and forth to the office every day, and I don’t feel at all on my back. If you are not satisfied with the configuration, you can buy accessories and upgrades yourself. It doesn't cost much, and it's easy to do it yourself. The IBM interface is very convenient to open. High-end models sell at a higher price, but there are more accessories to buy a set of extras. The replaced accessories can also be sold or left for personal use. I bought a 320G hard drive and 2G memory at the same time, and replaced the original hard drive as a mobile hard drive. The cost was several hundred yuan lower than the price of a high-end model. I also had an extra mobile hard drive. 
1	I can buy it when cashback is available. Generally speaking, the speed is not bad. At this price, it is very good. 
0	The overall feeling is relatively poor, the room furniture is old, and the carpet in the business suite is actually covered with dark spots, which makes people very uncomfortable to see. Because of our work, we live in Kunshan for a few days every month, and my colleagues also commented that Yuxing was too dirty. As long as there are other options in the future, Yuxing is determined not to stay. 
1	This book is really practical. The content in it is very colloquial and authentic. The attached CD has recordings, which are very pure and stored in MP3. They are often used to listen to them when nothing is wrong. The effect is very good. They are simple but practical sentences in daily life, and the topics are also very wide. In short, good value for money. Moreover, I bought this book online after I was optimistic about it in the Book Building. I compared it on several websites in advance. Dangdang is the best deal! Hehe, I will continue to patronize in the future. At the same time, I also hope that Dangdang will continue to work hard to provide good service and give back to customers. 
0	If the manual is not detailed, the system can’t be entered after booting. I wonder if Samsung’s screen is good? Some people say it is AUO LED, which one is better? ? 
1	The iPod and lanyard earphones that were forgotten in Room 3226 on June 8 have been received, thank you Baiyun Villa! The Chinese restaurant food and hotel management services in Baiyun Mountain Villa left us with a very good impression, praise! 
0	Order 184477629, why is it out of the warehouse at 14:43:34 2007-7-11, there is no information until 15:30 on July 21st today? Is Dangdang's promised 5-6 days delivery slogan true? Why is there no way to explain when calling the maintenance hotline? Does Dangdang have no knowledge of its own logistics and delivery status? Is there a commitment to customers? Is there a solution to customer complaints? This is my second order. The first order number is 162957864. It took more than 20 days to receive the book. How many days will it take this time? The last time I said people did not go to work during the Spring Festival, what about this time? What reason? Can anyone answer me, where is my book and why is it like this? 
1	The hotel accommodation environment is good, the front desk service is very warm, the room can see the Yangtze River and Gezhouba, but the shower facilities in the bathroom are not very useful, overall it is a good place! 
0	Domestic foundry, the design of the battery part is unreasonable. After the battery is installed, the side parallel to the keyboard is a little higher, and it may touch the screen. 
1	I haven't figured out the price yet, and I lost 100 when the goods arrived. This is a bit sweaty, but I don't have to say yet. I just bought it and changed to XP. The choice of netbook! 
0	I bought a total of 6 computers and just delivered it. I paid for it and didn’t unpack it. I was shocked as soon as I unpacked it. The keys on the keyboard were knocked out. I was dizzy. Are you selling licensed products? It's not a repaired machine, I request a return! It hasn't returned yet! 
1	I bought it on behalf of a friend. He liked it very much. I accidentally dropped it on the bus and bought another one. 
1	The price is high, the service is average. The view outside the window is ok. Breakfast is not bad 
1	The works of the world-famous comparative law scholar Yafu Omu. The scholar is the master of German comparative law scholar Zweigt. He has studied in Germany and is proficient in several foreign languages. He has his own profound and unique insights into comparative law. As an orientalist, the cultural atmosphere of his thinking growth is somewhat similar to that of China, so studying this book should be of great benefit to the Chinese who study comparative law. You can read this book in comparison with Zweigt's General Theory of Comparative Law, and you will definitely benefit a lot. 
0	"One word----""Great disappointment""!!! Before I went to Guangzhou, I studied on Ctrip for a long time, and then I chose Elan at the request of my husband because of the ""CHINA----lonely planet"" he brought from Europe. I recommended this hotel with perfect words. Looking at the pictures and introduction online, I think it should be good (no reviews). I thought it should be similar to the level of ""One Family"". But when I entered the room, I found that the picture is really good The difference is too far. The room is very small, there is no place to put luggage, there is even no place to sit. A very small writing desk has a very small ""LCD TV"". If you want to lie in bed and watch TV, I'm afraid You need a pair of clairvoyance; if you want to use that desk, you must be very slim to sit in that position, and you need to bring a laptop smaller than 12 inches, otherwise you can’t put it down. The room is not clean, first of all The 330 yuan double bed room I entered, there was still hair floating in the toilet. Later, I immediately changed to a 560 yuan suite, which is actually a little bigger, with more sitting space, sofa and table and bigger Ordinary TV. The room facilities are very old, some parts of the floor have been turned up, sound insulation is not good, and the hot water pressure is not enough... The front desk service is not bad, the waiter can speak English; but I did not see the baggage at all. Personally, it is not worth the price; personal opinion, it is not recommended to stay! "
0	I don’t feel like jumping very well. I don’t like the book she wrote. The content is small. Many of the same ideas appear many times in different places in the book, but the meaning is almost the same. It feels a bit deceptive. 
1	The hotel is relatively close to Lan Kwai Fong and soho food area. There is a direct bus from the hotel entrance to Causeway Bay. It is a good value for money hotel in the noble area of Mid-Levels. 
0	"1 The hotel does not have basic necessities, such as conversion plugs and kettles, which are all lacking! The reason for the lack is ""Because the family hotel room is full, so there is no more spare supplies to replace"" (this is the original words of the hotel attendant) 2 There are remnants in the hotel kettle, about the thickness of a one yuan coin. The hotel attendant even said ""I know this situation, but there is no way""! 3 The breakfast in the hotel is very poor, not as good as a 3-star hotel. 4 In winter, heating and air conditioning are provided on demand, and basically not available regardless of request; 5 The heating is the same as snoring, and it is noisy throughout the night (because I check out immediately ); 6 The name of the water heater does not match the truth, it should be called ""water heater"" because it is basically not hot "
0	"Although the content of this book is not much, the illustrations are very large, vivid and vivid. The stories in it are things that children have encountered and are very enlightening. My daughter liked it after reading it and encountered it during surgery. For similar things, she would say ""David, no"", hehe, it seems that it was affected by subtle influences. In general, I personally feel that this book is good, no wonder it is a book that has won an award. "
1	The triple room we stayed in was very spacious and the bathroom was not big, but it was very clean. The hotel restaurant is very affordable. As long as we can return to the hotel, we will eat in the restaurant. The surrounding traffic is very convenient. Basically, you can go to various attractions with one car, and it is also very close to Shichahai and other places. Recently, the hotel has been renovated outside, but it does not affect the internal hygiene and evening rest. Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay. 
0	The workplace is like a battlefield. It’s vividly illustrated in this novel. Lara is as diligent as an old scalper, but his character is more stubborn; Wang Wei is upright but a bit naive; He Haode has a keen thinking and unique vision, but unpredictable. Liszt advocates the moderation and does not like to make decisions, but he is a gentle and discerning boss; Ke Bide is a natural butler, but too harsh; Daixi is too paranoid but unscrupulous but has to admire her courageous perseverance Tony Lin is not as experienced as Wu Wei in business management, but he is exquisite and can control his subordinates firmly. Although John is often quite sinister, he is always against Wang Wei, but he is also a smart person. Li Wenlong is gentle on the surface. But the city is deep and hardworking, but it does not affect his interpersonal relationship in DB, because he knows what is important and what is less, and he is willing to help the people in the group at critical moments; Huang Hong has excellent skills, but the interpersonal relationship is still unable Handle it properly and be careful; Rose is experienced but bleak. There are also Pamela, Zhou Liang, Jason, Helen, Wang Qiang, Roger, Qi Haotian and so on. All of these people have distinctive personalities and their own uniqueness. After reading this book, it is thought-provoking, and the story is fresh and practical. Both newcomers and talented veterans can benefit a lot. 
0	No camera, no system (a trouble for beginners), to highlight the power of the independent display and CPU, it must run at full speed and the battery is not durable (hehe, I don’t know if this is not enough, only 2 of the 6-cell batteries Hours. Now there is no 9-cell battery to sell... Haha). 
1	write it again:) My son likes this book. The plot is not complicated, but the book is very cute. The animals in the book are very fun, have their own character, fun, and profession, and even have their own ideas. The relationship is also very real, especially the three-dimensional pictures. The baby likes, likes, likes, likes, likes, likes, as a parent, I don’t think there are any special requirements, this is a good book, right? 
1	In addition, the stories in the book are also suitable for reading to lower-class children 
0	Real feelings after staying in the store: I can’t sleep at all, the soundproofing of the room is too bad, it is the worst soundproofing hotel I have ever stayed in, I can hear the normal conversation of the two people next door very clearly, the closet positions in the 2 rooms There is no wall at all, it is separated by the back panel of the closet. In the morning, the waiter actually made a phone call at the door of my room, and the phone did not ring. He heard very clearly. In short, you and Ben could not sleep. 
1	T4200cpu is good, with a camera, with DVD burning, and upgraded memory. The speed is superb. The extended package card with battery can be packaged for 1 year. 
0	This hotel is so bad, there are companies in the hotel, and there are many more, have you seen such a hotel? This is the first time for me, and I won't live again next time. During the rush hour, it takes 25 minutes to go downstairs. I have calculated that I will kiss you for two days. The doorman is like a grandfather. 
1	Very nice hotel, I live in a business room, the Internet speed is very fast, the download reaches 2M/s, very cool! Met old friends in the hotel...the world is really small! 
0	The hotel’s service was very good at the time of check-in. The lobby and the room were average. After check-in, I found that the hardware of the room was poor, such as the air conditioner, toilet, especially the TV remote control, which was very poor and could hardly be used. The air conditioning in the room doesn't work, and the corridor has a smell. The breakfast was very poor. The waiter was frantically picking up things at nine o’clock, and he didn’t ask the guests if they needed it. It was very poor. The evaluation I had seen was not very accurate. I immediately moved to Longcheng the next day. Shanxi is really good. There is no good hotel, I don't know why, it's weird! 
1	The name is very loud, but the facilities are not very good, especially the single double room, there is no quiet room. Had to change to a double room after moving in. 
0	The backlight of my mute button didn't light up. I only bought it for more than 10 days. I don't know if I can change it (today is the 15th day, it depends on what Jingdong said, hoho). . . The workmanship of the machine is still not meticulous enough, and the gap between it and the Thinkpad is very big. 
0	I have benefited a lot from watching Too Dan's video of interpreting the Analects, and I want to buy a book to collect. Obviously, the submission was successful, but the goods did not arrive, very depressed... 
1	"Today, when you and I are all confused by interests and material desires, today when money worship and millennia of Confucianism conflict with each other, the appearance of ""Wolf Totem"" is undoubtedly contemplative. I just graduated from high school and I may not be qualified to comment on this society. What? But when my teacher recommended ""Wolf Totem"" to me, I did not hesitate to place the order form after reading the introduction. Just after reading a chapter, there seems to be a certain kind of passion in my blood. To explore the impulse of the author's consciousness. This kind of good book does not need too much words to describe its beauty. It should also be a text that surpasses ordinary people. "
1	I lived in a standard room for 680 yuan a night, and my wife and I lived very happily. We went from Lanzhou to Jiayuguan and then to Dunhuang on this trip. Only the service of this hotel reached the level of 4 or 5 star hotels. It was very kind and proactive. Mingsha Mountain can be seen from the room, the view is first-rate. The restaurant food is average. The buffet breakfast is mainly Chinese and fairly average. The a la carte breakfast (also included) is served at the hotel’s rooftop restaurant. It is mainly Western style. We don’t have time to enjoy it. It might be better. However, we used to have a drink in the open air area of this restaurant. The stars feel very good. The hotel is in the suburbs, but in fact it is 3 kilometers away from the city and 4-5 kilometers away from the night market. However, taxis rarely pass by. There is a No. 3 bus that stops at the entrance of the hotel. It runs every 5 minutes and gets to the city in 10 minutes, so it is not very inconvenient. Additional comments August 8, 2008: Internet speed is relatively poor, but it is free, so there are not many requirements. 
0	The hotel is a four-star hotel, but it is also two-star, and there are too few breakfast options. If it is a four-star, do it as a four-star. If the room price is low, don't give it a four-star, and consider changing to other hotels in the future. In addition, broadband has to charge 20 yuan. 
1	The screen has no dead or dark spots, which is pretty good. The configuration is cost-effective. It has been used for half a month and is basically normal. 
0	The pre-installed Vista system is very rubbish, and it will be ready the next day. But what’s even more rubbish is that it’s very troublesome to install a new XP, and I asked my classmates to do it. In addition, updating and installing various software took me two days! trouble! 
1	The goods are finally received, but the speed is very fast. I feel that the quality is okay. Some of the colors of the pictures are white background. I think they are better colored. If you give a few more hooks, it will be fine. And it is recommended that mothers do not hang the pictures in the bathroom I made a mistake nearby, and the picture may have been deformed due to moisture. I thought it was a quality problem. Later I saw the unhanging picture and it was quite good 
0	1. The 4 rubber pads at the bottom of the notebook are not flat, and they always shake left and right when typing. 2. The time cannot be saved, as long as the time is reset to zero after the power is off. 3. Mcafee cannot be registered. 
1	I saw that many evaluations were very high, and the results were expected to be higher. It was not as good-looking as expected, the appearance was average, and the texture was lacking. After all, the price is. 
0	My child loves it. The painting is beautiful and wonderful. Suitable for babies over 1 year old to understand. My children hum a birthday song when they see a little bear’s birthday; when they see a little gorilla laughing at someone’s bedwetting, they will learn to cover their mouths and laugh; when they see a little rabbit crying with an open mouth because of falling ice cream, they will Laugh; see the big mouth of the little hippo, I will touch it very much. . . There are countless such interesting reading moments. This set of books is good. However, in the process of reading, children can't understand it right away, and parents need to patiently speak over and over again. Ha ha. . . 
0	High heat, no microphone, 6346c sound quality, it can only be said that it can emit sound, nothing more. 6346c's voice is small and broken. 
1	I saw from Ctrip.com that everyone spoke highly of the Seaview Garden’s service. We went to Qingdao to escape the summer heat in late July and stayed here specially. Staying for 5 days feels the same, and it really deserves its reputation. It can be said that the service in the hotel we have stayed in is first-rate. There are a few things that touch me in particular. For example, Western restaurant supervisor Wang Jie and waiter Jin Yusheng heard that I had stomach problems. Besides taking care of me during meals, they also brought me some raw peanuts, saying that eating a few a day can protect the gastric mucosa. I love to eat green vegetables, every time I fry a small plate individually. It was raining on the day we arrived in Qingdao. The customer relations officer escorted us directly into the room and checked in in the room. He saw plaster on my feet during registration, and quickly asked the floor attendant to send me some Yunnan white ointments. Later, the blue bar waiter also noticed that I was limping while walking and gave another box of plasters. I basically recovered after posting. I have chronic pharyngitis and cough when I enter the air-conditioned room. The waiter in the lobby immediately fetched me the Golden Throat, and the waiter in the blue bar brought cough syrup again. I see results soon after taking it. The floor attendants always clean up the room after we go out, and the room is always tidy every time we come back, and milk is delivered in the evening. This is a treatment we have never received when traveling abroad. When we walked into the hotel, all the employees we saw smiled and greeted us, which made us feel very kind. I also noticed that the breakfast food provided by the hotel, fruits and small gifts to the room are all of good quality. All this shows that the general manager of the hotel is well-managed and has trained so many employees so well that it is not easy for them to establish the concept of customer first and provide humane service, courtesy, enthusiasm, meticulousness and thoughtfulness. In fact, as a five-star hotel, the hardware of the store is not ideal. but. Their superb service does attract customers. We are still our first choice for the summer vacation next year, and of course the Seaview Garden is our first choice for a hotel in Qingdao. 
1	Yes, it should be recommended in hotels of the same grade! 
0	I asked the customer service of Emchines, it is indeed that the construction of GL40 Emchines' after-sales network is not very good. There is no outlet in Harbin. The space bar seems to be bad 
1	The deepest memory is what the author said: Parental love is as deep as the sea, but there are differences in quality! This is a book that is worth reading as a teacher and a parent. It is a big collision and impact on traditional Chinese educational thoughts and methods. In the unit, there are also many children of colleagues who are working as left-behind children, and there are more or less problems. I often hear them expressing many helpless sighs, but they are helpless. What a pity! If I have my own child, I will bring my own, no matter how painful or tired. 
1	The environment around the hotel is good and it is very convenient to go to attractions. The front desk has a good attitude, and the check-in and check-out speed is very fast. 
0	Because reading the book reviews is very tempting~ I think I am in my early twenties and I should learn how to manage my future... But I was disappointed when I bought it. The content is very empty ~ the writing is too superficial. There are some advices for girls, the examples given are nothing novel, nor deep enough. The quality of the book is not good. Like cheap romance novels, there are people around who want to buy them, so they just give them to her. 
0	The room is very small The room facilities are very old, because the renovation has been 10 years. The air in the room was very poor. When I opened the door, a very big smell of smoke and musty rushed toward you. The service was not bad. Although I changed from the 6th floor to the 9th floor, the air in the room was still very poor, very poor, and unacceptable! ! ! 
0	"Coming from Chongqing, it was already more than 5 o'clock in the afternoon when we got down from the airport. As a result, the room was not cleaned. It was OK for half an hour, and it was not good at 6 o'clock. It was 15 minutes. gosh! At 7 o'clock, it's not good, and negotiated with the main station, ""I can't help it"", and entered the room at 7:30. The aisle is dark when the elevator goes up. I really don't know how to get the 4 stars? Never encountered such a bad 4-star hotel. Strongly not recommended! ! ! "
1	In the same grade of laptops, the cost performance is high, the configuration is sufficient, the brand effect is good, the appearance is good, and more advantages are to be discovered in use 
0	The heat dissipation needs to be improved, and it is still very hot. Intel refuses to develop a low-power chipset, so it uses 945 to fudge. 
0	The 160G hard drive feels a bit small, deducting the pre-installed programs of the system, only 120G can be used, if the hard drive 320 is just fine. It's a pity that the original VISTA system is cut off. It is not easy to use if it is not cut off, which will affect the speed. 
1	It's amazing to read Chi Li's writing about the environment she created for her children since the birth of her child, and make her child grow proud of success. I am also a new mother, and I am deeply confused about how to educate children. I am a product of exam-oriented education. I am buried in the mountains of books every day. In the end I still work as a teacher in an ordinary school. At that time, I hated the school and hated the teacher. Now I don’t want my child to repeat the same mistakes, but how to do it? Whether it is successful or not, this book brings me new enlightenment. Very nice book 
1	The overall feeling is good, but the fly in the ointment is that the sound insulation between the rooms is not very good, and the price feels slightly higher. 
1	"Staying at Regent, I feel very good. Because it is a new hotel, it does have a faint smell of paint, and the room is relatively new. The rooms are of good size, the bathrooms are well-equipped, and the service attitude is very good. Internet speed may have improved, but I feel fine. There are free power strips and fruit knives. . . A series of daily necessities are provided for free, very careful. The buffet in the evening is 68 yuan per person, the dishes are average, even if it's past. There are several restaurants outside the hotel, including Xibei Shino Noodles. Xibei's dishes are amazingly large, and it is better to go to Xibei to eat more people in the hotel. The hotel has Cantonese evening tea at 21:30-24. I have eaten it several times. The taste is authentic, but the variety of dim sum is slightly less. what. The hotel is located in Qingshan District, Baotou is divided into Kun District and Qingshan District. Relatively speaking, Kunming District is the most prosperous, followed by Qingshan District. Big shopping malls like Baobai are all in Kunming, and the fare from the hotel to Baobai business district is more than 12 yuan. There is also a Wangfujing Department Store in Qingshan District, which is relatively smaller than the Baobai Commercial District, and it costs more than 8 yuan to take a taxi from the hotel. Galaxy Plaza is some distance away from the hotel. Take a taxi for 9,10 yuan. There is a ""Kelilong"" supermarket on the side of Galaxy Plaza which is open for 24 hours. There is a small shop on the first floor of the hotel, and there are basically no supermarkets around. This time I was staying in time to catch up with several companies meeting here. Sometimes the corridor was a little noisy, and there were several people knocking on the wrong door in the evening. In theory, it has nothing to do with hotel management. I hope that in the future, I will try my best to let the conference group live on the first floor, maybe this can be better. Overall I feel that Regent is very good and will stay here in Baotou in the future. "
0	Maybe the expectations were too high. After I said this, I read a part and felt that it was too vague. I don't know where to put the book now. . . 
0	I booked a double room on the website, and it became a double room when I arrived at CHECK IN, although it was changed for me later. The hotel is in a good location, with high-speed and light rail at the entrance. But the hotel rooms are very clean and decorated The bad, very old, I can't live with this price!!!!! I won't live in this hotel anymore! 
0	At least I didn't find it good-looking, it didn't appeal to me at all, there was nothing ridiculous, some words were very profound. The printing of the book is very good, the content is not well introduced. 
0	The room I lived in was close to the road, which was noisy. There is a smell in the room. Not as clean as Jinjiang. Staying is not recommended, breakfast is ok. 
0	1. Trouble installing the system 2. Without Bluetooth, after accidentally installing the Bluetooth driver, it will automatically turn on and off repeatedly and cannot enter the system. 3. The screen flashes badly. The frequency cannot be adjusted. 4. The price is reduced by 100 yuan on the third day after buying. Really Depressed. Can you return... 
0	The order stated that the book has been sent to me, but it was found that it was not delivered when the book was delivered. What's the matter? I really want this book, why not give it away 
0	It took a few days to find out that the second half of the book was printed with serious errors. There were more than forty pages inverted. I was a VIP in Dangdang. I discovered this for the first time, and the inverted part was still missing pages. Such a serious printing error, how do you inspect the goods when they are in the warehouse? How are the goods inspected when they leave the warehouse? I have applied for return for so many days, and there is no response. If you do not return this week, continue to complain. Feeling dizzy. Also, the content of this book is out of space, just a superficial exchange. Crazy doesn't like it. 
0	The content is thin and meaningless. It is helpful for people with no literacy level, but if you are a person with a certain degree of expertise, it is not interesting. Empty and boring, it doesn't take a long time to read the whole book. 
1	There are too few varieties of breakfast, the traffic is fairly convenient, and the service attitude is not very good. I asked the hotel to buy the map from the old room. 
1	After waiting for several days, I finally got it. The configuration and brand are all satisfactory. It is a good choice for business individuals. 
1	I bought it for my eldest wife, haha. Keyboard, battery is good, battery can last more than 6 hours keyboard, battery is good, battery can last more than 6 hours keyboard, battery is good, battery can last more than 6 hours 
1	The appearance is small and the white is very delicate. Complete functions, wireless, Bluetooth, 160G hard drive, long battery life. 
1	"Red Lady's book has never disappointed me. From the original red satin to the later green door, oranges and blue silks, they all have their own brilliance. They will not be printed in the same mold, so let us Readers all have new expectations...about touching, love, family, friendship, the Red Lady has already told us with her own brushwork this ""Hidden Scarlet Mask"" also let me see the other side of the Red Lady! There is the hometown she knows the most and loves most, Xiangxi... There are even more emotional elements in it...~ So, it is worth looking forward to and worth reading! "
1	The heat dissipation is very good, and the appearance is also very impressive. If you don't have two computers at home, I really want to buy another one. 
1	Side A is very bright. I used it as a mirror in the morning. The fan sound is very small. The heat dissipation is also very good. When installing the system, the C drive must be formatted first, and the cloned version of XP should pay attention. Now drive down. 
1	"A very good book. When I read that the animal actors of the ""Caravan Circus"" told Orio the little lion how they were treated in the circus, my daughter said, ""I cry. ""I took the opportunity to tell her that animals, like humans, are members of the earth family. Animals are our friends. Humans and animals must live in peace. Protecting animals can maintain the biodiversity on the earth and maintain the biodiversity on the earth. Sex can maintain the ecological balance of the earth, so that human beings can survive well... "
1	This is the second Acer computer I bought on JD. It’s functionally different from the first 4930. I gave it to my friends and it’s okay overall. The 14.0 screen is slightly smaller than my own, and it’s beautiful for girls. 
1	"""Four Seasons Clock"" is really good, the illustrations are very beautiful, the language is fresh and smooth, and the tone is lively and interesting. The translation quality is great, and the words are precise and vivid. As a popular science book, concise and accurate words are very important. The child looked very attentively as soon as he got it. I also watched it for a long time and didn't want to put it away~~~ I recently discovered that those children's books seem to be just as much as I love to read them. So, I really don't pay much attention to the so-called age segment now. As long as the drawing is the style I like, the story is a pleasing way to tell, no matter the language level, the whole picture is collected. "
0	The breakfast is very simple and poor. It is far from the guest room. It is very inconvenient to go to the annex building at the back or to walk through the winding logistics. The deluxe standard room I live in is a bit old and simpler. There was only one person for luggage storage, and 7 to 8 customers waited for the delivery and delivery, waiting for about 20 minutes. There was only one person who issued and settled the check-out. When it was processed at 12 o'clock, there were about 10 customers waiting. The receptionist said; the leader only arranged a computer for the check-out and invoicing procedures, but I waited enough It took 30 minutes to finish. Far behind the four-star service. There are no slopes on all the steps, and the trolley suitcase can only be carried up, not to mention the help of the porter. 
0	The built-in system is too cheap, and the partition is still hidden. I bought a laptop-specific sp3 version and installed it, and sometimes I can’t shut it down. Everyone said that this configuration is okay to install Vista? I have a genuine copy. And should I buy a silicone cover for this keyboard? It is not easy to wipe the ash in 
0	The decoration of the hotel is relatively old, the soundproofing of the room, mainly the soundproofing of the bathroom is very poor, can only be regarded as average 
0	It’s sad that the VISTA system can’t be partitioned. If you have XP, it’s just fine. It’s a pity that you didn’t catch up with the activity of adding one yuan to the memory. 
1	The delivery is quite fast, with orders at 7 o'clock in the morning and delivery at 12 noon. Friends looked at the configuration and said that this machine wanted to be a great value. 
0	It's a bit heavy, and the screen has some color cast. It is a bit difficult to install XP without a CD-ROM drive. The main reason is that it can't boot with a USB external CD-ROM drive. I found that I need to press an F key. Fingerprints are annoying, matte ones are recommended. The keyboard needs to adapt, it feels far worse than my IBMT30. 
0	The appearance of the hotel is relatively magnificent, but the rooms are really shabby, the facilities are outdated, and the sanitation is average. However, there are fewer hotels in Daqing, and after searching, there are indeed no hotels. 
0	"Looking at everyone's comments on Ctrip, I booked a room with Yangmian 220 and went there. The result was disappointing, the lights were dim, the space was extremely small, the quality of the mattress was poor, and the room still had a musty smell. I was expected to stay last week, but I checked out after staying for one night. In fact, I thought it would be enough, maybe the price of this lot on the root of the imperial city can only be at this level. But the transfer was the next morning after I checked in. I walked out of the hotel and strolled on Xinjiekou Street. Within two minutes, I found a chain hotel-Xinyandu Main Store. The janitor's face was good, so he went in and looked at the room, and he liked it immediately. The design of the room is simple and stylish, spacious and bright, the bed is also very comfortable, and also has broadband. It is the type I like. I hurried back to the Huguosi Hotel and checked on Ctrip. The single room was only 200, and the suite was only 240. Great value! ! The same location, better conditions, and lower prices. Apart from anything else, he immediately placed a new order, checked out, and moved to Xinyandu with his luggage. Moreover, Xinyandu has more convenient transportation, just on Xinjiekou Street, with the bus station and taxi stand at the door. Diagonally opposite is Xinjiekou Supermarket and Xinjiekou Department Store, and the surroundings are also typical Beijing Hutongs. A reminder, ""Xinyandu"" does not have broadband on the Ctrip agreement, but in reality, ""Xinyandu"" does have it now. Having said so much, everyone should be very clear about how to choose. (I feel like a gunman, haha) In addition, I also hope that Huguosi Hotel can learn from competitors and make improvements. "
1	It's okay, you can't complain about the small room, because this is in Hong Kong, if you are shopping, it is a good choice! 
1	It is an excellent shopping hotel of choice. Lane Crawford and Harbour City are downstairs, but it takes 10 minutes to walk by subway. The room facilities and decorations are all obsolete. The smoking floor is very smelly. If you are not addicted to smoking, you must book a non-smoking floor. The standard of the buffet is indeed quite poor, which does not match the 200 yuan charge. 
0	The eyes of the masses are discerning. The service of this store is indeed very poor. Perhaps with the rapid development of tourism in Xikou, these hotels have the mentality of a nouveau riche and don't know what service is. At breakfast, a large group of waiters were at the entrance, but there was no one to attend to you, no cutlery, and a loud voice was required to have a little reaction. They came over and asked for meal coupons. There was nothing to eat at first glance. The meal coupon is torn up and not eaten. For people like me who lived in the mountains when I was a child, Xikou has no special value worth visiting. The transportation is inconvenient. I can only take a taxi from the airport and wait for 30 minutes to get a taxi. It is mostly deafening in Xikou. Sanwa is the basic means of transportation, and there will be no car when returning from the tomb of Chiang Kai-shek’s mother later (after 5 pm). I'm not here to travel. I think those who come to travel seem to be mostly officials (I don't know if it's the Communist Party or the Kuomintang). They may come here to learn from Jieshi how to balance warlords. This hotel does not have any advantages, but the new luxury hotel on the left is good, clean and refreshing, and many locals eat here. Don’t go to a restaurant by the river. There are two or three prices for the same dish. There are two or three prices on the same recipe. When you order it, it will be like braised bamboo shoots (18 yuan), and braised bamboo shoots (25 yuan) at checkout. ), you order the taro ribs (25 yuan), and you make the taro ribs (35 yuan) at the checkout. After learning, these neighbors from Xikou seem to have nothing more than passing on Lao Jiang's insidious cunning. Additional comments April 8, 2007: The service I chose was 1 point, how did it become 2 points? 
1	1. Small and exquisite, continuing the style of THINKPAD 2. The quality of the things is not said, but when they are delivered, they are brand new and unopened 3. Jingdong’s service is good, with invoices, and timely delivery 
1	I am 11 years old this year. I watched the first album at my brother’s house last year. I liked it very much. This time I set up two albums together to collect. The different Carmela gave us different fantasy. The stories inside made me feel like I was in it. In the middle of Camel, the aftertaste is endless, and the pictures that are accompanied by it evoke childhood memories, and I can't put it down. I have bought a lot of children's books of this type before, and many of them don't make much sense. Mela? In each story contains her own meaning, contains her own different dreams. Worth recommending! 
1	Our family of three stayed at Oceanwide Celebrity Hotel from July 19 to 22, 2008. We have also read online reviews before. With the mentality of giving it a try and a more professional vision of being engaged in aviation services, I truly appreciate the value for money and the well-deserved reputation. Whether it is a bright lobby, floor halls, or clean guest rooms, they are all decorated in a particularly elegant and comfortable style, full of the warmth of home. We stayed in a sea-view room on the fourth floor. It really faces the sea and the spring flowers are blooming. The windowsill is decorated with beautiful flowers and plants, and the sea is endless. The trestle bridge is close at hand, open the windows, and the gentle sea breeze is blowing in the face; close the windows, there is no trace of urban noise. Let us truly feel that we have come to Qingdao and truly enjoy the comfort of a sea view room. Especially the lobby managers of Oceanwide celebrities, tall girls with big eyes, are a bit like the youth version of Ni Ping, but more beautiful than the young Ni Ping. The attitude is particularly kind, and the service to the guests is particularly attentive. He can truly think what the guests think and be anxious. Particularly actively pay attention to the needs of the guests, understand and solve the difficulties for the guests in time. She is always smiling, polite and professional in her gestures and words. Even if it's only drizzling outside, she can be especially thoughtful and take the initiative to send umbrellas to guests. I think she can be an ambassador for Qingdao. She is beautiful and dignified, especially with the style and charm of traditional Chinese women. When I go to Qingdao again, I will live with a celebrity Oceanwide. I also hope that more friends will know this excellent, beautiful and generous lobby manager with oriental femininity. Thank you Fan Hai celebrities for giving us a wonderful holiday, and thank you for the excellent service of the lobby manager and floor attendant. Guests from Beijing 2008/08/01 
0	In fact, I was also a member of the official website who has read articles and waited impatiently. At that time, it was quite Ji Nan. After the exam, I hurriedly ordered a book on Dangdang.com. Seeing it in the middle of the night, I just want to say, I rely on. . . At the end of the story, I only feel bored, and feel that they are just a couple of people who have nothing to do. Sometimes the hero is very confused, and everyone has become accustomed to the virtue of the man in the small words. But the heroine, alas, it's unbearable to look back. It's enough to be on the throne of the most hated heroine in my works. . The text is not as exquisite as before, and there is no focus on sensationalism. The only thing I moved was the little girl who had a crush on Ji Nan. She proved from the side that Ji Nanfang is not a bastard, but at the same time, she reminded me of a good period like a dream 1. It was just a year or two ago. At that time, I was sincerely moved. Of course, some details in the article are good. But the details cannot frame a whole story. I can only say that I was quite disappointed. Now only the short stories of the I Love the Underworld series can be seen. 
0	It's not as good as the introduction, and I don't feel that it can make people feel awkward. In short, it is not good for memorizing words. 
1	"I only bought this book after reading the introduction. In fact, I didn't read many foreign books, especially books that are not masterpieces. I used to force myself to finish reading when I was reading a masterpiece. After historical verification, I can become a masterpiece, but I am impatient when I read it. Maybe it is still not used to their expressions. I watched ""Three Cups of Tea"" for 3 days. It should be regarded as my quick record of reading foreign books. I rarely remember the names of foreigners. I was just moved by his behavior. If you let me help others, it's very simple. But let me risk my life to help others, I am afraid I can't do it, maybe just this, he is great enough. "
1	Cheap price, at this price, the configuration should be said to be the best! I didn't find any shortcomings when I first started using it 
0	"The smell in the rooms and corridors is very heavy. The sound on the road outside the building is very noisy. The sound of the TV next door in the morning can be heard clearly and can be used as an alarm clock, but the time is set next door and the ""alarm clock"" is not timed. The invoice was not stamped for me when I checked the account. The general feeling is disappointing. Will not live again in the future. "
0	This book is not very well written. It seems that Du Lala is writing a diary. Many of the content has no substantive inspirational information. It is similar to the situation of ordinary company employees. It only emphasizes how Du Lala has developed step by step. , A bit like showing off your abilities. 
1	The price/performance ratio is good, the appearance is also good, there are many things to send, and I also used a 3000-150 coupon, which is very cost-effective 
1	I often visit this publishing house. I think their topics start from the basics. This book is divided into 3 points: main knowledge, click thinking, and zero-error training. I did the main knowledge before the preview. They are all basic questions and then click thinking. I review them at the end of the first lesson. They are also basic questions. It's just that some of the final zero-error training for reviewing concepts are done on weekends. . It’s a summary of the whole lesson. I’m quite satisfied. I don’t know what kind of textbook the person upstairs is. Doesn’t the Pythagorean version of the textbook have the Pythagorean theorem? ? 
0	We booked 4 rooms in Marriott on the Internet, which indicated that we arrived at noon, and we arrived on time. The front desk said that the room was not sanitary and had to be done later. So we went out for lunch and came back at 2pm. Room, the front desk said that the sanitation has not been done well, and only 3 rooms can be provided. We lost our temper. Can we do it for two hours? So the front desk changed us to another room that was already done. We need to lose our temper. We are here to travel, not to lose our temper. Obviously it is not a five-star, but five stars are marked on the sign, and then the five-star fee is provided, and the service and facilities of the two-star are provided, one word: bad! Additional comments October 8, 2007: It was marked to arrive at 12 noon, we also arrived on time 
0	"I am very afraid of many books that are ""considered as classics"", because many of them have too many artificial factors: like KFC and McDonald's, the best bought is not the best to eat. But because I wonder why it has so many good reviews, I bought it. As I feared, this book is really ""classic"". For me, his destination can only be the wastebasket or the second-hand book market. "
0	I bought Du Lala’s promotion note and sent it to my friend. My friend said that I haven’t received it yet, and I feel dizzy. ! ! 
0	Objectively speaking, it's just a little bit of my own experience and the accumulation of hard work. The professionalism and system are not enough, and the so-called empirical methods inside need further research. 
0	The bath towels are clean and new, and the towels are dirty to gray and black. The quilt is good, but there are almost no mattresses. Fortunately, TZ, who likes a hard bed, is definitely hard enough. The traffic is beside the main road between Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. The evaluation is: roadside store . I don’t know if I complained about the high commission for bringing in. The two rooms with the worst location (at the entrance of the restaurant on the first floor) were given. The actual hotel occupancy rate was not high on the day, so why bother. We leave more. I choose the hotel because of reviews and I rarely miss it. This time I went back with 2 big bags under my eyes (slightly). If you combine accommodation and vacation mood like me, it is best not to choose. I Don't ask for good hardware, as long as it is clean and warm, and you are willing to spend a little more money. In the future, just remember, you must live in a hotel officially listed by the Tourism Bureau!! All aspects are not formal, don't look at the photos, it is far from the actual situation. 
1	This novel opened up a scene to me. It was a quiet small street with low-rise houses on both sides. The afternoon sun was shining brightly on it. The air smelled of soap-washed bed sheets in the sun. A kind of sadness and truth, as if time is in front of you. And you are a bystander, passing through the years in a hurry, you can feel the real warmth, but it is truly vain. This feeling, I guess, is the same for Hannah to Misha, and Misha should be the same for Hannah. 
0	To be honest, I did not expect that this time Ctrip disappointed me too much. I have always believed in you. It may be that your company is now bigger, and the customers who have been silently supporting you are beginning to neglect, but to The service nature is the leading enterprise. What you have gradually discarded is not just a group of customers, but your corporate culture and corporate spirit. If you continue to do so, you can only gain market economic advantages by serving a company like yours; in such a fierce market economy, such Survival will be a fatal injury, take it seriously. The last day I stayed at the Jingdezhen Kaimenzi Hotel that you recommended was the worst four-star hotel in the country where I lived. Not only his hardware facilities and services could not be complimented, I was speechless, before leaving I left a message for their hotel, how can such a price and such a service be listed with 4 stars? How does the local tourism bureau review their level? You Ctrip is too irresponsible, how can you put such a hotel casually I recommend it to guests. The carpet in the room has water, and the surrounding carpets in the entire room are all white powder. The bathroom facilities are not as good as the facilities of a 200-year-old hotel in Wuyuan. You can see a lot inadvertently. The peeling wallpaper, you need to change into their sauna suits when you go swimming. In fact, you can go directly in on the first floor. After asking, I found out that the sauna was contracted out, dizzy! ! ! The guest room asked them to send a few disposable slippers and said that they would charge extra. My God, this is the first time I heard such a charge item in a four-star hotel. After the negotiation, I didn’t charge it. If you don’t say anything, you just believe Go try it once! ! ! The only thing I feel relieved is that the service in the hotel lobby is 3 stars. Ctrip, Ctrip, you must pay attention to it! 
0	The hotel room is small, the facilities are outdated, the hotel is on the road, the windows are not soundproof, which affects the rest 
1	"Although the price is more expensive than other similar brand products, it is lighter and shows better integration. The heat dissipation is also very good, and there is no obvious hot after use. After all, it is inherited from Xiaohei, which is worthy of praise! 1. The ""original leather bag"" presented at random is not like the original one, and it is not genuine leather-the label on it is Targus. I don't know what other friends think? I bought this original leather bag on JD. It’s a pity! 2. The same series of HT2 with fingerprint recognition, I hope JD.com will introduce it. 3. It is obviously difficult to run Vista with 1G memory, so I replaced it with 4G memory (50 yuan/piece cheaper) "
1	Generally speaking, it is not bad. I live on the 15th floor, and the water pressure in the bath is a bit low. Others are okay. It is a little far away from Longmen Grottoes, about 17 kilometers. The broadband speed is good. 
1	The decoration is simple and practical, but there are few power sockets. In addition, please match the hot faucet of the bathtub as shown in the picture. Hotel lobby is too big, breakfast has to go through hardships 
1	Quasi-four-star has been officially listed as four-star, the rooms are very large and clean, and the service is good. The hotel is right next to the train station and the transportation is very convenient. Moreover, large shopping malls such as Dashang are not far away, and shopping is very convenient. It is also because it is next to the train station that the hotel entrance looks messy 
1	The location is good, but it is a bit old, it is not a holiday, basically no reservation is required, the price is the same as the front desk. 
1	I stayed at the Pearl River Garden Hotel on December 20th for a few days. I felt pretty good. I was able to go to the beach when I went out. But I was hungry in the afternoon. The hotel didn’t have much food to eat. I didn’t even open when I went out. I felt quite uncomfortable. , But this hotel seems to be quite ok when I came here. Relative to this time, the price is not bad, and the room is not big enough, especially the balcony is too small. But next time I should consider staying in this hotel. Additional comments January 1, 2008: I don’t know why the 4 points I gave have jumped to 5 points. One thing to add, I only rate this hotel with 4 points. 
0	I bought this book for my parents. I heard it's easy to learn, so I showed them to my mothers and let them know some basic fitness methods, so that we will feel more at ease working outside. My mother is studying, and she said it was pretty good. 
0	For girls, it is indeed a bit heavy, and the noise of the fan makes me a little broken. Is it just a problem with this machine? Vista is still not used to it, and the 2G memory still makes me feel procrastinated... 
1	The appearance is good, the performance is excellent, the heat dissipation is ok, the temperature of the palm rest is not high, and the feeling is more comfortable 
1	2699, the price is invincible, it is 300 cheaper than the so-called lowest price I asked for. The performance is also very good. The standby time is under test, and it is impossible to be the same as the official 9.5 hours. 8 hours is not a big problem 
0	If you have worked in a foreign company, especially if you are a human resource in a foreign company, you will feel that what the author writes is not new, and the great principles that Lala talks about are all in the book. The author's description of the characters is too superficial, really disappointed. 
1	The advantages that others have said are all: suitable model, good heat dissipation, almost no noise, strong configuration, good keyboard feel, better graphics card, timely delivery 
1	Book the hotel through Ctrip and keep it until 6 pm. However, I received a call from Ctrip more than 3 in the afternoon and said that I called the hotel to cancel my room and asked me if there was anything like this. Simply annoying! Later when I checked in at the hotel, I asked the front desk if there was anything like this. They actually answered very simply, there is this thing. The hotel is too irresponsible and cancels guests' reservations at will for their own occupancy rate. Not worthy of Renaissance style and professional ethics. In addition, the hotel cannot use Minsheng Bank credit cards for pre-authorization, only Bank of China and Bank of Communications. This is very inconvenient, so please pay attention to it when you check in in the future. 
1	Finally adjusted to the new wing, which is their newly decorated floor. Not bad, the bathroom is large, and the breakfast is rich, but quite expensive :) 
0	The content is general, and relevant reminders can be obtained on websites and other channels. . . The paper is okay, the characters are big, it's too wasteful 
1	The geographical position is superior, and it is convenient to go everywhere. The room is relatively small, but the view and hygiene are good. Very quiet, surrounded by old residential areas, quite distinctive. Service attitude is good. I should choose here next time I go! 
0	The only uncomfortable thing is that I found a bright spot, but fortunately, the price is there! 
1	Good heat dissipation.. Looks handsome.. Performance is also good. The shape has a business style. The little red dot is good, I have been using it. And the original mouse feels very good.. 
1	Thinkpad's brand appeal is very good. After Lenovo acquired the ibm pc division, it put all business jet research and development on the Thinkpad brand. Professional is good! 
0	The VISTA system is difficult to operate. I’m not used to it. The piano paint is high-end but it has to be equipped with a film. The most important thing is that the three letters of IBM are missing. I always feel that it is a pity that IBM does not do it. ! ! 
0	The fan has a louder sound; it is inconvenient to disassemble the keyboard to add memory and replace the hard disk by yourself; it takes a certain skill to reinstall the keyboard. 
0	After receiving the freight forwarder, I took a look. The printing of the book pages is still quite clear. The cover and the pictures on the Internet are the same. But when I opened it for the second time, the cover was opened and the edges were folded without breaking, but the cracks in the crease were obvious. The quality of the cover paper was too bad. Because I wanted to give it away, I wrote a few words on the paper inside. Unexpectedly, it was overcast. -! I bought a lot of books on Dangdang, the price is really affordable, but the quality is, alas, is it cheap but not good? 
1	There are some book writers who try to complicate simple things as much as possible, lest others read them, lest they don’t know the level of unpredictability; some writers try to simplify complicated things as much as possible, lest others can’t. Know the meaning, try to explain it in a simple way, and simply reason. As a reader, I hate the first type of writer the most, and most welcome the second type of writer. The author of this book is the second type of book writer I like. The whole book looks smooth, comfortable, and very beneficial. It may also depend on the translator's fluent translation, which allows the original author's meaning to be expressed fluently. 
1	"Once I saw this book accidentally, it became a must-read every night before going to bed. The book has text introductions and illustrated case analysis and hints. It is the most ""child-centered"" book among all the books I have read. Because I thought it was very good, I recommended and ordered a copy for all parents in the class. Not only I thought it was good, but everyone also thought it was good. It is recommended that parents with children, kindergarten and elementary school teachers must take a look! Maybe it can help everyone re-examine their educational concepts and behaviors, and it will definitely help your child's growth. "
0	"The whole book gave me the feeling that after a peasant became rich, he was afraid that others would become rich and squeezed his position. But I don't want to expose my fearful thoughts so obviously, so I use the word ""fair"" to neutralize it. ""Fairness"" is not used like this! Not recommended to buy. If someone who is really curious wants to buy it, I sell this second-hand copy in my hand and contact me. "
0	I bought it back. I wanted to see it for myself before telling it to my child, but the pungent smell has already caused a headache, so I didn't dare to show it to my child! 
1	I played in the Ocean Park for a day, and brought my tired body to the hotel in Admiralty. I thought it would be expensive, but it is not very expensive, because I called the lady at the front desk before I came. How did Admiralty get to the hotel. The front desk told me that I could get there by 5B, but after I got off the bus at Admiralty, I didn’t know where to find a station where I could take 5B, so if I was cruel, I called it, which is 27 yuan and I can get to the hotel. . Arriving at the hotel, the lady at the front desk spoke mildly, and the speed was quite fast. When all the procedures were completed, she told me softly: Has helped you upgrade to an executive room. At that moment there was ecstasy in my heart. When I got to the room, the inside was not bad. Although it was not very big, it was not as small as I imagined (because I have been to Hong Kong a few times before, and we have lived in the small one). Outside the window is a residential building and you can see the sea. The toilets are also quite clean. Put your luggage and go downstairs to find food. There are several small shops nearby that are not closed. A bowl of wonton noodles at ten yuan is a low cost in Hong Kong. The taste is okay. When I went down to look at it during the day, it turned out that the street was a vegetable market. As a housewife, I also compared the prices. It turns out that our prices are really too high. Some things are actually the same price as ours. However, their income is N times ours. Don't say it. Overall, this hotel is okay in every way. If I have a chance to go to Hong Kong, I will choose this hotel. But I just think the price of the hotel is a little bit higher (HK715). Maybe it’s the reason for summer vacation. And the daily price is different, a bit like seafood price. 
0	The USB interface is designed to overlap up and down, which is too compact and the USB device cannot be too thick. The optical drive is noisy. The hard disk is noisy. Adjust the disk performance to the highest performance in the BIOS to enable SATAII and ATA133. At this time, the noise can be reduced a little bit (it is recommended to use Western Digital hard disk). 
1	I bought this book after reading the reviews, because I don’t know if my baby likes it or not. My baby is only 1 year and 3 months old. As soon as the book arrived, he took Gulugulu and showed him it. Who knows he couldn’t put it down, not only let me talk about it every day, but also compared his toy car with the car on the book, watching me make an ahhhh, what he meant Maybe my car is not in the book? He doesn't speak much yet. Now I like to watch cars when I walk on the road. Whether it's a taxi, bus, motorcycle, car, crane, or truck, he uses his finger to show me. What a good set of books.

0	Check-in record of Xinxiang National Hotel: 1. When I checked into the first room, the TV could not be turned off and it was always on. The waiter suggested changing rooms. 2. The air conditioner in the changed room is not good, and the room is changed again. We ran with our luggage. 3. The third room we changed is a smoking room. We asked: Is there a non-smoking room? The waiter told us: I just need to take the ashtray away. Dumbfounding! 4. Go to the restaurant hall for dinner in the evening. After ordering the meal, the waiter informs: The minimum consumption is 35 yuan per person. We couldn't understand, the waiter informed: the hotel's new regulations. After the telephone complaint, the visitor said: The waiter is new and does not know. 
1	I bought 2 sets at once, and my colleagues had one by themselves. . . feels pretty good in general. . The battery is durable, the screen is good, and the keyboard is easy to use. 
0	If you are idle and bored, you can read this book in one go, because readers want to know what the author wants to write and what the result is. However, Bi Shumin's literary accomplishment is still too far away. Real literary lovers must be disappointed in this life. The dialogues of everyone in the book are exactly the same, there is no personality, and it will never be a book that will last forever. The author might as well write a few psychological analysis cases directly, rather than writing them as literary works so far-fetched. 
1	The classics are classics. They are pretty good. Every day, my daughter will show it and learn a lot of new words. I read it to her the first time. I read it to her emotionally at the time, and she read it to her emotionally. I listen! I really hope that all children's popular science books can be as interesting as this set of books and are suitable for children's psychology! Awesome! ! ! 
0	I bought it on June 20. On June 26, it was found that the black plastic casing at the bottom right of the screen and the connection point of the screen had a very serious degumming phenomenon. Looking for after-sales theory, they passed the responsibility to the manufacturer, and they are really not responsible! 
1	The appearance design is good, the workmanship is exquisite, and the speed of JD Express is also very fast, especially the price of 2699-100 is impeccable! 
1	The location is very close to our unit. From the price point of view, the price is very good. I want a double bed room, 168 yuan, the front desk staff is very good, the room hardware is average, but think about the price is that. It is clean, that is The mattress is too hard. BTW: There is no harassment of the phone, this is a good supplementary review March 4, 2008: By the way, free Internet access here, just work overtime online, very good 
1	"What should a veteran look like? The grumpy Shi Guangrong, the stubborn Guzidi, the rude and bold Li Yunlong, they are indeed wonderful on the screen, but the Wang Sanguan and Ge Erdan in the veteran story will make you unforgettable, especially Ge Erdan is absolutely amazing. I don’t know how others reacted when watching his story? Anyway, I was cramping with a smile. A ""wise"" peasant, a typical ""second-rate"" hero, in that special era, his performance was unusual, but outstanding. If he lived today, what would he look like? I can't think about it, but maybe it's also a hero! "
0	"When staying in the big bed room on the 11th floor, there is a clear musty smell from the carpet as soon as you get out of the elevator; the windows of the room cannot be opened. Even so, there are mosquitoes. The most terrifying thing is that there is a spiritual event. Stayed for 2 nights, the first day was fine; the next day, at 3 in the morning, I was awakened by the sound of ""di"" and ""di"". When I saw that the desktop computer in the room started automatically, I read the CD after that, but it failed. Scream. In the past, I could not turn off the computer by pressing the power button, so I had to unplug it. However, I always use my own laptop, and I have never touched this desktop. Really will never go to the hotel again. "
0	The room is relatively poor, especially the bathroom, the soundproofing of the room and the food service are not good. 
0	After reading the online introduction, I bought this book. I was dumbfounded. It was too young to read. Our child didn’t look it right. What should I do? The customer service is busy...I wonder if it is a fake You should pay attention to online shopping in the future. 
0	This book is suitable for children aged 3 to 5 years old. My son has been able to listen to and read, and now he can tell me vividly, not bad 
0	Strongly not recommended. I ordered a luxury room. When I arrived at the front desk, I actually said that I didn’t make a reservation. I was frustrated for a long time. I didn’t have a good service attitude when staying in a hotel on a business trip. I was really unhappy. Then I went upstairs to the 5th floor. The elevator didn’t know how it broke. Now, when asked what to do about the service desk and whether it can be repaired, she said coldly: Climb the stairs! I have a big baggage! The room is relatively small, and the cleanliness is average. It is far from the introduction. For example, the bath towels are all broken and shredded. They are very disgusting. The TV remote control is not easy to use, and I need to work. Those who use the Internet, but promised to have a network cable in the room, there is indeed a network cable, but can not be connected to the Internet for three days, the phone to the front desk, either said that there is no problem, or that the machine is broken, can not be repaired today, have to wait for tomorrow. If it weren't for the points I have already set, I would have replaced it a long time ago, which would be very uncomfortable. There are many hotels in the surrounding area, so we advise you to think twice before staying and choose those with better reputation and better stars. Additional comments July 1, 2008: The breakfast provided is really not eatable, and the soundproofing effect of the room is extremely poor. The corridors are added up and down, and the sound is super annoying, which seriously affects the rest! 
1	Checked in at the end of May. The decoration of the room feels pretty good, but the room is a bit small, the big bed is actually two beds together, which is a bit strange. The location is good, facing the Convention and Exhibition Center, it is only four roads away from Wanchai MTR station, and the bars on Lockhart Road are also relatively close. Especially if you go to Kowloon, you will go downstairs to the Ferry Pier, which is very convenient. The hotel will send a small toy every day, although it is very simple, but a few days to gather together can put a lot of shapes, have been playing until now, I don't know if it will be sent next time. The restaurant in the hotel is relatively average and the price is expensive. It is better to go to the subway station Lockhart Road or the few tea restaurants on Kebu Da Road for the affordable. The swimming pool is very good, but the opening time is a bit short. It would be better if the luminous field is also opened at night. The checkout in the lobby is weird. When you cancel the credit card line at the checkout, you can't tear up the small ticket. The usual practice of this hotel... or Hong Kong's practice? 
1	Low price, medium performance, because it does not require high configuration, I fancy this model is a business model, I believe in workmanship, so choose this model 
1	I spent the whole year reading workplace novels last year and may not be able to quit. I don't know what choice Fang Fei will make in this return, ha ha. . . Perhaps what I care most is her emotional belonging. The same is true for women no matter how strong they are, they all need a home. Personally, I still prefer swordsmen, because I feel that 95% of swordsmen are Ling Yuan. His affection for the past few years cannot be disappointed. They are all loving people, why not be together. I think people in heaven and people in the world all hope to see this result! May lovers finally get married! 
0	There are only 2 USB ports, too few to connect too many external devices! Dirt is easy to leave on the surface! 
0	The heat sink is very hot, you can heat the water cup, maybe AMD's CPU has this virtue, it is very troublesome to reinstall the XP system 
1	The heat dissipation effect is good, the power consumption is very low, the configuration is high, the sound is very small during operation, and the screen is quite comfortable. 
1	The screen is bright and online. The video playback is smooth and stable. The Blu-ray disc in the external DVD drive with PowerDVD8.0 is also very clear and smooth, thanks to the 9300GS. The 6-cell battery guarantees more than 3 hours of use, with low sound and low heat. After I got it, I changed the 320G hard drive and installed XP very smoothly. The speed is much faster than Vista. It is quite difficult for Jingdong to buy LCD protective film self-adhesive. I was in a hurry and bought another keyboard protective film. HDMI output audio and video no problem 
1	The new style is quite exquisite, which conceals the small inherent inadequacy of the room, but some details are not yet thoughtful, such as the electric kettle for boiling water. The plastic smell is very heavy. I am afraid it is a substandard product. 
1	The service is very good, I hope it’s not just in time for the Olympics. There are people leading the way everywhere. You feel at home! The breakfast is fairly rich, and there are many restaurants at the door. The beach is just outside. The scenery is beautiful. Worth staying! 
0	It is very convenient and very affordable to buy a book online in Dangdang for the first time! As soon as the child receives the book, he will read it with love. It is a good set of books, in the happy children's story, let the child learn to be a character, caring and helpful child. 
1	Very cost-effective! Similar books are 500 to 1000 yuan higher than this one, so friends who want to buy books hurry up! 
0	The Hongzhan building booked by Ctrip during the November period is said to be a four-star hotel on the Internet. It doesn’t look like it when I go to the place. Ask the waiter if this is a four-star hotel? She said, yes, and pointed to the four red five-stars cut out of red tape on the door. This is four stars, I am faint. The lobby staff explained that the Guest House is a four-star hotel, and the Hongzhan Building is an annex building. There is no four-star. The room is large, the equipment is very old, and the bed linen is very old. But the price is not expensive, 178 per day. The breakfast was not very good, the milk did not taste milk, and the tableware was not too clean. However, this hotel should not be underestimated. There is a picture album in each room, which is full of Zhu Rongji, Li Peng, and Jing Shuping. Additional comments October 7, 2007: Hotel parking fees are charged, this is the first time I encountered. 
0	It’s a bit hot, it’s troublesome to install XP, and the driver is hard to find. It’s best to buy a painted protective film with a shell 
1	International five-star hotel couple professional hotel evaluation (TT): First of all, I did not book the Emeishan Hotel, but escaped from the Emeishan Tianyi Hot Spring Resort Hotel. Hotel location: 5 minutes, at the foot of Mount Emei, 80 meters away from the passenger center, very good location~! You can take a hot bath right away from the ice and snow on Mount Emei. It is recommended. Hotel environment: 4 points, full standard 4-star hotel, you can overlook Mount Emei from the hotel, and the hotel environment is also good. Hotel rooms: 4 points, the hotel facilities are slightly outdated, after all, it has been opened for a long time, but overall it is not bad. Hotel service: 4 points, people always pull in the door, and the front desk attitude is also good, that is, the credit card pre-authorization is cancelled when checking out, and the consumption has been cancelled, which has been unsuccessful, so the basic skills need more training. Free breakfast: 3 points, breakfast in the banquet hall, overall is much better than Tianyi. In general, a four-star hotel with modest performance, the hotel is a bit outdated, which can also be reflected in the hotel basically only standard rooms and few double-bed rooms, but the price is good compared with the price of 390. 
0	The built-in VISTA system is too stinky. It takes 10 minutes to boot up and 20 minutes to shut down. It is very slow and depressed. I have reinstalled XP now, and I just bought it for less than 10 days. Hey. . . . Speechless 
1	It's only used for work and surfing the Internet. It's pretty good. It has no redundant functions and looks more formal! 
1	Okay, affordable. Hotel feedback April 17, 2008: Thank you! Welcome to the Chevalier Hotel again. 
0	The indicator light is green, and it doesn’t feel very good with the gray tone. Of course, this is a personal opinion. The CD-ROM drive sounds very loud and clammy. The camera is very inferior, and the image is blurred. There is also a worry that the shell is easy to wear or peel off The system is very troublesome and I realize so much, but I have to slowly realize it 
0	I ordered this book through the introduction on the Internet, but after reading a few pages, I felt a kind of foolish feeling. The introduction on the Internet was a big overstatement, and the content in the book was very boring and not interesting at all. Sex can be discussed, even someone like me who loves English can't read it, let alone the elderly and children. However, the quality of the book is very good. 
1	I like this hotel. I stayed in many years ago, and then I stayed in other hotels. I feel that it is still good. I think it is very cost-effective. Especially better than the surrounding environment, the scenery is beautiful, and it is only a few minutes walk to eat out. There is also a small commercial area, such as Baijia, Jusco, etc. It is very convenient. Although it is a few tens of yuan away from the big shopping area such as Harbour City, if you are willing to wait, there is a free bus provided by the hotel, 30 It is very convenient to get to Tsim Sha Tsui every minute. Also, the day of check-in coincided with my birthday, and the waiter said happy birthday to me when I checked in at the lobby, and delivered delicious cakes in the evening, a very beautiful one Red roses and foreign wine. Very happy. Also, because we went early that day, we were allowed to check in at 11 o'clock. In short, this stay, there is nothing dissatisfied with. 
0	This hotel sucks. In particular, the service is very poor, and it's just irritating. I booked breakfast through Ctrip, but I was told that it would not start until 7 o'clock. Then I said I would return it, but I told me that I can’t return once I ordered it. I called the front desk in the morning to check the room. After I arrived at the front desk, the front desk hadn't called yet. When I said to check out again, I called back slowly, but after waiting a few minutes, no one checked. When I signed the order, I realized that the two words of my name had been inverted. I really didn't understand. I couldn't flatter me, and inexplicably, another person's name appeared behind my name. It is recommended that you do not stay. So I scored two points for the service because the restaurant gave me a bowl of ginger soup, which was quite touched, otherwise the service would definitely be a point. 
1	I bought it at the 4599 special. After 10 days, it is now 100 yuan cheaper. At that time, HP541CPU was considered to be 1 point higher. Although the bus is only 1M, the other is 2M, the graphics card is 128BIT, this is 64BIT, but I believe this brand, and it is mainly ordinary office games 
0	"I chose to stay at the Swan Hotel after checking the reviews, but I was disappointed. After our car arrived at the hotel entrance, the baggage guard stared at us, but did not take the initiative to help with the luggage. I walked over and asked him, ""Is there no baggage guard in the hotel?"" As soon as I opened the door of the guest room, a foul smell came out, disgusting. The room is very old, and the soundproofing is very poor. I don't know what motor or equipment is running. The sound is roaring and stopping for a while, and there is the sound of heavy objects from time to time. Anyway, it is too noisy to sleep all night. Get up and check out at 6 o'clock the next morning. It turned out that we had paid a deposit of 2 nights and planned to stay one more day. Due to frequent business trips due to work, this hotel is the worst hotel I have stayed in more than ten years. It is hard to imagine that the hardware facilities and services of a four-star hotel are not as good as those of ordinary guest houses. "
1	The 158 room I stayed in was okay, the room was facing the road at the entrance of the hotel, soundproofing was ok, not noisy. The bathroom was not too small, but the design was not very reasonable, the shower faucet was too powerful, and the water hit the body It all hurts. Overall, it's okay. 
0	Disappointed! I thought it was a book with specific reading content! There was no result at all! I flipped it a bit and threw it aside! Failed purchase! 
0	I am somewhat resistant to this book. The pictures are all terrible, and it feels better not to show them to children. . . . . . 
1	I finished this book in only four days, which is rare in my reading life. Although this book has been nine years since its publication, it still feels fresh and I have learned a lot from it. For example, why does the country implement protective price purchases of agricultural products? Of course, some personal opinions are not necessarily correct, and economists are not an omniscient God. The text is vivid and lively, and it does not feel esoteric at all. It is a real popular economics. The printing quality of the book is very good, with some interesting illustrations, it is a good book. 
1	Close to Gongbei Pass, the standard room is too small, the deluxe bed is good, and the service is good. 
0	There is a scratch on the left side of the notebook during transportation. In addition, the notebook should be sent with an original mouse. Sending garbage to Rising is too wasteful of value. Otherwise, the price of 199 yuan would be better. Anyway, I will not use Rising's rubbish software when it expires. The bare skin is beautiful, but the inside is empty. 
1	The venue is light and thin, with only the weight of a general notebook; the keyboard feels very good, with good key travel and flexibility; the LED display is good, and there is no reflection in all directions. 
0	Why are some keyboards misaligned under the English input method? The reason is currently being sought. . . It's not a problem with the keyboard. . . 
1	I have always liked Jiangnan and the exquisiteness of his words. I have also been collecting Jiangnan's books, and this one is no different. When I first saw it, I didn’t like it very much. I couldn’t find the previous Jiangnan style. Zhuolu is more like a combination of the boy and the 缥缈lu here, but I think it’s a little bit different, but I still insist on seeing the back. Gradually found Jiangnan in memory. I like Chi You in his writings, he became a mad demon for Yunjin, even if he didn’t mind, he has been nostalgic for the world because of Yunjin~~ 
1	Recently, a few friends and I went to Yangzhou on a self-driving trip. I was introduced by my friends to live in the new century. First, I feel that the parking lot is very large and can park about 300-400 cars at the same time. The comfort of the room is very good, and the sound insulation effect is also good. The hotel has recently been renovated, and the overall feeling is pretty good. The hotel’s service is in place and value for money. Dinner in the evening coincides with their food festival. I heard that there are several times a year, which is really good! 
0	Seeing so many people buying, I also bought a book. The content is very empty, and I regret that there are not many substantive items. I should not blindly follow the trend. Because I tried to buy a book for the first time in Dangdang, I feel that the speed is good, and the order is within 3 days. The goods arrived. The overall feeling is a little slower than the excellent, but the express service attitude is a little better. The only good thing is that the express fee is free 
0	No shortcomings have been found yet! No camera, but reserved, but the camera does not seem to have a lot of money 
1	A book with a very high sexual price, the evil v system. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
1	This time I went to Quanzhou with three foreign guests and stayed in Quanjiu. The lobby is decorated with daffodils and has a delicate fragrance. The environment is very good. Checked in at a price of 390 yuan, great value. Guests praised the hotel as very good, I think this It is the same feeling of every staying guest. 
1	Cheap and affordable; better configuration; workmanship is OK; in such a cheap situation, it also has a built-in wireless network card 
0	Basically there are no shortcomings, because his shortcomings are the shortcomings of all notebooks: why can't the hardware be upgraded so that it will never be out of date? (Basically a dream) 
1	Beautiful appearance, good performance, and very good running XP. The screen is super bright. The first time I bought Gateway, it was recommended by others, but I didn't expect it to be really good. 
1	The only four-star hotel in the technical zone, the appearance is unremarkable, but the service feels very good, especially 
0	"I flipped it casually. The cover is fancy, and the font inside the book is very large, which can almost be described as ""great"". Contents, I guess I can only serve as a footrest in the future. I unanimously believe that everything that is popular, fancy, and praised by everyone requires the greatest suspicion and caution. I bought too many things this time, and the light of reason did not shine on the impulsive sensibility. I still added a burden or a tasteless to my originally small room! These two books have very high reviews in Dangdang, very good. I suspect that Dangdang entrusted the pages of these two books to pretend to be customer hype. Of course, I just doubt it. If you need to read these two books, it is recommended to borrow them in the library. It is unnecessary to buy them for collection and slowly absorb reading. This is my personal opinion. Please learn from yourself. Anyway, I bought the table legs in my house for 20 yuan. "
1	I admire Hu Xueyan's high emotional intelligence, broad mind, and uprightness in handling things. This is the talent, the talent to do things, the talent to speak, and the most important thing is the eagerness that cannot be learned. The final outcome can only be said to be a victim of political struggle. Not only official business, businessmen in China, as long as they become bigger and stronger, it is impossible to draw a clear line from politics. Rather than being used, it is better to use each other, or a win-win situation. Hu Xueyan happened to be in troubled times. If in such a peaceful period, the ending would definitely be rewritten. 
1	"This is the second Hoshino Sakura novel I bought. The first is ""Empty Miles"". Although this is not a traversal, it is still quite a good book, the plot is very funny, the author thinks of things that many people can't think of. Even so, it feels a little bit worse than ""Empty Miles"". I personally feel that the details of ""Empty Miles"" are well written, and many places can flow out in detail. At this point, I feel that ""Great Dragon Gate"" owes a little bit. . But it doesn't matter, it doesn't affect the whole novel. If you like the style of ""Empty Miles"", I recommend you buy this book. "
1	This is a value-for-money three-star hotel with complete facilities including bathroom towels/hair dryers, etc. The house is newly decorated. The service attitude is as good as a smile at the front desk. The service is good. Located in the city center but facing the street and noisy, the room sound insulation is not good .Breakfast is average. Additional review September 4, 2007: The price of the house is moderate, but there is no price advantage for the booking of the hotel. The front desk price of the hotel is the same as that of the hotel. 
0	The book I bought the day before yesterday has been dropped today. Is it a bit too unreasonable? Can you give me an explanation, or I will reject it and buy it again! 
0	The condition of the room is so bad, it completely wastes the powerful location close to Shichahai and Beihai. Perhaps the positioning is to serve those tourists who come here, all conditions are quite poor, at best it is a guest house level. 
1	The boss has to book this hotel every time he travels to Beijing, he is very satisfied with it 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, the size is small, it is enough for work and Internet. Very cost-effective. My girlfriend saw it and liked it very much. He wanted to buy the fuchsia 1000H with small flowers, and hope that Jingdong can provide this model. 
0	JD’s customer service expertise needs to be improved. The configuration of the notebook is not clear. It will be said that there is HDMI for a while, and that it is not. The original bag sent is very rubbish, it can only be a normal computer bag, please don't say it is an original bag, misleading consumers, we are selling 3699 Metro here. The price can be cheaper. 
1	Although the software of this hp machine is a bit lacking, I made a call to HP headquarters and immediately sent the required drivers to the mailbox. After installing it, I found that this machine is quite easy to use, other aspects are very good, and the appearance is pretty good. Fashionable and atmospheric, add memory in a few days, it will be more perfect. Hehe. . 
0	The disc is found to be cracked and cannot be used. I have contacted Dangdang Customer Service Center to apply for a replacement. It should be sent back to Dangdang Customer Department with the book on the 14th, but there is no news yet, please confirm Dangdang as soon as possible. 
0	The VISTA system runs with 2G memory, but it’s still a bit slow. Among the things delivered, Rising Antivirus is a bit tasteless. If it can be replaced with other more useful things: such as headphones, it’s more appropriate 
1	Reading Mr. Nan's book is like walking in the fog and suddenly seeing a light in front of you pulling you far away, making your heart feel refreshed. There is so much we want to know about life and the world. Things, this set of books will give us a lot of enlightenment, and I believe everyone will get something after reading it. Although many of the contents of this set of books have been read on the Internet, I am still very eager to buy a set of my own collection, and then take it out at any time to read carefully. I personally feel that buying this set of books is really worth it, and I can touch it in the vast sea of books. I really feel lucky to be here! 
1	The front desk and floor attendants are good, the room is quiet and tidy, the transportation is convenient, and there are plenty of places to eat. The only shortcoming is that the bathroom floor drain is not well designed, resulting in a small amount of water. 
1	The environment is not bad. My sister and the others have designated the place to live and have lived many times. I like it. . . 
1	This set of books is really good. In addition to the printing and paper quality, there are also small loose-leaf pages that can be turned around to express the actions and plots of the characters in the story. It is really very vivid. The protagonists inside: hippopotamus, pig, little mouse and little crocodile are deeply loved by children. I remember that when the book was first bought, she was always clamoring to read it to her. This set of books has been bought for more than half a year, and the corners and corners have been ripped up. Now I came up to write a review. I wanted to make it more negative. Responsibly write the comments after use and let other moms refer to them. When the child is one and a half years old, it is recommended to buy this set of books for him (her). 
1	1 Compared with my previous ibmx31, the keyboard keys are looser, but it seems to be easier to type with less effort. 2 Random vista is also good. Just get used to it. 3 It feels good. The style of ibm. The characteristics of Lenovo. The Chinese people’s victory. 4 The atmosphere is reasonably configured. The video and audio are excellent. 5 Jingdong’s delivery lads are very cute and I suggest giving them processing money. 
0	The inner bag provided is relatively poor. Due to the battery, the weight is slightly heavier. The design is not prominent, but it is still not integrated. The biggest problem is the upgrade. There is no spare memory expansion slot. If you upgrade, Need to use 2G sliver to replace the built-in 1G sliver, very bad! ! 
1	Generally speaking, it is quite satisfactory. The heat dissipation is quite good, the noise is not too big, and VISTA runs smoothly. 
0	It's too old and the room facilities are poor. I also saw cockroaches in the bathroom. And there is a KTV in the hotel, it is very noisy to sleep at night! 
1	Where was the concierge when I checked in? The flower pots in the room were very ugly like those in the early 90s. What's more frightening was that when I checked in, I didn't care about the guests at the door, and we would do extensive cleaning as usual. 
0	Although I bought it, it was delivered in the end, but I was very angry. Every time I ordered a book, it took a long time to deliver it. In a big city like Guangzhou, it took almost half a month to deliver it in the city center. , You say I am not angry. 
1	It is compact and has good heat dissipation. It is very portable for ladies and is much lighter than the company's hp. The vista system that comes with it uses the complimentary memory stick a bit faster. The problem is not found yet, but the sound feels too small. 
1	Things are very good, performance and appearance are very impressive. It’s very good. It’s just a blue screen when installing the system. Later, I found a solution on the Lenovo website. I had to turn off one of the hard drives. I don’t remember what it was called. Just go to the Internet to see it. 
1	I stayed at St. Regis Hongta again on December 1st. The service is still very good, but I can't feel the knowing smile I had before. However, the swimming pool at Regis Hongta is as good as ever 
0	I just bought it after reading the reviews. After reading a book, I can’t feel that it is good. I don’t think it is suitable for Chinese babies. And my son is only 8 months old. Wait for him to be older. 
1	It is very close to the airport, 15 minutes, less than 20 yuan, but it is too far from the city, and there is a barren road in the middle, there is a Yichu lotus next to it, there is also a Pearl Plaza, the environment is still good, the rooms are also Row. Ctrip's price is very uncompetitive. My friend and I stayed at the same time. My room rate was 548. My friend booked through her company and the room rate was only 410. 
0	The room is covered with cheap stone tiles like a restaurant, and there is a dirty carpet between the two beds. There is only a thin mattress on the bed, and the springs on the mattress will be on you at all times. The water from the sprinklers always has only two temperatures, extremely hot and extremely cold. It is inconvenient to travel and the location is rather biased. Many drivers will not go to take a taxi from Jiefangbei. All in all terrible 
0	1 Piano paint, easy to scratch, and obvious scars 2 The partitions are indeed very BT 3 The time drive will make a rubbing sound when the machine is turned on and off 
0	"I like Zhang Ailing so much, I bought the complete works, and ""Break and Hollow Love"". I bought this book just to learn more about Ailing. Somewhat disappointed. Inexplicably sad, I imagined Ai Ling should be a golden branch and jade leaf. Although she was suffering from the wind and dust, she was also pure and clean. She didn't want to meet Hu Lancheng, such a vulgar demon king. I remember reading a book by He Kun. Although he is a big corrupt official, he also has a kind of admiration for his wife Feng with affection and intention, beginning and end. In the end, Aileen wandered for half her life, and died in depression. Birth is not in time! "
0	"As the child grows up, this book has become the child's favorite (1 year and 7 months), and it is necessary before going to bed for more than 2 months. The child’s favorite is the last page. Sometimes when I talk, I turn to the end all at once. When I said David’s mother said ""I love you"", the baby girl also looked up and waited for me to say ""I love you."" "" "
0	I was very happy, but after reading a part of the book, I found that 6 pages were blank? ! Dizzy, I'm so angry, buying books online is risky 
1	From the perspective of organizational growth, the four masterpieces have a division of labor. The Journey to the West talks about organizations in the initial stage, and how to survive is the most important; The Romance of the Three Kingdoms talks about large national organizations, how strong and monopoly is the main thing. The key point is how to be strong; the Dream of Red Mansions is about family organizations, and the most important thing is how to maintain and continue. In comparison, the Water Margin preached the problem of how small organizations can become large organizations. Shantou and sects all have growth requirements, so this book talks about how to grow. Its wisdom is here. 
0	6 cores to 3 cores! ! ! Jingdong said to send gift bags? ? The system installation is troublesome, and the workmanship is a bit poor. Those two switches (power supply, wireless) are like toy switches, and the OEM system is not expensive. You should consider using the XP version! The bottom is so hot! The LED indicator is dazzling! 
0	When the hard disk reads data frequently, there is a slight card noise. It is better to change the processor to t6400, and the price can be lowered. 
0	Although the screen is excellent, but the color system is warmer, some people may not be used to it. The USB design is not very reasonable. All of them are side by side. This shortcoming Sony has not changed since SR1, which is rather disappointing. There is a large gap at the optical drive. 
0	After reading it, I found the gap, but if I choose again, I still won’t change. I still have to walk on my own and walk steadily. This book is not as good as I imagined~ 
0	I ordered a deluxe double room. I found that the room is very small and the soundproofing is not good. The room is connected to the Internet, and it is always falling off. Someone claims to be from the Changsha Public Security Bureau to break into my colleague after 1 o’clock in the middle of the night. I called my colleague’s room and said my colleague’s name, ID number or something, and then asked my colleague for his family’s contact information or something. A typical liar~~~ I don’t know how this information was leaked out, too I doubted this hotel, so I immediately changed to the Heyi International Hotel on the second day. There used to be a Ctrip agreement hotel, but it is not anymore, but it is only around 230, which is much better than here. , It’s better to go directly to Heyi, the traffic is good, and it’s also bustling 
0	Want to change my review of this book! ! Because of it! ! I read this book carefully again! ! By the way, this book was recommended by the teacher! ! It was really boring to read before! ! BUT! ! Now I find that although the style is not suitable for me, the writing should be ok! ! 
0	The left side of the keyboard is really hot. . . . Because the speaker is under the keyboard, the sound is very small. . The LED screen seems to have a tailing phenomenon, but the static picture is very clear. Oh, I haven't found any software in which to set the fingerprint. 
0	I bought a set of very thin torn paper boxes. My colleague bought a hard box packaging. Can Dangdang give a reasonable explanation? 
0	I like Bi Shumin's book, except for female psychologists. I know that the author has a deep understanding of psychology, so I want to buy the book. Who knows that it is disappointing to read the upper part. The cases and characters in the book are too bizarre and a bit deviating Ordinary public life, maybe the author wants to describe psychologists and psychological counseling more deeply and professionally, so that more people can understand this new subject, but reading the book makes people feel that psychological counseling is far from me. It's too far away, I feel that those of us who have experienced mediocre thinking and mediocre thinking are not in line with psychological counseling, ha ha, just said a few words, it is completely personal feeling! 
1	A very good nutritional recipe, which gives the nutritional indicators that the baby needs every month, so that I can refer to it for the baby. Moreover, the small recipes given in the book are both classic and innovative. The baby has a good appetite for seeing different patterns every day. What makes this book even better is that it lists a lot of parent-child games and some practical early education knowledge according to the babies of different months, which are very close to life. While enhancing the baby's physique, I also learned how to interact with the baby. 
1	Bo Yang’s painstaking work is just the quality of the book, and I hope it can be improved. 
1	I read the electronic version, and the physical book is available, so I will rate it. 
1	Thinkpad is different. This one is very cost-effective. There is only one C drive and you have to partition it yourself. trouble. The results are all good. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
0	The special room is quite noisy. Near the high-priced bridge, noisy at night. But the room on the back is not bad, and the price is very attractive. The room is very old! The attitude of the waiter was average and he was very busy. The check-in and check-out had been waited for a long time, it took about 10-30 minutes to complete. 
0	When typing, the left half of the keyboard is obviously sinking; there is light leakage on both sides of the screen; the waiting time for the goods is a bit long, and I can pick it up on the sixth day. 
0	There is great hype and advertising suspicion! It can be said clearly in one sentence, the author should use one chapter to elaborate. The whole book has one meaning: fairness should be considered when doing things. Recommend not to buy! 
0	E5400 is of good quality. Friends who don’t install the system must pay attention to it. Linux is not easy to use. Try to buy one with windows. 
1	The breakfast is very rich and the service is friendly. When you check out very early in the morning, the front desk staff is also very fast. 
1	"Every story in the book is very moving. Whether it can be tender or not varies from person to person. Most of the stories in it exist. I believe it helps me a lot by understanding the experiences of others. Love is also an art. Reading this book makes me better understand what love is. I like ""Yi Lin"" very much, and I remember that I bought it for the first time because it was recommended by the third-year Chinese teacher. After that, I fell in love with it. It has been 3 years since I bought it almost every issue. Dangdang. I called Yilin Magazine and said I wanted to buy this book, and then they recommended it. Haha I sincerely hope that ""Yi Lin"" will get better and better!!! "
1	"I bought both this book and ""The success of a good boy comes from a 1% change in my mother"". I very much agree with some of the author's views. Among them, the deep feelings are: 1. For children, academic performance is not the most important, the key It is the cultivation of basic abilities. Parents must be farsighted. 2. The best way to educate children is to learn in life. 3. Regarding the cultivation of children's independence, some of these small examples are worth learning from parents. 4. For children, there must not only be sufficient freedom, but also some necessary regulations, and once the rules are set, there must be no exceptions. I deeply feel this. "
1	"Upgraded me to a ""Korean-style room"". I walked in and took off my shoes on the kang. There were only two big mattresses on the kang, which felt a little crude. The toilet toilet has a flushing device, which is good! "
0	After reading this book, the only gain is that the author tells you to cherish your body, but I already know this 
0	The book is good, but in the set I received, there are two in the sixth, and the fifth is missing. Let Dangdang exchange the goods for a long time. Later, I said that I would give us a 15 yuan gift certificate as compensation. It has been a few days and I haven't seen Dangdang's reply, nor have I received the gift certificate. Also, I ordered a New Year gift for my friend’s child on January 15th. It’s the 23rd today and it has not been sent out yet. I complained, but there was no reply. Dangdang really rubbish. If you think you are reasonable, don't delete it! ! ! 
0	"I have stayed at this hotel four times in a month, and I know these people at the front desk, but every time I check in, both men and women at the front desk keep their heads down and cold, and they don’t even say hello. I don’t know what they are doing. This is the only 4-star hotel I have ever seen. After the checkout, I only said that it was OK, and never said that it was welcome next time. I used to observe for 10 minutes. During this period, the last words of several people who checked out were ""It's okay"", and most of them didn't look at the customers, just sorted their things. In addition, the room is too dim and depressing. "
0	Slightly heavier; the piano lacquer top cover is too easy to get fingerprints; the power adapter will be hot after using for a period of time... 
0	It's a pity that we can't provide the driver disk of winXP. You have to find one by one after reinstalling the system! A little troublesome! 
0	This is a book that picks up other people's leaks. I regret buying such a worthless book. Please don't be fooled anymore! ! ! ! 
1	The feeling of staying is as follows: the feeling of not being able to find a 5-star hotel, and the overall level can only be considered as 4-star at most. Although the house price is about 100 yuan cheaper than Zhongzhou Crown, all hardware and software are far less than Zhongzhou Crown. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, I live in a superior business room. I feel that the room is very small. The doorman and waiter are very enthusiastic. There are free fruits. The carpet and decoration are a bit old~ 
1	Because the screen is 16:9, the fonts are very small when playing games or browsing the web, which makes it difficult to see 
0	Yesterday I wrote a review with excitement, and today I encountered an uproar. Because I recommended this set of books to many friends, my friends dragged me to buy them online, but I bought three sets the day before yesterday. The delivery was quite fast, but I only gave it. Three copies of 1, no 2, why is it that the goods on an order are not all returned? I have sent a return application, but I don’t know if it can be returned, but I actually don’t want to return it. I just want to buy the whole. You can call and ask twice, once. If it is in stock, let me place an order again. I said that it was out of stock. Don’t place an order. What can I do? I have been in the business for many times and have not encountered this situation. The person who responded said that it was because the web page was updated slowly. , How can it be so slow? 
1	The doorman seems to be good, I don’t remember the others. I slept well at night 
1	"I am a listener of ""Let's Listen Tonight"" by the Voice of China. After hearing the show made by Teacher Yin, I immediately wanted to buy this book. But after asking all of our bookstores, there are none. As a result, I had no choice but to try Dangdang online, because the first time I bought a book online, I didn't have much hope. Today's book is here, and I feel very good. Of course, it refers to Dangdang's service, price, and quality. At the same time, I selected a few articles and read the three words ""awesome"". In the future, I will buy books in Dangdang. "
0	The installation of the operating system is too troublesome, and I still can’t install it now. Who knows, please give me pointers, QQ:183915145 
1	I often think that smart is better than wisdom. I feel that after watching Lala, I think smart women are more pitiful. It is undeniable that this is a good book. A very good book a year ago My friend sent me an electronic copy and didn't read it. This time after I bought it at Dangdang, it took two days to read it. It is very attractive, and it is a good guide for those who yearn for foreign companies. For those smart women, it is a perfect guide to life, a book suitable for collection and perusal! 
1	The rooms are very good and the facilities are very new. Overall, it is very satisfactory. The surrounding is very convenient, there is a shopping mall next door downstairs. 
0	The rooms are average, really average. No breakfast. It's still an office building with many people. Hotel feedback April 25, 2008: The room depends on your personal preference. You may not like our room type. Regarding the office building, the proportion of office rooms in our building is very small, less than 10%. I hope you can understand and stand by! 
1	It should be regarded as the best hotel in Yangshuo. It's on the west street and close to the bus station. And to cross a bridge to get to the hotel, it’s also a highlight. But Yangshuo is a small place after all, and the hotel room facilities should not reach the four-star standard. 
1	At the same time, I compiled the textbooks in comparison, and there was another test question bank to use and strengthen. Because the test questions in this book are biased and explained and summarized. I like this series of summary questions the most. It is not only suggestive but also has key knowledge points. It saves a lot of time for self-planning. 
1	It didn't take too much effort to finish reading both books. Although I was only a junior, I saw myself in Lala. When I closed the books, I felt that when people grew up, the more they spoke, the more tired they were. When you hear every sentence, you have to think about the meaning behind it, and every sentence you say must be the conclusion of careful and careful consideration. Exemption has become a top priority. Even though he is already the HR manager of DB, Lala has to face the bleak reality. Neither the first nor the second part explained too much about the final ending of Wang Wei, no matter what, I still hope it will be a happy ending. 
1	Authentic, the packaging has not been opened. PS: Last time I bought a mobile phone, the packaging was opened. Fast running speed and good heat dissipation! Also gave away bags and memory sticks! Install the included memory stick to run much faster! 
1	1. The display has no dead pixels or bright spots. The two notebooks I bought on Jingdong are all perfect screens. 2. The keyboard is very easy to use, the keys are very comfortable, but the space bar has a strange sound 3. Heat dissipation: The heat dissipation of the machine is very good Yes, it doesn’t feel hot on the keyboard, but it’s hotter under the hard drive. 4. CD-ROM drive: It has a strong ability to read disks, and it’s okay to put D version discs. Not bad. 6. There is a camera, the camera is quite clear 
1	The location is good. It takes about 7.5 yuan from the bus terminal to the hotel by TAXI. The rooms are even better, clean, tidy and comfortable, at a price of 355 per night, which is very cost-effective. But breakfast is a bit expensive! I will stay in Quanzhou next time. 
1	I read this book out of curiosity. It's also because I also advertise. I hope I can learn something from it. After reading it. To be honest, I didn't feel much at first. Just like I read any other romance novels, fantasy novels and the like. Thinking about it. This writing is so lucky. For the luck of the hostess. Not all people can mess around with their friends in a city, let alone a childhood friend who can stay with you for a long time. Occasionally, they will cry bitterly when they have text messages on the phone. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, guests have to check in every time. I just don’t know why every time the front desk makes a mess with you for the smoking and non-smoking areas, even if you have emphasized and confirmed when you book, the front desk will try to change you to a smoking area for smoke-free treatment. Was defeated! 
1	I like things very much, feel good, delivery is fast, it takes less than 20 hours to place the order~~ The heat dissipation is also good~~ 
0	"The hotel room is very small and triangular-the bathroom facilities are outdated and low-grade. The service attitude is poor: the waiter knocks on the door like a loan shark. When I asked for a thick quilt from the hotel, the one I brought was not covered and covered with hair. People disgusted! Then I remembered asking for a hotel bag for stuff-there was none! ! ! Later I took a used plastic bag! The room is next to the street and very cold! After explaining to the waiter-he even slowly said: ""Isn't this cheap~"" It was so natural! 110 a room is cheaper! The room rate can be discounted but the service must not be discounted! －－I will definitely not stay at this hotel next time I go to Zhengzhou－－The above remarks only represent personal opinions and are not directed against third parties. I am quite satisfied with the service of Ctrip. "
1	It is beautiful, looks good, and the price/performance ratio feels pretty good. It has simple functions and is suitable for traveling on business. The blue camera is available to meet basic needs. For those who are not demanding, it is worth buying. It can meet general Internet needs. 
1	The hotel is close to the foot of the mountain, the air is fresh, and the downtown area is quiet. I really want to go for a morning jog when I get up early in the morning and look out the window. Near Hong Kong’s SOHO district, there is the longest elevator commuting to Central nearby. Especially at night, you can take a stroll down to Languifang, where there are various exotic restaurants and bars along the way. Friends who like petty bourgeoisie like it very much. The disadvantage is the inconvenience of transportation. One of the times when I returned to the hotel, it made me walk for nearly half an hour before I went back to my accommodation. The most convenient means of transportation in and out of the hotel is rental. The reception service of the hotel is no problem. 
1	The location is very good, very close to Yantai Mountain, East Fort, Changyu Wine Museum, the seaside pedestrian street is very beautiful, and the music fountain is also good. Disadvantages: The fan coil of the central air conditioner in the commercial standard room (6601) is not well insulated, resulting in condensation and mold; in addition, the slippers provided free of charge are extremely slippery after being soaked in water! 
1	The mainstream configuration and CPU frequency are slightly higher than others; Bluetooth, WIFI, camera, card reader are available; the appearance is also very beautiful; the price is cheaper than HP and Lenovo. 
0	I saw a lot of comments before, saying that I was very excited to buy it. I was very disappointed when I saw it. The hype is big, and the practical little author boasted that his story accounted for less than half of the book. Just look at his blog 
1	I booked a room of 260, which was not bad. I stayed for two nights. It was the reception hotel of the previous government. It was a bit old, but it was okay. It was similar in all aspects, not bad, but not very good. I think the bed is quite comfortable. Around the hotel is quite prosperous, it should be a commercial area. 
0	The language is empty, the plot is too outrageous, and I don’t feel shocked. I just feel that this person is too unlucky, and there is nothing to explore. I think the wonderful part of the whole book may be the preface. 
0	1. There is no genuine system, so when the XP is modified, the hp after-sales service does not help to reinstall the system. It costs 100 yuan to find the merchant in the computer city to install it, and the merchant says this is a special machine. The technical department of the merchant took 3 hours to install it. All the drivers are installed~~ 2. The power consumption is fast, about 2-3 hours without power 
1	I like Fu Peirong's book very much. The narrative style is very casual. At the very least, you will not lose interest in some esoteric theories. It also avoids the pretending to be esoteric books for academic research and evaluation of professional titles. But there is one thing I don't like. Fu Peirong said that philosophy focuses on speculation, reflection, and analysis. But when it comes to the mainland, it loses its philosophical vision. Either say something in general terms about 10 billion people, or say that there are too many people on the surface. Haha, it's still—every rivers go back to the sea. There are many good things in the great continent, and don't think Xizhe is too mysterious. But I like this book. 
0	It took a long time to think of the evaluation, remember that it is super close to the train station, but it will definitely feel noisy while being convenient. Many Korean and Japanese tour groups live here, and the front desk service is cold. Two people live in a standard room, only give a room card, and look at me provocatively. Angry and not in the mood. Hotel feedback July 17, 2008: The hotel has seriously rectified the problems raised by guests. I hope that everyone who stays at Bohai Pearl Hotel will be happy to stay and return with satisfaction. 
0	This time I stayed in a deluxe room, the one on the 19th floor is the best (?). But after entering, I found that the room was only 8-10o square meters, and the original room was divided into two. The windows are shared by the two, only half the size, and there is no sound insulation in this way. The rooms are very crowded and simple. It takes 15 minutes for the water to heat up. The temperature of the air conditioner cannot be controlled by yourself. Very unreasonable price of 220 yuan! I asked whether the waiters were all such rooms, and the answer was that they were all, and the hotel rooms of Heirloom Business Travel are all like this! I don’t like to have a suite where I can live, it’s big! I wanted to switch to a debit card to settle the bill. I replied that there was no way to cancel the original authorization and could only be completed by deduction. But the deducted money cannot be returned to me! Said that they have no way to do the accounting! Heirlooms look like a black shop! That's all, that's all! I originally wanted to use the family heirloom as my permanent hotel, thank you! Just fell in love for one night and bought one. It's still worth it. I am very happy to delete Heirloom from my list of permanent hotels:) At the same time, I also suggested that Ctrip also delete this store from the hotel. Additional comments January 24, 2007: One additional point: The bed on the 19th floor is very short, and it feels like sleeping on the ground. The bed is also very old. It felt like falling into a pit when I fell asleep. 
0	Some disappointment, not as good as expected. It is more suitable for kindergarten children to read. But not very good for elementary school students. 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
1	When I was in my second year of college, there was a text in English reading that was an excerpt from the original English version of this book. After reading it at that time, I very much agreed with the author's point of view, and since that time I made a secret decision: When I have a child, I must insist on reading to TA! Now I am going to be a mother soon, so I bought this book, hoping to learn about reading aloud before the baby is born, and prepare for the future. ^_^ Hope that more parents can also join the team of reading to children, let's read to the baby together! 
1	Portable, mainstream configuration, good workmanship, a very high-grade notebook, I have always liked it, finally got it, I like it. . . . . . And the gifts are more value-for-money. The memory and hard disks can be applied to the notebook, otherwise you have to buy it yourself. The VISTA system is not as bad as the legend, and the individual design is good, and the heat dissipation is good. 
0	The hotel did not recognize this reservation, and it was resolved after 7 or 8 negotiations with Ctrip! ! Additional comments June 20, 2007: Clearly stayed at the hotel! More than 300 windowless rooms, barely a 3-star standard, not as fast as living 
1	High cost performance, good appearance! We still have to look at the price. After all, the 3400 machine with the same configuration has long exceeded the purchase budget. The ancestors said that you get what you pay for! As long as there are no major problems with things, they are worthy of this price! Its appearance design is still very different. The inlaid logo design in the center of the fuselage is a bit petty bourgeoisie. With the moist piano paint on the fuselage, the overall appearance is exquisite and exquisite. 
1	"""Babe Bear Series"" is my son's favorite set of books. When he was not in elementary school, he always asked me to repeat the previous episodes to him every night before going to bed. After I was in elementary school, I bought all the remaining stories. Every week, the school asked to write reading notes. He read it by himself, learning to understand the meaning of the story, and then copied down good words and sentences and wrote down simple experiences. The reading notes every week are praised by the teacher, and he also understands a lot of the truth in life from it, and he often learns and uses it, and moves to reason with me. "
0	I have paid for more than 2 weeks and I have not received the book. What should I do? I accidentally ordered the delivery confirmation. No one paid any attention to complaints. . . Ooh~ 
0	1. The machine is heavier. 2. VISTA is not used to it, and it takes up a lot of the system. 3. The audio jack and the two USB ports on the right front side feel too close when using the mouse. 
1	The hotel service is good. I originally booked a standard room, but when I arrived, I asked to change to a double room. The hotel readily helped me change it. Other services are also in place, daily newspapers, fruits, coffee, and tea are provided free of charge. The location is also very close to the city center. Is it the price? Since I haven't asked for the price anywhere else, I won't comment. Overall, this time is very satisfactory. 
0	1. The reflection of the screen is too bad, and the people who came up with the mirror screen are too wicked. No way, I looked around and found that only the ThinkPad t system has a universal screen, which is too expensive. 
1	"She Ziqiang, the ""King of Guangzhou Tang"", didn’t know before he came to the south from the north, hehe, he didn’t know until I bought the book. I am indeed a celebrity. It seems that my choice is right. The book is indeed valuable. There is still some discomfort in the body. As time goes by, his effect is slowly shown to me. It can withstand the test. He integrates Chinese herbal medicine with daily diet and is closely related to our daily life, allowing us to ""live healthy"" , I also like Guangzhou’s ""beautiful soup"" culture more and more, ha ha "
0	The material is average, the mold is average, not exquisite, not rough, just so-so. sis chip, and 1g memory are a bit brooding. If the sound card and modem are installed with the XP generation, they must first patch the kb888111, otherwise they will not be able to drive. 
1	I don’t know if the author of ‘Secret’ has ever interviewed the author of this book. From the time point of view, the author of this book should have understood the secret of the universe earlier: ‘everything is one thing. When you want something, the entire universe will work together to help you realize your wish. 'First reading will think it is a certain mythical treasure hunt like'One Thousand and One Nights'. In fact, the stories in the book have profound meanings and are very intriguing. For readers who want to understand the meaning of life and pursue a free and happy life, this book does not Will let you down. After reading this book, I have an urge to do something I have thought of and haven't done for two years. 
1	The education method introduced is very operational, as magical as a magic. It turned out that my baby (4 and a half years old) was very naughty when he played the piano. I was very angry, and she felt wronged, and then she refused to play the piano. Using the method taught in this book, we are both very happy now, and she has made great progress. When the family saw the note written by the two of us, they almost couldn't walk with a smile: There were three ways for her: throw away the piano, not play the piano, and play the piano randomly. Of course, under my guidance, she crossed it out by herself, leaving only my suggestion: play once a day, play well! 
1	Ordinary record Federer is extraordinary. He has had brilliance, faults, laughter and tears. I believe that his journey is still wonderful, victory and defeat, and also wonderful. His perfection lies in the pursuit of perfection... , I like it now, and I will always like it in the future. Such a person creates perfection, how much he wins, how much he loses, how much he gives, and how much he gains. ROGER will continue to complete his life and make him more beautiful. We will still support and watch silently. , To see how he plays a perfect game and draws a perfect life. 
1	The machine is relatively light, 2G is 2 pieces of one G memory. The sound quality of the speakers is average. Ha ha. It turned out to be a DOS system, and I will install XP directly after returning. The speed is good. The configuration is relatively high. 
0	Why is such a mediocre work so popular? sweat! Workplace novels appeared soon, and they have already been fired to death. In China, everything is a fast word. It appears fast, and die fast! Why is the Chinese people's sheep-like nature so full? One is that our reading ability is completely destroyed by our education, and people with very high academic qualifications also lack the basic reading ability. In addition, under the dictatorship of the central government for more than 2,000 years, China has killed all the people with personalities. We are all descendants of obedient people who lack ideas! ! ! ! ! 
1	Very good hotel, very standardized and easy to live. The restaurant should generally not be, I don’t know why. Hotel feedback April 17, 2008: The restaurant has been renovated and the dining environment is much better than before. Thank you for your valuable comments! 
1	White, very beautiful, good workmanship, easy to change XP, the next asus oem XP with SATA, install directly, no problem, the driver is only wireless, just download it online 
0	I bought this book because I read everyone's reviews, but after I bought it and read dozens of pages, I found it to be too simple. Although the author has her reason, I believe she has not done all the content in it... I don’t feel anything, nor the feeling that attracts me to read...It's probably suitable for junior high school students. People who don't have high requirements for reading quality can just flip it... 
0	"We checked in on 6/23 (Monday), I live on the 5th floor, the room number is forgotten, my evaluation is extremely poor 1. We checked in at 10pm that day, the front desk was not staffed enough, 1 waiter, I was in front of you For the two customers who were going to check in, I waited 15-20 minutes to check in. 2. There was no free water in the room, but later the waiter helped us bring it. 3. The worst thing is the cleanliness of the room. Sheets, sheets, and pillows all leave things that are suspected of ""menstruation"" or ""semen"". The former can clearly see red areas, while the latter is irregular. The block makes us feel very sick. 4. The only ok is that the waiter is asked to change the sheets and sheets. The hands and feet are quick and the attitude is kind. In fact, I have complained to the waiter on the same day and asked the waiter to respond to the hotel. Embarrassed and sorry. 5. The Great Wall is a 4-star hotel, and we hope it can be above 4-star. Hotel feedback August 11, 2008: Dear guests, hello! Thank you for choosing to stay at this hotel. We apologize for the situation you encountered during your stay. The management of the hotel takes it seriously and has requested the relevant departments to be reasonable Allocate the working hours of front desk staff. In terms of room hygiene, we also order relevant departments to strictly control the quality of linen washing and strengthen the sense of responsibility of the staff. Finally, thank you for your valuable comments on the hotel, we must actively improve, and welcome you again with a new look. "
0	The original work is okay, but it is just a set of general books after being translated into Chinese; I don't know why so many people say it is good, I also bought it after these reviews. 
1	My best friend always complains to me in the middle of the night, saying that she misses so-and-so so much that she even wants to sleep and forget. When the man cared for him to give the stars to the stars and the moon to the moon, she disappeared in two days. With a girlfriend, she is going to die. I say that this is guilty, and that is to love more when you can't get it. Just like what Sister Mina said: When you are in love, it is not too troublesome to do too much. When you are not in love, it is too difficult to press a mobile phone number. I decided to lend her this book to let her realize and let her see the sun again in her dark heart. 
1	I bought the second epc. The first one is the first generation 701. If you want to buy a laptop, please do not buy epc. If you are mobile office and frequent business trips, epc is the best choice. The quality of ASUS is other domestic OEM Netbooks are incomparable, with good quality and low price. 
1	High cost performance. After IBM was acquired, it changed from an aristocratic machine to a popular machine. Everyone can enjoy the addiction. 
1	Personally, I like the strong Beijing-style speaking of the protagonists in the book, and I admire the author's classic lines as casual reading materials. I definitely like it! The content of the whole book is still written slowly from beginning to end in a relaxed way, but at the end a small accident is arranged, and the actor leaves without saying goodbye. Of course, the final ending is a happy game, but It always makes me feel a little far-fetched... Maybe I liked the male protagonist from the beginning, so I personally hope that the author can describe this character more richly, but at the same time I like the author's simple tick Actor, contradictory... 
1	Lightweight, powerful battery, large enough keyboard size, easy typing, cpu performance, good WLAN performance, and relatively garbage camera 
0	After I got this book, I was very angry because the spine of the book was completely broken, o(︶︿︶)o greatly affected the mood of reading. I don’t know how a book damaged to this degree can be shipped to customers! ! ! ! ! 
1	The appearance is simple and the performance is strong, it can meet most office and audio-visual entertainment needs, and the system is installed quickly. Note that the installation of the network card is slightly different from the installation of other drivers, so you need to pay attention. 
1	When my son came home, I took out the book and looked for it with him. The little guy is very powerful. I didn’t find any inconspicuous objects. He found it at once (really don’t underestimate the child’s ability). This is even more exciting , Got more excited, clamoring for me to read what he was looking for (four years old next month, illiterate), reluctant to put it down when eating, I am so happy to see my son like it so much! Actually, I also like it very much. When my son falls asleep at night, I still find it by myself for a while, but I think it’s more sweet to play with my son, with heads together, people together, and hearts together. 
0	The hotel is rather biased, although it is on Dongfang Road, there are no restaurants around to eat 
0	"Yu Dan’s ""The Analects of Confucius"" experience (highly recommended by Yi Zhongtian's preface) First of all, I don’t think Yi Zhongtian really wanted to write a preface to Yu Dan’s book. From that article, I can’t feel that he has any admiration for this book, but it’s just not good. I wrote it off, after all, I started with the same show. Secondly, the content of this book is on the surface the experience of writing the Analects, and the content is just using the Analects as an introduction, telling some irrelevant words, and interspersed with short stories that do not fit the theme. A little bit of suspicion of selling dog meat. Yu Dan played well when she was doing the show. This is a must-have skill for her career as a professor. You can quote from others and make the Analects attractive enough, but if you really get this book for scrutiny, it will really not stand up to it. You can take a closer look. Anyway, I have read many stories on the Internet, and I know the theme, but Comrade Yu Dan's experience in the Analects seems to be far from the theme. But one thing is certain. She made the Analects civilians and let more people pay attention to it, which is consistent with the purpose of Baijia Forum. Since it is ""experience"", there is nothing wrong with it. I am not saying that I have to translate the Analects sentence by sentence into an obscure professional essay, so that it is impossible to communicate with the people. Therefore, the Analects is easy to understand, and it is close to the public. The achievement may be here. Professors sometimes fool people, so please accept it critically. "
1	The Dolby-certified speakers are good. The speakers are always considered to be weak. After receiving the goods, I downloaded a high-definition trailer of Transformers. The effect is quite good in terms of books. The effect of the led screen is good, and the brightness seems to be even 
1	Tolerance is a kind of cultivation and maturity. This kind of cultivation does not show weakness, but strength, charm, extraordinary vision and mind; it is a deep understanding of human nature, an overall grasp of interests, and a fullness of individuality. Respect is the implementation and implementation of the principle of coexistence. Tolerance is a holistic concept and a long-term vision. Imagine how a mature person would play a rascal in front of a rascal child? Imagine how a gentleman would care about a villain’s tricks? The content of the book is good, it is worth reading 
0	The disadvantage is that the battery is not strong enough, the memory is a little bit less, and the switch of the wireless network is a bit troublesome. 
1	The material is very good, the weight is not heavy, it is suitable for girls, and it is small. The keyboard is also large, and the 6* battery fluid is very durable 
0	I booked 2 single rooms through Ctrip. When I arrived at the hotel, the front desk told me that I had booked 1 single room and 1 standard room. After strong negotiations, the hotel still gave me 2 single rooms, but the facilities inside were extremely poor. The door has a strong smell of smoke and smell, the TV remote control board is broken, the quilt in the room is super thin, and the air conditioner has to be turned on to the maximum. The cabinet was full of pillows but there was no quilt, the water in the bathroom was not smooth, and the floor was covered with water after a bath... The only thing worth mentioning was that it was good early. The summary is as follows: 1. There is a problem with the room reservation. Ctrip has booked 2 single rooms with me, but when I arrive at the hotel, it becomes 1 single room and 1 standard room; 2. The condition of the hotel is too poor and does not meet the three-star standard at all, so it is not recommended to stay 
1	I booked it for a friend, and everyone reported that it was good and the accommodation conditions were good. The room price is not expensive, the breakfast variety is still rich, the lunch buffet is quite cheap, I suggest you have the opportunity to try it. I will still live next time. 
0	The six-core battery is installed in the back to protrude a large area that affects the appearance. The slow speed machine is a bit stuck. It is heavier than ordinary netbooks when singing. The touchpad and mouse are not sensitive and the sliding area is too small. 
0	The rooms are not clean and the facilities are outdated. Will not live in the future, it is better to Green Tree Inn or Home Inns. 
0	The book is too small and I was disappointed when I took it in my hand. I thought it would be so exquisite~~~ It's really suitable for children to read, but it's not easy for very young children Not worth it 
0	All viewpoints are discussed in general terms, and have no practical effect. Very disappointed. What a great effect for any educated woman 
0	Generally speaking, the hotel is really not good. First of all, the air conditioner is broken. Secondly, the windows are leaking. It is very cold at night. When sleeping, I can only put my head in the bedding. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If you have the opportunity to go to Dandong, you will never stay here 
1	I have seen Mr. Jinbo’s name in major bookstores, but have never read his story. I bought this book this time mainly because I think it is necessary to cultivate my children’s rich language skills. After I bought it and read it, I found that adults are also good at reading, can recall their childhood dreams, and need to relax and calm down when reading poems, which can calm down their anxious hearts, which is very good. Decided to get up every morning to read a song, so that I can calm down all day and not be upset about all kinds of trivial matters. 
0	A very small hotel. In the community, it takes about 2-3 minutes to walk to the road. The shower water in the hotel is relatively small. What is particularly unsatisfactory is that the check-out cannot be delayed until 2 o'clock. It can only be 12:30, otherwise it will be added. Friends who charge half-day room fees, eat out or take a short break at noon should pay attention. The current hotel does not have late check-out, and I have not encountered it yet. This is the first one I have encountered. 
0	I thought it was a funny comic, but I bought three copies after seeing the popularity on the Internet! Unexpectedly, it's just like the author's life diary, writing some things in life, and the language is also very common (maybe it is due to translation). In short, I think it is a bit boring, hehe~It should be suitable for young girls~hehe ~ (PS: I am 18, male) 
1	Sheraton Tianfu Lido Hotel is nice. The price is relatively affordable. The hardware is definitely enough for a five-star standard. The environment is also very good. The service is in place. Checked in once in March 2007. The people who store luggage are friendly. The location is close to People's Square, which is definitely a prime location. The road at the door is a one-way street, this should be paid attention to 
1	1. Long standby time, about 8 hours; 2. Light weight, about 1.5kg, convenient to take on business trips; 3. This configuration is enough for basic office work, listening to music, and watching movies; 4. Basic equipment for Internet access Yes, camera, microphone, speaker, wired, wireless Internet, Bluetooth, enough. 
0	After listening to the introduction, I want to use this book to make up for some bad translation habits in English. Obviously, after reading this book, the content of this book is too shallow for people who have finished high school English. The pictures in the examples in it seem to be screenshots from the Internet. . In addition, I bought a lot of books because the quality of this book was defective, and the spine of the book was crushed. It was so troublesome to apply for a book exchange. The ridiculous thing was that the application for rejection was so simple that it was crazy. Quietly waiting for the book back... 
1	After reading it in one breath, I feel that the life of sales is so ups and downs. An order can let you rise to a very high position, and it can also make you fall to the bottom all of a sudden, and your previous efforts have been in vain. In addition to sales skills and contacts, this also contains a lot of luck. Take advantage of the opportunity. It is not only suitable for sales people to read, but also benefits people in other jobs, especially for students who have just entered the workplace, they may have a perceptual understanding of the workplace. 
1	I think this novel gets better and better. The back feels more comfortable than the front, and the front has too much flavor, so I can write my own feelings later. Li Zeliang should be very contradictory in front of Freehand. His legs actually gave him a lot of inferiority, at least for Shen Freehand, that's why there are so many contradictory behaviors. When Li Zeliang wanted to get up from the bed, he looked sideways at the prosthesis that was forced to be removed, his complexion became cold, and the people became bored. The people watching here were really sad. It takes more than ordinary courage for Li Zeliang to show his leg calmly in front of freehand brushwork! 
0	The camera position is reserved, but no, the keyboard gap is large, the delivery address is not available, and there is no phone. You have to call to change the address by yourself. The service awareness needs to be improved, but the delivery speed is very fast after the address is changed 
1	Good things, beautiful paint finish, stable machine operation and fast speed. Good things, beautiful paint finish, stable machine operation and fast speed.

0	This hotel has price discrimination against Ctrip guests, so it is not recommended for everyone to stay. We checked in on August 8 (of course we booked through Ctrip before we checked in, the price was 996 yuan/day). On the day of check-in, the front desk said it was 498 yuan/day, and a 2,000 yuan credit card pre-authorization was obtained. At 7 pm on the 10th, when we checked out, the receptionist said that we would check out at a price of 996 yuan/day (no one had notified us during this period). The reason was that this price was given by Ctrip, which happened before our checkout. The price given by the guest at the front desk is 498 yuan/day, because of the 8:02 train, we have no choice but to check out at 996 yuan/day. We despise the front desk with chaotic logic. Do you have to rely on Ctrip to set your prices? 
0	Old hotel, the facilities are very old and simple, I only stayed for one night so it will be done; the traffic is quite convenient, the room overall feels a bit dirty, it should be because of the old reason. Next time I will change to another one, I don’t want to live , There is nothing to miss. There is no network cable. 
1	In fact, I am very grateful to Teacher Ren who has never met before. This book is really worth recommending to students who want to enter the postgraduate entrance examination! I am also a teacher in the university, this book is really great! Hope that more people can realize their dreams through their own efforts! 
0	I have never encountered a front desk with such a bad attitude. We booked 4 rooms on Friday night, but due to temporary need to add 1 room, we asked a male waiter at the front desk, and he answered that we have 1 room, but the price must be separated The guest price is 460, we said we can book according to Ctrip? Even if we are a team, but the front desk told us that Ctrip can no longer book, we asked why, the front desk clerk actually ignored us, and did not raise his eyes to look at us. No, it is according to the regulations. Moreover, we have operated the 4 previously booked rooms on our own. No matter how many times we have asked, we still don’t raise our eyes to look at us. In the end, after irritating a few of us, we actually answered that there was no room. We stepped back and asked if it was okay to add an extra bed. We actually said no (I haven't encountered a hotel that cannot add an extra bed). Everyone is squeezed. How can such a qualified person be able to work at the front desk. Naturally, the mood behind it is self-evident. And the price is not cheap. It is an ordinary economic hotel with no special features, and the price is higher than that of Shanghai. It’s not a late reservation. There are no rooms in other hotels, so I won’t choose this one at all. Additional comments October 21, 2007: In addition, the supporting facilities of this hotel are extremely poor, the chess and card room is actually 3 tables placed in a small In a room. And there is only one automatic mahjong table, other facilities are zero, and nothing. As for the service attitude, the hotel explained that the front desk is new, but the guest house in the traditional sense is much better than him! 
1	Delivery is fast, and it will be delivered the next afternoon after placing the order. It should have not been dismantled, and I looked at it specially, and there is not even a fingerprint. Vista is also okay. It doesn't feel much slower than when the desktop is turned on; I like the bags I sent, and there are so many small bags that are very interesting. 
1	Let’s talk about the quality of storytelling first. There is nothing to criticize. It’s good. The layout of the text inside is also very comfortable to read. Now talk about the contents, I feel that Zhang Xiaoxian has strong insight and many emotional problems. The questions can be said simple and thorough, and every time I read the text inside, I feel a sense of sudden realization! Not bad~~~ I think some of the psychological elements in it are quite large~ It is to analyze the psychological needs of both parties or something, and in this way convince the readers. 
0	The location of the hotel is relatively remote, but Shilaoren Beach is across two roads. The front desk of the hotel is relatively negligent to the guests, especially the waitresses, who have almost no expression on their faces. They don't pay much attention to the inquiries or requests of the guests, or that is, you will wait. It feels bad. The barmen are more enthusiastic, I will mention this later. The hotel room facilities feel average, I ordered a deluxe room, which basically meets the four-star requirements. The big bed is more comfortable. Many items in the room are only available for a fee. Many of the introduction books are marked in Korean. I feel that when I came to Korea, the Chinese characters are not obvious. The hotel’s address is remote, and there are no good restaurants nearby. The restaurants in the hotel are also being renovated. Only coffee shops and Korean restaurants are open. It’s difficult to eat Chinese food. Ask the front desk staff. The whole thing is hot and cold. We were full of anger without eating. In the evening, my friend took us to eat seafood, but at two o'clock in the middle of the night, both of them had vomiting and diarrhea. The waiter asked the waiter to bring some antidiarrheal medicine and hot water. It was still very uncomfortable at five o'clock in the morning, because I had to catch the return flight in the afternoon, so I planned to go to the hospital to see the disease and stop the diarrhea as soon as possible. I wanted to ask the front desk to send someone to accompany us. As a result, the front desk manager (male) had a good attitude. , As a result, when we waited until 6:30, he informed us that the shift was handed over at 6:30. The people on the night shift had to go back to rest, and the people on the morning shift sent us. To be honest, we were all very tired at that time. It doesn't hurt so much, don't bother others, we just go upstairs to rest. At 10 o’clock, I pulled all night, the hungry chest is on the back, the restaurant only has buffet, we have no appetite for any greasy things, so we dragged our weak bodies and asked where there is porridge, but we were on the second floor. I ran to the first floor and the first floor to the second floor. After asking countless times, I finally learned that there was porridge in the cafe three or four times. We asked for two porridge, and told us that a small bowl of 10 yuan, no side dishes, sliced ​​bread, 2 Yuan/piece, plus 15% service charge. In this way, two bowls of porridge and six slices of bread total 37 RMB. My mother and I eagerly miss the 10 RMB self-service breakfast at Taipingjiao Home Inn that we stayed two days ago. After ordering, we went back to the room and rested because of the delivery service. As a result, no waiter came to deliver it. My poor mother pulled and vomited, her face was sallow and she was so hungry because we stopped eating. You have to eat a breakfast pad before the laxative. Later, my mother couldn't help it, and urged me to call the restaurant. I rummaged through the room and explained that because I didn't find the restaurant phone, my mother had to go downstairs to remind myself, but was told that the porridge was still boiling. . . . . . After a long wait, we finally brought the steaming porridge and bread. We were so excited that we finally had something to eat. Later, we talked about the situation with the waiter. He said that our physical condition should go to the hospital. He wanted to talk to the hotel leader. We were very touched. To be honest, the waiter became the most enthusiastic after arriving at the hotel. We checked out and there was no phone call. . . . . The room rate is 618 yuan, but the service is not up to this price. We felt that we enjoyed the star-rated service for the room rate of 209 yuan we stayed at Home Inn. I think the hotel’s facilities can attract many guests, but from Inner smile and sincere service are what our customers care most about. 
0	This is the first time I booked this hotel. The location of the hotel is okay, but it must have been in business for some years. The decoration is a bit old. I checked in and entered the room. I felt that the condition of the room was not good, so I decided to lose half a day’s rent. Find other hotels 
1	The outstanding features are energy saving and long battery life. Small and refined, it can be like this, really a very good netbook. 
0	"Once the water was cut off, it was said to be an emergency. The attitude is quite bad. Two bananas and two apples in the ""fruit basket"" were delivered the next day as an apology. It is recommended not to choose a room near the elevator, there is a service phone at the door, the room is very poorly insulated and very noisy. The two places for breakfast can only score 60 points. The taxi is called now. The service telephone in the corridor on the 14th floor is dirty. "
1	The rooms are average, the soundproofing is not very good, the location is good, just by the river, you can see the Big Buddha from the room near the river. The service attitude of the restaurant is much better than the front desk, and the breakfast variety is less. 
1	Quiet environment, close to the railway station. The rooms are well furnished, and the breakfast is mainly Chinese and rich. Stay next time 
1	Low price and good quality. I bought this configuration at 2999. Many friends who bought a netbook said it was worth it. I installed XP+sp3+IE7+WM11 and downloaded and installed the driver on the official website. The process went smoothly. It runs XP very smoothly, and maintains good performance even after installing common software such as office2003, Acrobat Reader, WinRAR. 
0	It is strongly not recommended for the rooms on the road, especially the single rooms, because the whole room is a bit quiet except for the slightly quieter from 1 am to 5 am. Other times are in the harsh noise. Although the 5 stars are listed, there are 2 star rooms and the worst The service. Will not stay in the future. 
0	The book was poorly bound, and it broke into several copies within a day of reading it. A closer look shows that the book has a long strip of glue on the facade, and all the pages of the book are glued together by this layer of glue, which can easily split. 
0	The environment of the room is very bad, and the room is not soundproof, it is not comfortable. 
0	The power adapter is too hot. Duck can be roasted at the air outlet. The driver is too hard to find. The temperature of the CPU is not lower than 65, and it is generally maintained at around 75. I haven't played games yet. 
0	I lived on the fifth day of the year, and there was no heating or hot water on such a cold day. The front desk of Ctrip's reservation said it did not receive it. In short, I feel very amateurish. 
1	1. The appearance is good, the color I like; 2. The heat dissipation effect is good, after a day of driving, the battery here is a little bit higher, and the heat dissipation is a little bit worse than that of the Lenovo used by my colleagues 3. The keyboard keys are very soft, like one 
0	I really don’t know how this book is popular in Korea. It’s so boring and empty. I can’t read it after reading a few pages. It’s obvious that his writing is very large and thick. 
0	Very ordinary inspirational books, the kind that are everywhere on the street. Deceived by the beautiful packaging. It took an hour or so to read it, and there was not much content. I regret it now. 
1	It's really good. I bought it for my 2-and-a-half-year-old son. At first, I was a little worried. I thought each book has nearly 30 pages. Will it be too long? I was worried that he would not be able to sit still. As a result, after reading one book after another, and reading 5 or 6 books in one night, the first thing I could not stand was me. The book is very interesting, I am often chuckled, sometimes nervous. Recommend it to a colleague. She gave it to her 6-year-old daughter. She can read by herself and likes it very much. No wonder it was the sales champion for several weeks. 
1	The biggest advantage of this book is that all the nursery rhymes are very smooth, not very long. Generally, you can memorize it once or twice. After all, it is unrealistic to read nursery rhymes to your baby while holding the book while reading it; These nursery rhymes have a certain educational significance, and listening to them a lot is still good for the baby's behavior and habits. The disadvantage of this book is that the quality of the paper is not very good. My baby (half-year-old) grabbed it and torn it, alas. 
0	Personally, I think this book is average, and I haven't got any useful inspiration from it! Is it a problem of translation, or is it a problem of my understanding? Sometimes I don’t know what kind of advice the author wants to give my parents. 
1	I just received the unused one today, it should be good. Let’s not waste the evaluation and wait for a period of time before publishing the usage and experience to provide your reference. 
1	A very high-end machine, it used to be very expensive in stores. After 415 came out, the price of this machine was reduced. Everyone reported that the performance of this model is good, magnesium aluminum alloy, roll cage. . . For the price of 4999, it is indeed invincible 
1	There are three books in total. My daughter just read two books, Biology and Civilization. My daughter especially liked the dinosaurs and prehistoric humans in the Biology Edition. She just got the Biology Book and talked for an hour on the first night. Now she is reading the Book of Civilizations and has a lot of interest in the Black Death in the Hundred Years' War between Britain and France. As far as the whole book of civilization is concerned, it mainly involves the development history of the world, while the content of China is relatively small. At present, I only see some knowledge about Confucius, Terracotta Warriors and Horses, and ancient China, which is a bit uninteresting. But the picture is not very beautiful. When the child of a friend of mine saw the science and technology album, he intuitively thought the painting was too ugly. 
1	The environment is good. The transportation is also convenient. The service is good. Will consider next time 
1	This is the second book in this series, and I can’t wait to read it after reading the first book. It also took me one night to finish reading the whole book in one go. China has a vast territory and rich resources, and its long history makes it possible for various adventures in the book to exist, so the book's readability is enhanced. I even thought that if I was still young, maybe I would follow them and travel around the world. Although the starting point of the tomb thief is not good, the thieves also have a way. Those who pay attention to martial rules can help those buried historical sites to see the light again. 
1	Live here every time! Especially the restaurant, let people linger :) 
0	The heat dissipation is not very good! The graphics card driver is too difficult to find, and it doesn't match the model number. I got a graphics card driver from the English website mentioned above. I have a little card playing with the Red Alert. I don't know why! Warcraft is okay! Can anyone tell me why? 
0	It is inconvenient to install the XP system and does not provide drivers. The network card driver installation is not very smooth, the network card cannot be found when the power is used, and the hardware is found only when the battery is used. It feels weird. . . . 
1	The service is ok, the room is good, 888888888888888888888888 
0	It’s obviously out of stock but it doesn’t show up, and it’s not notified when it’s out of stock. I knew that there was no such item when I received it! Dangdang likes to lie! 
1	The appearance is stylish and the use is very good. After three days of all-day power-on testing and four days of normal use, no problems occurred. The first step has been passed, and it is estimated that there will be no problems. Ha ha 
1	A very intriguing book. What Mr. Bo Yang said should be very objective. Some people disagree, or strongly criticize it, perhaps because the language is a bit too radical and sharp, but we are always complaining, or perhaps It’s so complacent that we don’t know why, but with this effort, we never know introspection. As the object of blame, we should think about it: Are we doing well? Is there nothing for others to blame? ! In other words, Teacher Bo Yang was a little bit angry because of the 10 years of unjust imprisonment, but he was awakening something deep in our hearts at the same time! 
0	Before I bought it, I saw that someone in the evaluation said that there was a problem with the keyboard I just got. I always thought it was an isolated phenomenon, so I bought it. Unfortunately, I got a notebook with a problematic keyboard. I contacted Dell after-sales service to change the keyboard. Jingdong simply ignored it, shopping was unpleasant! It was produced in October 2008. 
0	The overall feeling is very bad. The hotel is actually in the form of a short-term apartment. It is hidden on the first floor of an apartment. It is not very easy to find. The smell of the room is very heavy and it feels dirty. It is estimated that the sanitation staff are not diligent in cleaning. It can be seen that the hotel wants to imitate the feeling of a love hotel and the simplicity of a business hotel. But the two are not the same. The details are too poor 
1	Because the Yuehua Hotel has no rooms, I passed Ctrip Dingquanzhou Hotel. In fact, the whole of Quanjiu is more elegant than Yuehua, and the decoration is also very particular. The only thing that is less than Yuehua is the service and breakfast. 
0	It may be that I have encountered a very few cases. The new machine has a white screen when it is turned on. There is no display, and there is no ASUS logo. It has been sent back on the day of delivery and requested to be returned. The incident is being processed. 
0	I stayed here for the first time. I had a colleague stayed there before, so I thought it should be okay. I didn’t expect: 1. The doorman was very uninitiated. Several doormen stood at the door chatting with the security guard, ignoring the guests and asking me to stand by myself. I stopped the car on the road. The damn thing is that after I stopped the car, the doorman actually ran from the door and said that he was helping the customer in front of the car. Seeing him lead the car to an old house, I was almost mad; 2 , The swimming pool is average, but the jacuzzi next to it looks very dirty, it can't be used, the dressing room is dirty. . . 3. There are very few options for delivery. When cleaning the room the next day, the used tableware is not taken away; 4. The Internet is very slow, and the network cable in my room is broken. It took a long time for someone to change it; 5. The room I lived in was on the back of the street. It was supposed to be a quiet place. It happened to be a large construction site at the back. It was in the middle of the night. There was a pile driver working hard at two o'clock in the evening. The hotel had almost no sound insulation. I slept with my ears covered both nights; 6. At 11:30 in the middle of the night, a waiter suddenly rang the doorbell and quickly put on his clothes to open the door, but said that he had pressed the wrong door. . . . . . . . . Crazy; 7. Speaking of the most hateful place, when I checked out, I forgot a headband and a packaged incense burner. Because I was on a plane, I called and said that I would go back a few days to get it. The next week, my colleague Get it for me, saying that the hair band and the orange were put together and it was broken? ? ? (It sounds disgusting) What about the incense burner? The hotel told my colleague that they would take the initiative to contact me. So far, a few weeks have passed and no one has looked for me! What kind of hotel is this! Every time I stay at the hotel, I always feel satisfied and dissatisfied, but Shenzhen Airlines is really disgusting to me this time. Looking back on it carefully, there are basically no hotels. Don’t stay. The price is not cheap. I have stayed in Shenzhen more than this cost-effective hotel, and the price of Ctrip is not cheap. It is said that many units have negotiated prices, which is not cost-effective to think about. Hotel feedback April 29, 2008: Dear customer: Hello! Thank you very much for your sincere criticisms and corrections during your stay on the improper service of the hotel. The hotel apologizes for the inconvenience and physical and mental discomfort caused by improper work of some employees. After the hotel leaders learned of your opinions the first time, they criticized and educate the parties concerned. The hotel sincerely invites you to visit the hotel again during your next visit to Shenzhen, and give us the opportunity to apologize in person. At the same time, the hotel also hopes that through its own continuous efforts, you can get your recognition again. 
1	1. The appearance of the screen is more beautiful, better than the one I bought before. 2. The performance is good, enough for general office use. 
1	Beautiful, very well prepared. Love at first sight is not enough. The price is acceptable. The delivery company is not satisfactory when it arrives soon. 
1	"The book ""Taipei Palace"" is a literal documentary, divided into several parts. If you watch the documentary first and then read the book, you will find the contents of the first two or three parts familiar, because most of them have already been seen in the documentary. I personally think that the latter part of the book is very beautiful. It introduces some short stories about the most famous cultural relics of the National Palace Museum in Taipei and some characters related to the National Palace Museum in Taipei. While reading books and introducing cultural relics, you can also watch them together with documentaries, which is a good combination of vision and feeling. If you read the book first and then watch the documentary, you should know what is the focus of the documentary. "
0	The room can only be regarded as very average. The facilities are quite old. The service level at the front desk has a big problem. There is no pre-authorization, the two-day rent needs to be settled first, and a deposit must be paid. I live in so many hotels in China and abroad, but I have not encountered To this kind of thing. The location is ok! But at this price, there are many other choices in Shenzhen. I will not arrange customers to live there in the future. 
0	Personally, I don’t think this book is very good...the graphics are pretty, but the content is nothing, and the price drops a bit quickly 
0	Can't stand it, basically all the voices next door can be heard clearly. Because I didn't sleep next door, I couldn't fall asleep either. I've seen a poor soundproofing, but I have never seen such a bad one. I heard a taxi driver say that this Home Inn was transformed from a factory building. There is really a question: economic hotel, who is economical? 
1	I snapped it up at 4399 yuan. High configuration and low price. Good deal. The overall appearance of the fuselage is relatively stable, and the workmanship is still very strong. The configuration is also relatively high. Able to cope with some major applications now. And it is thinkpad after all. The heat dissipation is okay. The keyboard feels okay. It is a bit heavier than the T series, but the price is there. . . 
0	"My language level is limited, and I don’t know whether ""collusion"" and ""communication"" are common. I see the former used in several places, and sometimes use the latter. The story was written in general, at least after I read ""Up and Down"", the story seemed less exciting and attractive. It's nothing more than a story about a girl who used every opportunity to improve. The characters are not well written enough to give people a deep impression, and the story has no ups and downs. It is relatively plain. Many people come in this way in their lives. Maybe it has something to do with my own work. The plot, story, and scenes in the book are all too familiar and not new. I just don't like this book. It has a certain effect on newcomers in the workplace. "
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
0	Heat dissipation technology, roll cage, metal hinges, closure buckle, alloy body, even Thinkpad’s Little Red Riding Hood is copied and turned into a little blue cap. 
1	Check in on March 12. The price is convenient, it is relatively high in Harbin, and it is an older hotel with relatively old facilities and poor sound insulation. The front desk was actually pretty good, not as shabby as the buddies in front said. After communication, I am quite willing to serve customers well. No harassing phone calls at night. It should be said that if you think the price is right, it should be considered a good hotel. There is a starting fee of 8 yuan from the train station. If you are at the airport, take the bus from the door to the train station, and it only costs 20 yuan, and then take a taxi. The traffic is quite convenient, Qiulin is just a short walk away, which is great. It's also good to go to the far building for dinner. 
0	"Generally I am lazy to evaluate the hotels I have stayed in. This time I chose ""Jintai Haibo"" because the new company is just across the street. It is convenient for the map. However, after staying for 3 days, I was too disappointed, I think Don't vomit: 1 The hotel's front entrance is on the back of the road. The first time I take a car, I will drive to the front of the road. It turns out that it is a overgrown parking lot! 2 I ordered a large bed non-smoking room on the Internet. When I checked in at the front desk, I told me that there was no more, and gave me a standard room without carpet, but I added more than 100 and replaced it with a deluxe standard room! 3 The deluxe standard room is on the 8th floor, the corridor is ultra-narrow, and the end is close It's just a big conference room. I haven't gotten up in the morning. It's noisy outside. There are different meetings going on for 3 days! Go out and look at it again, it's a public toilet! 4 Get up late, ask the waiter to clean the room at 4 pm, and then go out. I came back at 8 o'clock in the evening for more than 4 hours, but the room was not cleaned, and I wanted to find someone to scold it~~ 5 Because it was close to the road, even if you closed the window at night, you could still hear the whistling sound of the car outside, which was quite noisy! 6 I am more afraid of heat. Beijing is also very dry and hot these days, but after 1 o'clock in the evening, there is no air conditioner. It turns on around 7 o'clock. TMD, they turn off the air conditioner at night~~ The windows are noisy, no The window is hot, what can you do? 7 The waiter's name is a tear! It doesn't matter! "
1	The configuration is reasonable, the functions are complete, the wine red is beautiful, the keyboard is very flexible, and the hand feels good. The current price is also good, no bright spots and dark spots were found. Jingdong delivery is fast enough. 
1	I have read 3/4 of this book since I bought it, and I think it is still very good, but it turns out that I just feel good about myself. Originally I bought this book for my sister. I think she often complains. I want her to see it and change it. I read it by myself before showing it to her. Now I realize that I am also a complaint about her actions. Also change your own practice. Savour carefully, the world is actually very beautiful, just from our perspective. . . A very good book, because it was written by foreigners, a lot of logic is different from that of Chinese, but there are many words in it that are really right. 
0	1. The shell piano paint is a fingerprint collector to be precise. Remember that the fingerprint collector is not a fingerprint reader. 2. There are bright spots when I bought both of them. There is nothing to say, I said that my character is poor, I admit it. 3. Light leakage from the side of the LCD screen, which is obviously a workmanship problem, which is more serious than the colleague's Shenzhou 
0	I don’t know if all the books are the same, the CD-ROM drive is not very useful, sometimes it can be read, sometimes it is not~~ 
1	I took the book home for two days, and my daughter stuck to me and read it to her. She loves it! I'm glad too! ! ! 
1	I heard that it is the best hotel in Liuzhou. It turned out to be the guest house of the municipal government. It is close to a river and has a good view. The traffic is also OK. The room does not leave any special impressions, but I think the waiters in the Chinese restaurant on the ground floor have a special attitude Well, diligent, kind, and sent hot towels several times for the meal. 
0	No package is not very convenient, customer service calls will never get in, busy in the first queue waiting state, hope to improve 
1	The appearance is OK, the overall configuration is good, the XP system has been changed, the appearance is OK, the overall configuration is good, the XP system has been changed, the appearance is OK, the overall configuration is good, the XP system has been changed, the appearance is OK, the overall configuration is good, the XP system has been changed, 
1	This is a story about twin brothers and sisters. The unfortunate twins met a loving couple. Although they had also experienced hardships before, the train that they had never had a chance to catch was unexpectedly smelled after they got lost early in the morning. With the strong smell of meat, it was not only the twins, but also me that moved! I believe that it is not only the plot of the story that attracts readers, of course the plot is also quite exciting! When I commented on the book, I chose to suit it. In fact, this book is not only suitable for underage children, but also a mentor and helpful friend for adults! 
1	"I have watched the TV series ""Double-Sided Tape"" before, so I bought ""Snail House"" and looked back. After reading it all at once, I was feeling why it was a tragic ending. When I was in college, I always thought that there was only black and white in the world. After entering the society, I found that more areas were gray. Song in the novel, except for his married family background, is so good with seaweed. Seaweed is also under Song's care, fully satisfying spiritual and material satisfaction. Although Beckham's departure was disappointing, he thought it would end with great joy, but morally tells us that mistresses can never live with joy. Looking forward to the TV series version of ""Snail House"" "
0	More bulky, poor mobile performance! There is 3.2kg without battery, plus 6.25kg in the package and outer package, so it is not ordinary tired when picking up the goods. . . 
0	"""Different Carmela"" is indeed different! With so many books at home, my son has a soft spot for them. Take it off the shelf when it's okay, and read it by yourself. Or just ask me: ""I'm Carmela, who are you mother?"" Let me play the story in the book with him, over and over again, without getting tired of it. It can be seen that this book has been deeply imprinted in his young heart. This is a different book! "
1	William O'Neill's classic work; a friend said after reading the book I bought; it is not applicable to our domestic A-share market. I just read a few chapters and it attracted me! The weakness of human nature does not distinguish between countries and cultures ~ combined with my own experience in stock trading in 1989-the scene described in the book is like what I have experienced before and now! Why didn't I read O'Neill's book a few years ago? Many theories in the book are of great reference to our retail investors. highly recommended! 
0	First, the battery life is a bit shorter, and four cores are still less; second, the head is bigger, it is really recommended to remove the borders around the screen and keyboard; third, 1G memory is less, and it takes a long time to switch the machine; Fourth, after a short period of time, the right side of the touchpad became hot, and the base was also hot, but it was both acceptable. 
0	When I first ordered this set of books on Dangdang.com, I told my son that I had ordered a set of books for him. There was a car in it, and there were a lot of nice things to do. My son was very happy. After the book arrived, he liked it very much. It’s because I really like this book when I turn around. I look for golden bugs in it, and I don’t want to sleep at night. 
1	The appearance is better than expected, and the design of each excuse position is more reasonable. The notebook is just enough, urgent and affordable. The sound dissipation is relatively small. 
0	Is it feverish? Actually the hard disk is only divided into one zone? ? ? ? ? ! ! What about this original version of VISTA? I need to format the hard drive after repartitioning! ! ! 
1	The rooms are clean and the service is good. Broadband internet is fast. Ideal for business trips. But one end of the corridor is always open with the door, letting in a lot of wind. The outside seems to be under renovation, a bit messy. There is a big gap in the internal environment and hope to improve. The hotel feedback May 7, 2008: Hello! Thank you for your pertinent evaluation of Dalian Yinfan Hotel! Recently, the renovation work of the main building of Dalian Yinfan Hotel has been completed. What you are referring to is the short-term project of the sports club building, which will be renovated as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued support during the renovation of Yinfan. 
0	It's too realistic. I think there should be a snack machine. It is not good to take money seriously. People should live in a simpler life, not even if they are rich and powerful, the most important thing in life is to learn how to live an optimistic life. 
0	You should install xp directly, there is no driver disk, the sound of the time drive is very loud when booting, and Jingdong does not solve it, and ask me to contact Thinkpad directly. 
1	"I have read the novel a long time ago, and I have been entangled in whether to buy it for collection. Buying, there must be people who say that it’s not just a youth novel, or that half of the fandom is not meaningful; if you don’t buy it, the past events in the book have touched me, are true, and resonate with me involuntarily; the result is still emotional victory Sensible~ Wow, when Kaka arrives, I specifically watched it. There is a disk~ (Although I prefer another version of ""Here"" in private)~ The cover of the book is a bit indented, but it's okay~ Finally, let me copy it. I don't know where the autograph came from, it can't stand the flow of years, and can't escape the boy here. ~ "
1	High cost performance, good heat dissipation, the bottom does not feel hot at all, and the fan noise is relatively small. With the addition of 1G RAM, Vista runs quite fast, and the Internet speed is faster than before, because it is still the original broadband, so it should be the credit 
0	The shell is easy to leave fingerprints. The location of the USB interface is a bit uncomfortable. You don’t even bring a mouse and bag. There is something on Toshiba’s website, but if it’s cheap, the gift will be discounted? 
1	I bought this book for my mother, but I also learned something from it. I think the biggest advantage of this book is that the ingredients used in it are easier to find for ordinary people. They are all sold in the market, the price is not expensive, and the method is easy and practical. It’s not like some books that say that the ingredients are either not sold in China, or they are super expensive and the poor can’t afford to sell them, or the methods are very particular and the condiments are hard to buy....Although the content of this book is small It’s a little bit, but in general it’s good. I hope there will be more books suitable for Chinese people in the future. 
0	A bath salt bottle worth 5 yuan is worth 40 yuan. This is not the main thing. The most important thing is that poor quality things can hurt people. I break without force. I am not a strong man. 
1	"The deluxe room is very new and beautiful. It is as big as a suite and has a special luggage room; the balcony is large, the bathroom has both a bathtub and a shower, and a small dressing room. The service is also top-notch. They are all girls who have seen the world, professional and decent. The restaurant is also very good, ""eat in Dingshan"", even the price is five-star. All in all it is a super nice hotel, designed for staying here, it is also worth coming to Nanjing once! "
0	I don’t have any gifts. I don’t even have a driver CD. Re-installing the driver is very troublesome. The recovery system partition can only burn CDs. If you need to burn many CDs, you can directly delete the two recovery partitions, and only a 200G partition Installed a VISTA, not very user-friendly 
1	The MP3 file is too big, I wanted to put it on the phone and listen to it often, but I can’t choose a paragraph. I have to start from the beginning every time, which is not very convenient! Furthermore, the CD with the book is very easy to damage, can you put the MP3 file on the Internet, and the book buyer can download the book with the serial number of the book or other online to avoid the trouble of sending the book back and forth! 
1	Stayed at this hotel temporarily during this business trip (Ctrip recommends this hotel with a higher occupancy rate). The hotel is listed with 4 stars, and the environment is good. The facilities in the bathroom are outdated and have not been replaced for at least 10 years. The bathroom area of the standard A.B room is about 4 square meters, which is quite crowded. The front desk service has reached the 4-star standard, and the restaurant service management is somewhat lacking. The standard A room of hotel contract customers is only 180 yuan (whether it includes the early condition is unknown), and there is still a big gap in the price of Ctrip. I hope that Ctrip will negotiate more with the hotel in terms of price to provide our members with better service. 
0	A bit disappointed! It's not funny at all. The so-called jokes are caused by low-level spelling errors. Although the room discount book, I still feel a little worthless. 
0	Dizzy, how can I recommend this book to children aged 2-10? I saw the first book, but there are only two concepts: 1. Not going to bed on time! 2. Getting married and having children! 
1	Is it very useful? I applied for the price guarantee. It is still very good value. The appearance is very good. It is more troublesome to install the system. The first installation of XP is very annoying, and the last installation of Vista is still very running. The cool thing is that you have to download the driver yourself. Generally speaking, it is very good value. 512 alone is also quite good. 
0	"The big words on it read: Are you giving away a beautifully signed poster with the book? ? ? Why did you only receive the book without the poster""? ? ? ? ? Return my poster! ! ! "
0	Everyone said that the beds in the Pinghu Grand Hyatt Hotel were too small. Unfortunately, I was recruited. I only saw your comments after booking. The internal facilities of this hotel are rather old, the breakfast is not good, the room is a bit small, the facilities are fairly complete, and the bathroom is also very old! Additional comments June 3, 2008: I suggest that you take more trips in Pinghu, there are more hotels with high cost performance than Grand Hyatt Hotel! 
0	I would like to provide you with my own check-in experience here for reference only. 1. When I booked the hotel in advance, I called and stated that I needed to pick up the airport, but after getting off the plane that day, my husband and my husband checked their luggage and did not look around. Find the master who came to pick us up. In desperation, I had to call a taxi myself. Fortunately, the distance was not too far. The travel company’s car only cost 20 yuan. 2. From the moment I entered the hotel, I began to regret it. This hotel is a few years old. The external and internal facilities are outdated. After entering the hotel, no waiter came to help with the luggage, passing by but turning a blind eye. 3. The room is too small and disappointing than expected. The so-called superior room can only be regarded as an ordinary single room at best. 4. The fruit is two small apples and one small banana. I haven't seen any flowers, maybe it's because they are given away for free. Don't be too fussy, it's just a gift. 5. Breakfast, maybe because it was too early to rush to Lijiang, so the waiter packed and delivered to the room, stuff like steamed buns, it can only be hunger. Although the hotel is relatively close to the airport, the traffic in Kunming is the same as in Wuhan, so I can't compliment it! Kunming Airport is also the same. Early in the morning, it feels like a train station for the Spring Festival. So remind friends, be sure to arrive early to avoid missed flights! The above is the personal feeling of staying at this hotel. I only stayed for nearly ten hours. The price/performance ratio is really poor, and it needs to be strengthened! 
0	The hotel is located in the city center, it is more convenient and the room facilities are more general. The most troublesome thing is that the city government stipulates that the outdoor temperature cannot be turned on if the outdoor temperature is less than 27 degrees. Therefore, the air conditioning is hardly turned on during the day, so we have nowhere to hide. This is a hotel, not a guest house. The rooms are not convective. If you don’t turn on the air conditioner, it can suffocate people. It’s really uncomfortable. Fortunately, the air conditioner is turned on at night, otherwise I will check out immediately. The map of this city is to be bought, unlike other hotels that are given as gifts. 
0	The son holds these books by himself, and laughs when he looks at it. This can be said to be the first book that made him so happy. 
1	The facade is too small, the room is small, even taxi drivers are not familiar with it, it needs improvement 
0	The price is more expensive than other brands of computers with the same configuration. It is more difficult to install XP, because the SATA disk chip driver is strange. 
1	The matte surface is really good, leaving no fingerprints at all; the built-in system recovery software makes people feel reassuring; IBM's workmanship is also good; the keyboard lights are pretty good, and the fan is really quiet. 
0	Hu Lancheng seems to be passionate, but in reality it is ruthless. Hu Lancheng was merciful everywhere, but did not use affection deeply. The book not only describes the love between Hu and Zhang, but also Hu Congxiao's life experience. This book promotes too much of Hu and Zhang's love, and there are more things in the book. The writing style is delicate and soft, which is suitable for middle school students to improve their writing skills by reading. I personally think that readers who prefer the plot to win the work should not waste time. 
0	Seeing the hot reviews on the Internet, I finally couldn’t help but buy it. What is it? It’s completely ostentatious. Honestly speaking, history should be written beautifully, but it doesn’t seem to be like this. Anyway, except for some fresh vocabulary I don’t think it’s good-looking and fun. The thrilling and tortuous war scenes described by him are not reflected through conflicts, but rigid, rigid, and defined. In short, it is not good-looking, not level, and meaningless. 
0	It's a bit small, the font looks uncomfortable, just get used to it! After all, it is light enough. Jingdong’s delivery needs to be criticized. Orders placed on Saturday do not arrive until Wednesday. The price is a bit expensive! 
1	Playing games and designing is OK, using XP system, 2G memory can open 3 virtual machines, you can open Adobe and AptanaStudio at the same time, plus Warcraft, it is still smooth and not stuck. Not bad. 
0	I dare not say that this book is not well written, but this is really an uncomfortable book. I don’t know whether the life of a real counselor is experiencing these uncomfortable things every day, and the heroine’s The life experience is also very quirky and lacks authenticity. I read Dr. Bi’s prose very early, and I have read a few novels, but this book is one that I don’t like very much, and some of my friends who love books also feel the same after reading it. 
1	It is good because the exercises in this book are synchronized with the school textbooks. The children in the first semester wanted to buy this book. At that time, I felt that the amount of homework in school was too large and there was no need to do more questions. The homework for the next semester of the first grade began to decrease. For the review before the exam, I bought this set of books. We don't usually do it, just do it before the exam, so that we can test the child's mastery of knowledge, and then focus on reviewing the knowledge points that are not solid. 
0	This is not a completely useless book, it can still get some inspiration. The chapters are small, and the time on the bus is good~ 
1	: The configuration is good, and the Pentium dual-core feels not bad~ The price is right. Insufficient: It is more troublesome to install the system~ Summary: Good, worth the price 
0	"This machine is not designed for windows xp. Installation (xp) is more troublesome, and after a day of tossing, I finally got it done. However, there are still shortcomings, that is, the sound sometimes has a ""pounce"" sound. The main reason is the incompatibility. Just use it now and upgrade later. "
0	The thinkpad I just bought today, not long after it was turned on and used, the AC current adapter continuously made harsh noises, and then found that the battery also made similar sounds. Many of my friends use ThinkPad, but this is not the case, so it can be determined that it is a product quality problem. 
1	Close to Gongbei Pass, standard rooms are too small, deluxe bed is good, service is good, breakfast is not good and too sloppy, others are good 
0	The memory is small, only 1G, not a discrete graphics card, no camera, and the hard disk is not 320G. The interface layout is not very convenient, but if you want to arrange it like Pop, it is estimated that the heat dissipation is not good. Those who want to pursue discrete graphics cards and cameras are not at this price. The VISTA system is very uncomfortable. 
1	The appearance is beautiful and generous, the functions are suitable for office workers, the sound is very good for the notebook, and the root memory is added, and its practical VISTA is not stuck 
0	Generally speaking, I am not very satisfied with this hotel. 1. The front desk service is terrible. It is said that it was a computer system problem, which caused the check-in for more than half an hour, and always ignored it; 2. After check-in, I found the room was not cleaned in time, and urged it several times; 3. White sheets and pillowcases They all turned yellow. According to the cleaning staff, the bleached ones are white; 4. I waited for a long time when I checked out. 5. The room type booked when I checked in was gone, and I had to pay for the upgrade. . . It is free to upgrade only after reasonable efforts. This situation did not happen in the Wuding Road house. 
0	It’s obviously out of stock but it doesn’t show up, and it’s not notified when it’s out of stock. I knew that there was no such item when I received it! Dangdang likes to lie! 
0	Very dissatisfied with this hotel, not worthy of 5 stars. First, the room attendant was not competent, the room card had a problem, and no one came out to open the door after 20 minutes. Second, the electric switch tripped... It took 15 minutes for someone to come up. Thirdly, the waiters are impolite and speak outrageously, and some receptionists at the front desk do not understand the operation at all. Fourth, and the most dissatisfied, is that as a 5-star hotel, the taxi drivers at the door randomly charge the price, we are like a fish being slaughtered... We said the price is too expensive, they even said that the price is 5 stars After the class comes out, bargaining will affect our identity.. What is the reason? We can't find a car... This is the first time I have encountered such a 5-star hotel in my stay, and there is such a lack of standard facilities. Rubbish........... Additional comments on December 10, 2007: The bed is too shameful. When I sleep, the mattress can feel the spring wire... I feel uncomfortable sleeping 
0	Haitian’s room is relatively small, because it’s in the middle, so the lighting is not very good, the facilities inside are not good, the carpet is dirty, the hot water pipe in the room I lived in is broken, but because the roommate was already asleep at the time, So I didn't change it, but I was in a bad mood. What I disliked the most was their service attitude. Because we were sorting things, we got down 15 minutes late. During this period, there was no call to remind us that we must get down immediately, but they kept questioning when we got to the front desk: Why did we get down so late? ,! The tone was very bad, and I was asked three times. The lady at the front desk asked twice, her face was stinky. Later, a man who didn't know if it was the front desk with a cigarette in his mouth, asked us again. I felt very hot at the time. I have stayed in so many hotels and I have never seen anyone questioning guests. I will never go to this hotel again. 
1	It looks beautiful, but I don’t know if it is stain resistant. This white is not piano paint, it is not easy to collect fingerprints, but it is good. The configuration is more balanced, just add a memory yourself. 
0	The first time you turn it on, you will get a blue screen, and then use one-key recovery, and then a restart message will appear, and then restart repeatedly, which is chilling! ! ! Submitted for repair, but the review failed 
0	The service attitude was very bad, except for the free water, a bottle of Yiyun received 60. It was too dark. What kind of foreign-funded enterprise meeting was held that day, it was all about the old Chinese watches and the ghost foreign-funded enterprises. Really annoying! 
1	The beach is a bit over-famous, and it is a bit farther away, and the traffic is inconvenient, but the hotel itself is very good. At the Peninsula Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui (on the side close to the Hong Kong YMCA), there is the Gold Coast Hotel’s own shuttle bus, which is free of charge (there is a charge upstairs, which may be due to poor communication with the driver). The schedule can be downloaded from the hotel's website (, other means of transportation are not recommended, this is my advice! There are supermarkets, tea restaurants and McDonald's nearby, if the requirements are not high, eating is no problem. 
0	1. Compared with the 14.1? notebook, the volume is a bit larger and can be made smaller. 2. Vista basic instead of premium 
1	Children at different ages need different education methods. I have been distressed about how to educate children. After reading this book, I really feel like finding a mentor. My wife and I like these methods, and I think they are not only suitable for These methods can still be applied to children of a few years old even in elementary school, junior high school, or adolescence. Thanks to this book, I have changed my mindset as a father, and hope that anyone who is about to become or has become a parent can read it. 
0	I bought several cartoons for my nephew. He likes this one the most, and he never gets tired of it. A plate can be watched for several hours. Repeatedly, he still laughed. 
0	Facing the street. Very noisy. The cleansers in the hotel are all handy or unscrupulous people. It seems to have stayed three times. The first two times were shampoo and a bath towel. I never saw it when I called. I probably took it away or threw it away. Because I’m not familiar with Hefei, and there’s really no good hotel. I stayed for the third time. Really sweaty! I found that the hotel’s bath towels are probably outsourced. I know that the national hotel sauna bath towel industry is very profitable . Can’t even use tap water. Unfortunately it is estimated that this wine 
1	There is no room when I booked the Seaview Garden Hotel, so I changed to this place. I was a little confused about the appearance, because the hotel is not big, but I got an unexpected surprise when I checked in: the front desk service is very warm, and the speed of cheak in is very fast. The doorman is very enthusiastic and takes the initiative to carry your luggage. If you drive, you will remember to reserve a parking space for you; the room is not small in size, the decoration is exquisite, and there is a fruit plate as a gift; the environment is a bit worse, you can't see the sea view, but from When you come out of the hotel, you cross the road and walk towards the sea. After another road, you will arrive at the famous Korean barbecue---Li Chao charcoal barbecue. Another shortcoming is that there is a KTV next to it. You can feel a little noisy at night. The overall feeling is very good, can give 4 stars. 
0	1. The double room is actually a very small room; 2. The newly decorated room is actually not new at all, it looks quite old. Additional review May 23, 2008: I stayed in a newly renovated deluxe room 
0	The direct external price of the hotel is 168, and the price of Ctrip is 160, which is only 8 yuan cheaper, which is a bit comedy. 
1	[Recommended Book] In fact, this book not only allows children to recognize time, location, color, number, taste, antonyms and experience various actions, but also various vivid animals, as well as the customs of several countries. Different scenery features. Both the 6-year-old son and the 2-year-old 2-month-old daughter like it. Of course, when I tell them, the emphasis is different. I like these books that let children take the initiative to read and read. 
1	A good article is a product. After reading it many times, I found that it is indeed a very innovative theoretical new book. The criticism method involved in the application is an excellent example of our textual criticism. 
0	This talent is sparsely learned, so I really have no patience to read the book! Zhang Ailing is a talented girl, but unfortunately I am not. I decided not to buy her books in the future because it is too profound for me! 
1	╮(╯▽╰)╭ Hey...It's finally over. There is no winner in this emotional settlement. The talented author sketched such a story, beautiful but cruel. How about losing the one you love and gaining the world? Perhaps the protagonist is forced to do so, but it is somewhat...selfish. For the emperor, it is indeed difficult for him to be single-minded. Even though the organization is exhausted, the heroine may eventually climb to a high position. However, is it a pity that he cannot be with the one he loves? This once again verifies an old saying: if you gain, you lose! See how you grasp and measure... 
0	The pre-installed system is not good. I have to reinstall it when I come back. The memory is a bit small. If it can be equipped with a 2G option, it would be great 
0	There is a very obvious shoe print on the packaging box of the computer. Imagine that the packaging and transportation of Jingdong are not operated by hands. The computer screen protector in the gift bag was bent and it was useless. 
1	Of all the notebooks I have used, only the temperature of the thikpad is acceptable to me. After 10 hours of continuous use, the keyboard surface temperature is the same as the beginning 
1	As soon as I got the book, I couldn’t help but read it in one breath. I was so touched by my heart. Reading the whole book, I actually have an urge to cry. Maybe many stories in the book, many thoughts and emotions seem to be similar, but I I was trapped in it, so at a loss, unable to relieve it, and finally found it, so kind and warm, I really have to see myself clearly, it's great to have you lead the way, many details in the book really require careful aftertaste, repeated reading, and continuous harvest. What a great book. 
1	The first time I visited after changing the signboard, I feel nothing has changed. The breakfast buffet has increased a lot. Feedback from the hotel August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support to this hotel! We will maintain the 5-star service standard as always, welcome you to stay again, and sincerely wish you good health and smooth work! 
0	I stayed in a room with a special offer, it was too bad to say, the room was so small that it was unexpectedly small, and it made such a room like the space left in the remaining corner. There is also a parking lot, which is really inconvenient, and there are three underground floors, and it is very old. I am afraid to go to the elevator in the parking lot. First time I encountered such a bad parking lot. Don't go again next time, never go. Hotel feedback August 4, 2008: Dear guest, first of all thank you for your evaluation of the hotel, we apologize for your encounter in the hotel, the hotel has a variety of other room types in addition to the special double room. You choose, if you encounter difficulties in parking, you can contact the front desk and the hotel security department, and we will solve it for you as soon as possible. We still hope that you can visit again and will give you a different feeling next time you stay! 
1	JD.com is very efficient and fast. The order placed in the afternoon of the first day will be delivered the next morning. However, JD.com's customer service is playing no-one waiting recording during the holiday, resulting in a lot of waste of phone bills. 
0	The heat dissipation is not very good. The touchpad will be hot after turning it on for a while. I bought a large fan and this radiator immediately; the keyboard doesn’t feel much when I press it, and the unrecognizable situation has not yet appeared. 
1	The Great Wall is an old brand, and this one in the photo of friends has high configuration, beautiful appearance, volume and playback are touch-type, very good, Jingdong packaging is also very solid. 
1	I think this is a book that parents and children will like. In view of the various problems that children face in life, my baby has read books. If he encounters similar problems, he will also think about what the book says, so he will not be so nervous. 
0	It does not support XP and fails to provide an upgrade website related to the product's hardware, and the downloadable drivers published on the website are not complete, and you need to find an HP engineer to send a link. 
0	This book is only worthy of entertainment and entertainment, and does not have any academic nature, because the basic science is not enough, that is, the minimum accuracy can not be achieved. 
1	The appearance is great, I like the all-black texture. The battery is really super durable. It only prompts automatic shutdown after nearly 7.5 hours of discharging (watching movies, surfing the Internet). The screen is of good quality and no dead pixels are found. The chocolate keyboard is also very useful for people with larger hands. Blind typing errors are rare. 
1	The appearance is exquisite, the operation is convenient at the touch of a button, and the software information on the official website is downloaded and updated in time. 360 has fast delivery speed and good reputation. 
0	I am very angry. I received an email about this book from Shanghai on April 23, and today it’s May 7th. I haven’t seen the shadow of the book yet, so I actually asked me to write a review... I hope it’s like buying a book on Dangdang. 'S friends are careful 
1	This hotel is really good. Staying here for 4 days gave me 3 surprises: 1. The room is bigger than I thought, and there is a sofa. 2. Fruits are delivered every day. 3. The waiter is in a conditional situation I will help you wash your clothes for free (washed a pair of jeans for me). I will stay here again when I have a chance to come to Wuxi. 
1	In addition to being a bit bulky, the heat dissipation and the screen are good. Can be used as a desktop computer. After using it for a month, I haven't found any problems. 
0	It's a bit too thick, and the keyboard feels less touchy! There is a bright spot at the bottom of the screen, which is really regrettable! ! ! 
1	The suite is very nice. The scenery is also very good. The only fly in the ointment is that the location of the hotel is difficult to find and the traffic is not very convenient. 
1	The hotel is very good value, clean and hygienic. It is especially worth mentioning that when we checked in at the front desk, the waiter saw us with a child and offered to propose that the hotel has a double bed room with a single bed, and the price remains the same, the service is warm, thoughtful, and the price Reasonable, really good choice, I will definitely choose him next time I go.

0	The biggest reason for buying this book is that I read a lot of reviews and gave a high evaluation of this book. After I bought it, I was disappointed. The first is the printing quality. Many reviews think it is very exquisite. I personally think that it should be rough in the children's books. The second is the content of the books, most of which are outdated, which is quite different from the current society. Finally, let's talk about the plot of the story. After all, it was written by a foreigner. Many plots are far from the national conditions. I wonder if reading it to a child will affect her in the future. 
0	"It should not be the first time I have evaluated this hotel. I can't add the following again: 1. The breakfast is really super rubbish, and it really feels like pig food. I don’t know which chef to hire? 2. It is still the problem of breakfast. There seems to be a western restaurant called ""Margaret's"" next to the lobby; 1>The light is very bad. Everyone hopes to have a bright environment to eat in the morning, but it is definitely not here. 2>The food is not heated by electric heating, but burning wax is used for heating/heat preservation, which makes a strong smell of wax burning in the restaurant, which makes people feel very bad; 3. I really don’t know this How can your hotel be rated 4 stars? Hey. . . "
1	The performance of the n280 is not bad and the workmanship is meticulous. I have used several netbooks, and the keyboard is the most comfortable among netbooks. wifi cooperates with my tp-link 841n to achieve 300m speed, great! For wireless driver installation, it is best to download the latest version from ASUS official website. There are three different wireless network cards depending on the batch. The SD card slot is completely submerged into the body, unlike some netbooks with a section exposed outside. This batch of hard drives is Seagate 9. The HD performance test is slightly lower, it feels normal to use, and the sound is low. The maximum screen brightness is slightly lower than other netbooks. 
1	This book explains the origin of mankind from the perspective of genetic science, which is very different from our traditional view of nation and history. According to the research of genetic scientists, the ancestors of all human beings that can be found on the earth are the same, they are the pair of African Adam and Eve. As a Chinese, it was difficult to accept it at first, but in fact foreigners did not accept it at first. However, more and more scholars, including the common people, have heard about Black Adam and Eve. Read it with patience, it's interesting. 
0	My order on January 16th, EMS cost 20 yuan per person, and it did not arrive until February 2nd. When it arrives, it is not in fucking Mandarin, it is in fucking Cantonese. Dangdang is a fucking liar. 
0	This sister is almost obsessed with this book. I don't like this bite, I have no patience to watch it. Simply praise the efficiency and quality of this book delivery. At least the quality of the book is good, better than my first two purchases. Hope to keep it in the future. 
1	It is far from the railway station and bus station, which is not conducive to self-guided travel! But the environment and service of the hotel are still good... 
1	The content of the complaint: 2009-5-22 received an invoice number: 02840189 (the order number is written on it: 4491950) and the amount is: 8591 yuan, but in fact the order number on April 9th: 4491950 should be: 11808 yuan, so Is there a problem with your financial level? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Now the amount of remittance (payment) does not match the amount of the invoice. There is no way to enter the account? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
0	This book is not as good as it is stated in the propaganda. After buying a home, I am not interested in reading it. Originally I wanted to buy it for my children to learn English. After I got the book, it turned out to be Chinese with English words. I don't agree with this method of learning English words out of the article. 
1	"The time span is relatively long, with the rough fate of the Fugui family as the main line, telling the experience of Fugui and his family through decades of ups and downs, and the experience of different years, revealing the epitome of an era, from the war of liberation to the Great Leap Forward By the Cultural Revolution, in the end, their lives had become numb, and they had lost too much. Facing life, they probably only remained ""alive."" The novel reveals a compassionate and sad black humor. It condenses history into personal destiny, and the personal destiny of life like an ant can only be the pain of life in vain. Just be alive! A very good book, don't miss it. "
1	High cost performance! Now I don’t see it anymore! Fortunately, I shot myself! I used it very well! I just don’t know why there is no permission to enter the network 
1	The environment in the room is still good, but the Internet is a bit expensive, 12 yuan an hour, and road repairs at the door, the front environment is not good 
0	I am 30 years old and my parents are old. I wanted to buy a book that would help my family stay healthy, but I was disappointed. I think it is more suitable for people who work as a foot therapy or masseur. Also, the questions asked by netizens are individual cases, but the length of the publication is so large that it feels like being cheated and wronged. 
1	"This book was also tempted by overwhelming comments (too follow suit, this problem is not good), when I read it, I always think this is Zhang Ailing’s autobiographical novel, so I put every character in the book It satisfies the desire for voyeurism, and does not appreciate the language of the article and other things that should be paid attention to. Such a reading mentality is very bad, very bad! ! ! In general, this is still a good novel. ""This is a passionate story. I want to express the thousands of times of love, and there is something left after it is completely disillusioned."" "
0	Believe what you think is right in the book. If you think something is wrong, it is best not to believe it. If you believe in the book, it is estimated that everyone has early cancer! There is also acupuncture points that are not easy to find for ordinary office workers! 
1	Absolutely located in the center of the city, opposite the lilac lotus, next door is the Wang Yipin main store that sells the best Hupen. 5 minutes walk is the most lively Hongqi Road, the deluxe double room is reserved, because 
0	"Yu Dan turned a blind eye to the many dregs in ""The Analects"" and touted it as a guide to life, but he had to admit that the good side had some truth. "
1	The service attitude is good, but it just procrastinates. The location is relatively convenient. 
1	This time staying in Tsim Sha Tsui East is actually not very inconvenient. It is not far to walk to Midun Road or to Harbour City. It is very close to the Avenue of Stars. The room is a side sea view room, not bad, very clean and large in size. Two small pieces of chocolate are given out every day. There are welcome fruits. The lobby of Grand Harbour View is relatively small, which makes people feel less than five-star. The service and breakfast are not bad, and the surrounding environment is good. In addition to the sea view, it is also close to the park. It is more comfortable than living near Harbour City. 
0	1. The battery is relatively poor. It takes less than 9.5 hours and the craftsmanship is not good. If it is charged to 100%, it still shows charging instead of automatically stopping charging. 2. The speed of N280 is not good, whether it is starting up or running, it is relatively slow. Cunjian3, 2G standard configuration for internal negotiation 4. Books do not dissipate heat. 5. The adapter is very hot 
1	I went to Dandong in late June and booked a 2-day stay at Dandong International Hotel on Ctrip.com. Arriving in Dandong in the evening of the 24th, I took a taxi to the hotel. Dandong is not a big city. When it comes to international hotels, drivers know it. The hotel is located on a small, unremarkable street, and the surrounding environment is average. When I asked at the reception desk, the receptionist said that he had not received the booking form from Ctrip. I showed them the Ctrip confirmation message received by the mobile phone, and the receptionist said that's okay, just stay at the Ctrip reservation price. I said, could you give me a room facing the Yalu River, the receptionist checked the computer and said it was OK, but the room was a bit smaller, I said it didn't matter, anyway, I live alone. The arrangement is on the 15th floor (the receptionist really meets the guests’ requirements for watching the river). After entering the room, looking out the window, the winding Yalu River is right in front of you. The houses and farmland on the North Korean side are also clearly visible, slightly far away The Yalu River Bridge is faintly visible! The room is a bit old, but the bed and quilt are tidy and clean. The price/performance ratio of this river view room should be great value! I think that the international hotel was probably one of the best in Dandong back then. Looking at it now, the decoration is not as good as the newly opened one. The lobby is not very bright, and the elevator entrance on the floor only has a small part of lighting, but the service is not bad. The waiter will greet the guests. Especially worth mentioning is the revolving restaurant on the 23rd floor, which can be compared with the revolving restaurant on the top floor of Shenzhen International Trade and Shanghai New Jinjiang! After all, it was in a small border town like Dandong. The 20 yuan buffet breakfast is more generous, plus you can face the Yalu River and enjoy the exotic scenery (although it is the scenery of farmland and sandbank). The 2-day stay at Dandong International Hotel still left a good impression on me. 
1	The dark blue piano paint has a stylish appearance, the whole machine does not look too thick or heavy, and there are many interfaces. The design and quality of the mold are okay. The mirror LCD screen is quite clear and bright. The operating speed and configuration are also in line with the production level introduction, reaching the expected level. 
1	1. Big brand, trustworthy. The invoice warranty card is complete, and the warranty is two years. After-sales service should be guaranteed. 2. The workmanship is good, the screen is very good, and there are no dead pixels. 3. Small size and easy to carry. 4. Comes with XP home version system, with operating system recovery disk and driver CD inside. 
0	The heat is still quite large, depending on the configuration, the inter configuration of the same level is at least 5500+, bear it... 
0	There is no system, no random software, no bag and mouse, but the price is almost the same. When I use it, there is always a clicking sound near the computer switch. I don't know why, I hope it will not affect the use. I also have a sluggish response after ordering a menu command. I don't know why. 
1	The room is OK, the special suite is very good, but the restaurant is too dirty and the breakfast is out of appetite. 
0	For me, December 10th is my hardest day. A four-star hotel does not turn on the air-conditioning at night when the temperature is only 13 degrees, and it is the hotel's regulations (internal documents), which is really unheard of. I don't know if the air conditioner is not turned on because there are no guests, or the guest is not turned on because the air conditioner is not turned on. I hope the hotel will reflect on it. I just want to suggest that Ctrip abolish the hotel’s agreement as soon as possible, so as not to suffer other guests and affect Ctrip’s reputation. Platinum VIP who froze all night 
1	Since I started reading books about family education, I don’t know how many books I have read. But so far I think this is the one that touches me the most. The reading in the book is the magic wand of learning, and I am most moved. My daughter is in the first grade this year, and her study is easy. She can read novels by herself when she is in middle work. Many people once asked me, when did your daughter know so many words? I have always been surprised, where did she know so many words? After reading this book, I realized that she learned it by reading the story. I write so much to say that this is really a rare and good book! 
0	Don’t have too many shortcomings. The most annoying thing is that the DOS machine cannot be installed directly with Vista. I was busy with this machine for two days. 
1	"It’s a good hotel. If it’s a problem, the hotel attendant knocked on the door when I didn’t open the ""Do Not Disturb"" twice. Before I reached the door, they opened the door without authorization. Haha, I will stay in the future. , Especially those who are doing sensitive things should pay attention! ! Additional comments July 2, 2008: When I booked a room online, I added that the requirement was ""15F or 16F, it is better to be able to see the room in Liujiang"". The room arrangement met my requirements. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable comments on our service. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. We must strengthen staff training to avoid similar service errors. The luxurious viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! "
1	1 Piano paint, very slippery and shiny. 2 LED wide screen, looks very cool 3 buttons are very comfortable 4 activity gifts 
1	Good-looking appearance, suitable for girls. Solid workmanship, gorgeous screen, good stereo speaker sound quality, low heat generation of the whole machine, good heat dissipation. Low sound during operation. 
0	That is to say, some things that people think that everyone doesn't know are popularized, that is, the position is moved up so little to the newcomers who are suitable for edifying the workplace. . . 
1	Like Weiwei's bravery and dare to love and hate, what kind of courage is it to make her so obedient? Chen Xiaozheng always thought that no matter when he arrived, Wei Wei was always waiting for him, but how could he understand how many times of self-comfort and expectation Wei Wei needed while waiting? What he gave to her, I felt like dependence. Because of habit, I have dependence. Even if he is willing to give up everything for a few years later, I can still tell whether it is love or a man's desire to conquer it. Weiwei is so persistent! 
1	The room is ok (I live on the 21st floor), but the air conditioner is not very good-the temperature is not well adjusted and the noise is not small, and the shower water volume is not very large. In addition, there are too few elevators in the hotel, only two can be used. It takes a long time to get to the elevator every time. I don't expect to live again next time 
0	Breakfast sometimes ends at 8 o’clock, it’s inconvenient to swipe your card, you have to press cash, and the room is not cleaned in time 
1	The overall appearance is much better than the photos, and the shell also has an anti-fingerprint design, and the heat generation is also acceptable. 
1	I read other people’s reviews after I made a reservation, and I immediately felt a little nervous and even wanted to cancel the reservation. After the real check-in, I found that no netizens reported so badly. The room facilities are okay, the lighting design is more comfortable, broadband Internet access, free toll calls, room service are all good, and breakfast is also ok. The road is indeed being built in front of the store, but it is not that scary. The double-glazed room I live in is completely soundproof. Of course I live on the 15th floor. Taking a taxi is not that difficult, as long as it is not in the morning and evening peaks, it is still more convenient. There are plenty of dining options around, but you have to go in the right direction. The price of 368 is indeed not low compared to the consumption level in Anhui, but overall it is still a choice. 
1	"It is close to the Chuansha Highway, but the bus directions are wrong. If it is the ""Cailu Line"", it will be very troublesome. It is recommended to use another route. The room is relatively simple. "
0	Hotel facilities and environment are very poor, very uncomfortable, very dissatisfied! 
1	There are a lot of prescriptions for external application and internal adjustment. I am pressing an article in the book to treat acne, looking forward to the effect. I think it would be great if some prescriptions could add more detailed usage methods, such as how many times a day it would take to apply the face. There are many topical masks and face wash powders in the acne article. Although the classification of acne is introduced at the beginning, it does not explain which acne is suitable for or all acne. There is also a shortcoming that eating medicated diet should be divided into physical fitness. The book introduces the materials, methods, and functions of medicated diet. It does not emphasize who can not eat and those who eat in reduced amounts. 
1	Compared to 1000H, the battery is not prominent. Standby time is longer. The basic functions of the netbook are all available. 
0	The location is too difficult to find, the room facilities are few, and the functions are single. As a business room, there is no computer, which is a pity~! 
1	"Fujian Shanshui Hotel 1. It seems reasonable to upgrade to 4★, and the service is good (personal reception and laundry can be delivered in a timely manner); 2. The preserved egg and lean meat porridge for breakfast is good (although the third morning is a bit mushy ); 3. The catering on the second floor is worth recommending (when entertaining customers); 4. The equipment is relatively complete, there is a chess and card room, although I did not go to play mahjong, the environment is OK; 5. The location is good, the window is actually opposite- Intercontinental hotel, but taking a taxi is much more convenient than intercontinental; 6. The internet speed of the room is good, with 600KB/s; 7. What is not enough: A. Fuzhou hotels seem to have the same problem-the room is large, but the toilet is relatively small. Especially the size of the toilet...; B. There is no business package for the catering on the second floor, and the result is wasteful (calculated at 50 yuan for a single person). This suggestion has been given, and I don’t know if it will be improved. C. The sound insulation of the room windows is relatively poor . I live on the 16th floor. A small typhoon hits the first day and the windows shook overnight. During the second day and the third day, a car sirens downstairs went into the sky like a seizure...Fortunately, there is a small speaker in the room, which is turned on to 3/4 of the volume to play rock and roll, and it feels pretty good... D. Obvious problems: When the checkout was over at noon on the 8th, there was only one person at the checkout place (and still busy counting the ""bill statement""), but there were three people at the reception desk at the same counter. There were no Check-in guests, but the 3 people received were ""indifferent""... (In order to rush back to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, I had to ask them to expedite or come to help by one person) As a result, I encountered problems with card swiping. I’m not in a hurry, but the one at the checkout will only swipe the card from left to right n times (completely ignoring the system’s ""error reminder""). I reminded me again and again to read ""please see what the error message is."" The balance is insufficient. I had to go back to the room and the business center to transfer the funds twice. The result was that the card was incorrectly swiped. After I came back, I asked the bank counter for consultation and found out: because the card was swiped too frequently in a short time, the bank protection locked the card... Actually: noon It was originally when there were a lot of Check Out people (from the beginning of the checkout to the end of the checkout, there were four guests checking out, but no one was checking in), the front desk staffing was obviously unreasonable; if the lesbian at the checkout was more careful, When you find that there is a problem with the card swiping, read the tips more, it will not delay the guests so much time, and will not cause the card to be locked (the good color is like an arrow to watch the opening ceremony, CheckOut 1 hour in advance, otherwise...); When you have a problem, please calm down and deal with it. It's actually more anxious than me (especially her voice is high, sharp and fast). If I am as anxious as her, it will be blamed if I don't fight... Of course, the hotel service From the beginning to the end, including the final handling of the card problem, I knew that I would change to another receptionist to handle it. The service attitude is still acceptable. Generally speaking, this hotel is still worth recommending, and I hope to make further progress. Finally, the price of Ctrip is a bit more expensive than the price I heard at the front desk. Although I accepted the price difference and moved in, Ctrip, please come on! "
1	N280 is a lot better than N270, but the most important thing is that the battery life is really long. It’s no problem to surf the Internet and watch movies for 7 hours, one word, cool! ! ! 
1	I have studied English for more than ten years, but I have been dissatisfied with half a bottle. After working for a few years, I felt the importance of English and learned it from a friend. She has many years of English teaching experience (mainly teaching people like me who have studied but did not learn well and have worked). When selecting teaching materials, she read all the materials on the market, and finally chose this one. Her reason is that this textbook is very close to reality from the choice of character names to the choice of situational conversations and sayings. For example, many American girls are now called EMILY, and the protagonist in the conversion is also called this name in the book. Now I have finished studying 1, and I am studying 2. 
0	The xp driver is incomplete and hard to find. You can only use Driver Life 2009, Driver Wizard 2009 is not that good! Few special function keys and fingerprint recognition driver 
1	The configuration is good; it took three hours to dissipate heat and is very satisfactory; the appearance is also very stylish, small and mobile, compared with the 14-inch big book 
0	Why is the delivery so slow? My order on the 17th hasn't arrived yet? I'm eager to use these books and hope they can be delivered before this weekend. Thank you. 
1	I took my baby to play in a friend’s community yesterday. A worker is planting trees, and the baby is watching intently. The mother told the baby that they are planting trees. The baby did not say a word. After a while, Dad came over, and Dad asked what they were doing. The baby said that they are digging for treasure. Haha, the baby must have remembered the story of Frog digging for treasure with the bear. Thanks to the cute little frog Frog for giving the baby a rich imagination and a colorful and beautiful world. 
1	The first part has been read, and I am full of expectations for the second part. Closing the book, Sheng Xuanhuai, Zhang Jian, Rong Zongjing, Song Hanzhang, Tan Kah Kee, Fan Xudong, Lu Zuofu,...the familiar names flashed through my mind one by one. If these people who have made different forms of contributions to the country and nation know that in today’s materialistic modern world, there are still people who spread their names and deeds among the readers and commemorate us, and their spirit in the sky should also Feel relieved! 
0	To sum up, women want to be realistic. Either marry a good husband, or seize the opportunity to have a career... This is what she said. 
0	I ordered this book a month ago, but it is out of stock. I haven't received it yet. I haven't left a message to tell me when I can ship it or return it. I am not very satisfied with your service! ! ! I haven't found a place to ask questions for a long time, so just write it here, and deal with it as soon as possible! ! ! 
1	The hotel is not bad, the price is affordable, and the service is in place. I recommend it! 
0	I don't understand why the machine was produced in June, some of the drivers are not up to date, and the wireless Internet is intermittent, and it is normal after updating the drivers on the official website. The battery life did not introduce the said 8 hours. 
0	The real Lust Caution article is very short, only more than ten pages, and the remaining two hundred pages are all famous articles before Zhang, so purchase carefully 
1	The appearance is old, the parking lot is small and messy, and additional money is charged, but the hotel is clean. 
1	I will finish reading the book as soon as I see it today. As a book that tries to preserve the experience of the client, the content is intermittent, but the connection is very good, and the biggest feeling is that it can be used as a book. The first is about the culture before and after 9/11. To understand briefly, the second is that you can use this book as an index and expansion of your in-depth understanding of 9/11 culture. After reading this book, I have a desire to learn more about the Pulitzer Prize. This is also the third harvest of reading this book. 
0	Deceived! As soon as I got it, I knew it was not Hu Lancheng's original work! Still so expensive! hateful! In order not to spoil my feeling! I decided not to watch it! Going to find someone to sell it someday! So I bought two Hu's books again. How can I say not to spoil my feelings? Sure enough, the literary talent can't bear to let go, but why there are always mountains and rivers this book out of stock out of stock Helpless! 
0	This hotel does not have a restaurant. The waiter asked us to eat at their Tiantianfu restaurant, which is 4 kilometers away, but we were killed. Don't be fooled by those who stay in again. Additional comment on November 24, 2007: This small hotel is very poor, you must not stay in this hotel again, although you can see the sign on the house far away, but when you reach the room, you can find it after turning 3 times He was punished by the police for violating traffic when he did not enter the small door. When I finally arrived at the house, it was a mess, with construction waste everywhere, cars inaccessible, and nowhere to park cars. There is no restaurant in this hotel, and I can’t find a place to eat after walking for 1,000 meters. There are big shopping malls and shopping shops everywhere. The facilities in the room are very old. The white towels have changed to yellow and they are not replaced. The towels are all threaded around, and even a few holes are broken and we still wipe our faces. I feel sick when I think about it. How can Ctrip recommend us such a small hotel where migrant workers don’t live in? It’s too irresponsible. Hurry up and delete it from the room list. 
0	It’s okay to talk online as a personal experience, but it’s a bit too much to publish the book, and there are some obvious fallacies in the book. But the writing style is not bad, I suggest writing prose. 
0	Much more expensive than Y450, I personally think that 450 is the most cost-effective. The strange thing is that the smaller the size, the more expensive. 
0	The Vista system still doesn't work well. It is very troublesome to change to XP. It is recommended not to install it by yourself if you don't know much about the computer. I have studied for a long time before finally changing to XP. I feel very fulfilled. 
0	I think it’s the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. The rooms on the first floor are close to the basement, the air is not good, and the hotel is still being refurbished, the paint smell is very bad....It’s not 7 o’clock in the morning, the construction staff and service The staff was so noisy in the corridor...Moreover, the location of the hotel is hard to find, in the alley! ...In short, the impression is very bad 
0	The graphics card is a bit smaller, if only 512M is available; the CPU shows 1.6G in the Super Rabbit hardware test, but the CPU-Z test is 2.4G, I don’t know what happened. Moreover, the computer cut the price by 400 yuan as soon as it received it, and also sent anti-virus software, which is a pity. In addition, the heat is larger. 
1	"For me, there is nothing happier than reading a good book. The ""Women's Life Bible"" is a book that I don't want to stop when I open it. I am fortunate to be able to read it at the age of twenty-five. Author I very much agree with the viewpoint. I always think that I am a person who is very sensible to life. When I read this book, I think I still lack the wisdom of life, free and easy but lack of balance. This takes time to polish and I need to be serious. Consider this question. This book is worthy of collection and is also a book that I highly recommend to my friends. It is a good gift to my girlfriends! "
0	The only difference from buying a laptop in Zhongguancun is that you have to install the system yourself. I didn’t know when I bought it at first. I thought there was a quality problem and couldn’t boot it. Later I found the customer service and found out that it was because there was no system installed. , Save yourself trouble! 
0	I didn't even receive the goods, and later I didn't know who I could find to solve it. I just gave the money for nothing, but didn't receive anything, what should I do 
0	1. There is a strange smell in the old standard room, and I changed to a single room of the same price. The newly renovated single room feels bad, the bathroom leaks, and the roof leaks; 2. The corridor to the room is too long; 3. The checkout is too slow and you have to wait. 
0	1: As long as the fan is used, it keeps spinning. 2: The hard disk has noise, which is very harsh. 3: Color difference can be divided into warm and cold colors. We are adapting to warm colors in the south. My color is cold. It doesn't matter if it is a normal cold color, but my color is not generally cold. The color of the screen is affected, can I exchange it? 
0	Service attitude is very poor. The booked room told me that I didn’t have it. I said that I had secured it with a credit card, and the waiter resolutely said that I had not received it and I had no money to go. 
1	I bought 2 sets at once, and my colleagues had one by themselves. . . feels pretty good in general. . The battery is durable, the screen is good, and the keyboard is easy to use. 
1	All kinds of inspirational and successful books are abundant. I have read a lot over the years, and then I simply stayed away from this kind of book. Because, this kind of book is often self-hypnosis, and all kinds of tricks, which give people wisdom, are really rare. However, Teacher Zheng's book runs through the wisdom of Buddhism, integrates the feelings and confusion of modern people, and helps people to transform their knowledge into wisdom. After reading it, it makes people feel warm and at the same time strengthens the judgment of wisdom. The humanistic education of Taiwanese, the education of traditional culture, and the care for people's inner world may be more advanced than that of the newly rich mainland. 
0	This hotel is like a guest house. The room smells musty. The hot water for bathing must be opened for 10 minutes. The bathtub is small and pitiful. The facilities of the room are rudimentary. , The cover of the toilet is a circle smaller than the toilet. I don't know why Ctrip signed an agreement with this kind of garbage hotel. I won’t go live for the second time even if I’m killed. Summary: Bad! Bad! Bad! 
1	There is no sauna equipment, the reason is that it is being repaired, but the real reason is not making money. 
0	I just stayed here and I feel bad. The room smells too big and has a musty smell. The facilities in the room are very outdated. The double room I booked did not have broadband, so I could only live in a double room. I was a little hungry because I was late when I went there. After searching the room for a long time, I only found an empty display refrigerator. Such an old hotel has not been renovated yet, and it is estimated that there will be no repeat customers. The good point is that the environment is good, but in Hainan, there are still many garden-style hotels like this, which do not constitute a feature. If someone comes to Yangpu, it is recommended to live in the Seaview Garden Hotel, which has a four-star design. The corridor at the door of the room faces the sea, and the whole is a garden layout. If you want to take a bath, you can take a tricycle to dry it (transliteration), which is only a few kilometers away. The price is also very reasonable, 238 yuan for a bed room. 
1	"Those who grow up under the red flag will only see red, and they need to continue to use their own blood to continue to exaggerate the dazzling glitz of the predecessors to continue to promote freedom and democracy. ""Humans are born free, but they are everywhere in chains. People who think they are the masters of everything else are more slaves than everything else."" Freedom is what people want, and its original meaning is even higher than democracy. When Ferma used the proposition ""No one is born free"" to find support for the status quo of human society, Rousseau and other generations put forward the pursuit of freedom. "
0	1. My biggest regret is that the hot water is not hot. Fortunately, I didn't catch a cold in summer. 2. A set-top box on the TV is broken. I don't bother to fix it. 3. Four-star hotels don't even have Western breakfast. It's all lard, so I can only eat with cucumber and fritters. And Chinese food is really terrible. 4. The service is still ok. 5. The hotel's internal facilities are really not worthy of a 4-star title, they are too old and too bad. 6. The internet speed is not as fast as others have said, it may be blocked, and it is just normal 
0	The book was not put on the bed to read. Take it back and look at it in a hurry. Ah. . . . I just put it in the bathroom, just take a look at my convenience. It's really not practical. But the beauty shots are very beautiful, even my husband looked through it. 
1	"I have only watched ""Disintegration"" by Xixi. The impression is not deep anymore. Remember that there are few punctuations and a fast pace; or a lot of punctuations and too many pauses. She is still a more talented woman. "
1	Overall it is good, there is Jiang outside the window, and there are a lot of food around. (The people in Leshan are a bit unfriendly. Beware of blackmail. It's best to go to a few more shops to ask for the price.) What you want is a standard room of 180. The room has a lot of space. Although it has some achievements, it can be considered worthy of his price. Breakfast I didn’t eat, and gave two small bottles of mineral water. 
0	This book formed a huge contrast with the popular TV broadcasts. I bought it as a reading book for the company's reading activities. As a result, no one finished it. It was really disappointing to write it like this. 
0	"The price is high in Changchun, but the room environment and service are completely insufficient. Paint peeling off the cabinet door in the room. I couldn't find the western restaurant at 6:30 in the afternoon. The service staff told me that it might be off work. six thirty? The lady at the front desk hung up the guests waiting for check-in, answered the phone by herself, and looked at the guests with a cold face. I asked some service staff for directions, and was told very well: ""I shouldn't care about this."" It does not have the minimum image of a so-called foreign hotel at all. The feeling to me is ""You are so annoying. Without those of you who are going to stay in the hotel, how free we should be!"" Feedback from the hotel on October 19, 2007: Dear guest, Hello: First of all to you during your stay I would like to express my sincere apologies for the unhappiness encountered. At the same time, I am very grateful for your ability to raise the shortcomings of our service reception, which is also the greatest support for our reception work. We will make every effort to improve and strengthen the training of employees to improve the quality of service. High-quality service to welcome every guest to the pavilion. In order to further educate employees, improve service awareness and service quality, and carry out targeted departmental job training through this matter, we sincerely hope that if it is convenient for you, please tell us the details of your stay at the time, such as check-in time and who Reception, etc. (If you don’t know the name of the specific receptionist, you can describe where it is, such as the check-in or cashier at the reception desk, what color uniforms you wear, etc.), we would be very grateful. And hope that you can continue to support and pay attention to us, and all our staff welcome your visit again! "
1	His two-and-a-half-year-old son has always liked to post books and has bought a lot. I personally think this is the best set I have ever bought. Practical skills, cognitive skills, observation skills, and enlightenment to mathematics are all included in the wonderful pictures on each page. What surprises me more is that there are content that cultivates good habits and moral qualities for children. You don't need to buy them separately now. Children like them and accept them quickly. In addition, the quality of the paper is very good, and the next few sets will definitely be bought. I deliberately write down my feelings here, hoping to help all parents who love their children. After all, it is not easy to find a good set of books for their children. 
0	The Internet broadband is not stable, and colleagues will bring a CDMA network card when they check in. . 
0	Reading this book, the original intention is to add some knowledge and understand yourself, but the result is not achieved, the text is long, the content is not like, and I feel uncomfortable~ 
1	The hotel attendant is really nice. I was intercepted by the heavy rain at the long-distance station and sent a car to pick me up after calling the hotel. The room is not flattering, it's too old and smells like. Overall the service is okay. 
0	"Although the author spent a lot of space, I was a little disappointed after reading it and felt that the money was spent in vain. In fact, most of the book is personal lyric, self-pity and self-love of little women. Cute is cute, but in terms of practicality, I think it's not as good as ""Seeking a doctor is worse than asking yourself"". In fact, the book ""31 Years Old"", one of the few essence thoughts, comes from this book ""Seeking Doctor"". The rich content, the rigorous logic, the fluent and interesting writing, the profound knowledge and the objective explanation of ""Seeking Doctor"" are beyond the reach of this book. If you have ""Seeking Doctor"", you don't need to buy this book. "
0	It was rebuilt from an old building. The decoration is very new, but there is no carpet on the floor in the room, and it feels cold. The soundproofing of the partition wall is very poor, and the sound of making love next door makes it impossible to sleep at night. There are too few TV channels, only five. The network bandwidth is too small to send and receive emails, downloading things is a dream. The price is fairly cheap. 
0	The LED screen has bright spots, and it is at the bottom right of the middle of the screen. You will see it when you turn it on, which is very uncomfortable. 
1	"There is no ""design in terms of design"", but in the explanation of ""design thinking"", the essential source of design and the ultimate service object: human thinking are explained more. By explaining the human mind, people understand ""why it should be done"" rather than just ""how it should be done"". It is a book that explains ""the way of design"" rather than ""the art of design"". The translation is also good. A lot of inspiration and benefit. It is more helpful for newbies in design and those who have done design for a period of time. "
1	When I opened the package and saw the book, there was a plastic bag on the outside of the book. The paper inside was comfortable to the touch. The size of the words was moderate. The main reason was that I liked the translated version of Zhu Shenghao, because I needed to read the original text. However, it is difficult to fully understand the original text, so I chose to compare it with the classic translation of the predecessors. In addition to the collection of Shakespeare’s four tragedies, this book also contains a tragicomedy that I like very much--Romeo & Juliet, so this book has become perfect in my eyes, ha ha~ 
0	1. It would be great if it comes with a genuine operating system; 2. It would be more perfect if the built-in camera and headset are even more costly. 
1	The heat is not as horrible as online, of course, the premise is not to play for a long time! CPU is enough, wait for cheaper and change to p8600. 
0	I just want to say that this book is a shameless confession of a shameless person. There were people like Hu Lancheng back then, and there are now. Greedy and turbid, selfish and shameless, and even take oneself as an onion. 
0	"Too heavy, of course it may be too light as I expected. Heat is greater. Another inexplicable thing is that the warranty on the invoice is ""none"" and the introduction is 1 year. 3 packs of cards are 2 years, seriously inconsistent. "
0	The primer of the piano seems to cause fingerprints and fingerprints. A matte surface should be better, right? Hehe, I can only stick the full film, fully armed. 
0	I am very angry. I received an email about this book from Shanghai on April 23, and today it’s May 7th. I haven’t seen the shadow of the book yet, so I actually asked me to write a review... I hope it’s like buying a book on Dangdang. 'S friends are careful 
0	Drivers are hard to find. There are many things that are not needed for the built-in drive disk. It would be great if there is a one-click driver installation like Lenovo. 
1	Although this book was published earlier, it seems to be quite profitable today, especially for the young generation. There are many principles that are only worth learning, but there are also some dark sides of human nature that require us Those who are vigilant cannot see evil and become evil, but to prevent evil. This is also the meaning that the author has been trying to explain, just like the title of the book-I am not teaching you fraud. The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. When you look at this, you have to have your own views and ideas. The bad side of society exists, but don't give up because of choking, learn how to face it correctly! 
0	The price will be reduced by 100 before the goods arrive, but the radiator will not be delivered. . . Used 2000-100 coupons. . I don’t know what brand the screen is. I haven’t heard of the brand. It was produced in the first quarter of 2008. 
1	The shell of the piano paint has a watery texture and it feels good. The configuration of this notebook is also good, and it is a reasonable match! Value for money! I installed the XP system and it runs smoothly, enough for general office use 
1	"This book has been bought for a long time, and children have read it for a long time. Recently, the child said to lend it to me, so I read the first novel-""A Woman in White Drifting in the Forest"", and there are two short stories I haven't read yet. This book is indeed very attractive. No wonder the child likes to read it so much. Later, I bought her ""Space Tomb"" and finished it. I think that the pupils who read this type of book too much will definitely become smarter and braver, because the three little tigers in the book are smart and brave children, and their behavior will definitely affect the readers. . "
1	I think the books are good, simple and clean. The performance is also good. And I like the HP brand, our desktop is also HP. 
1	This hotel doesn't feel like a five-star, it should be at a four-star level. The rooms are barely ok, but the breakfast is not well done and the variety is small. I stayed here with my colleagues and basically left after a few bites. 
1	Brand new licensed (my machine was shipped out on May 27), reasonable configuration and outstanding performance. The workmanship is ok. Also praise Jingdong, delivery is fast. . . . 
0	The whole book is about acupuncture points, at least it is not very practical for me, maybe it is useful for friends who like acupuncture points. 
1	I stayed as a family on October 20th. During a five-day tour of Beijing, from the doorman, counter reception, restaurant service, and hygiene, they are all warm, warm, polite, and feel at home. Check in and checkout are very good Timely and fast. The transportation to Beijing attractions is very convenient. The surrounding attractions are a 10-minute walk to Youmei 
1	"The book ""A Must-Read for Accounting Supervisors"" is unique. It reforms the formatting style of previous editions of this type and makes the content arrangement closer to actual work. It is a rare and good book. It is an indispensable reference book for our accountants and a good teacher and helpful friend of our accountants. As an accountant, having a book like this on hand is equivalent to hiring a good teacher for free. There is no harm in improving work efficiency and enhancing one's own competitiveness. A good ""supervisor"" can enhance the competitiveness of the enterprise (competition of talents) and turn risks into benefits. What about being happy and not doing it? "
1	I bought it for ￥15, now it’s ￥12, and it's falling so fast! I didn't catch up! :( 
0	Although the hotel is nominally five-star, I have never seen such a stingy hotel. I booked more than 3,500 premium rooms through Ctrip. I clearly saw that there are free drink coupons written on the Internet. No more than two, but only one at the front desk when checking in, really depressing! Isn't this purely false advertising! ! ! We are staying for two people, it is better not to give one, the front desk explained that another person can buy one! ! ! It's blackmail! ! ! 
1	"I bought this one after reading the previous ""Stool Book"". In fact, the two books are irrelevant. One is about gastrointestinal excretion, and the other is about energy conditioning, but they are both good. You can practice it in a few minutes every day. The poster attached inside is very interesting, but unfortunately it is on the front and back. It is not convenient to read. I made several copies and posted them in the office and home study. My colleagues followed suit after looking good. Movements and breathing are probably yoga routines. The simpler is that the illustrations are fun to draw, and the price is discounted. Haha, take it with you and take a look at the meeting. "
0	After arrival, there is a foreign body in the screen! ! It's a foreign body! Not black spots! I told Dell for repairs and said that it would take 3 weeks to replace it or find a dealer. I went to the JD headquarters for after-sales service. After the after-sales service and Dell confirmed the situation, I had to contact Dell myself. JD could not replace it. 
1	Reading it the second time recently. This book seems to show various struggles in more detail. The analysis is thorough and clear. There are many reasons that are good. For example, it is not an enemy, but a win-win situation. However, the final feeling is that this book is too detailed. The whole book did not finish a story. This makes me feel a bit annoying sometimes. Although I know that the actual situation is more complicated than the book. However, I still don't want to read a story so carefully. When reading this book, I will be tired. Because I really don't want to be so complicated. Too complicated. I am not the kind of complicated struggle person. 
1	"I bought the first volume of ""Different Carmela"" a long time ago. At that time, my daughter hadn't learned many words. I read it to her repeatedly. On June 1st, I wanted to give her a very special gift. I just saw the second part of ""A Different Carmela"" and gave her a holiday gift. When the daughter got the book, she immediately looked happily, read all three of them at once, told me the stories in the book, and commented on what happened in them. I really hope to continue to see the stories that happened between the Carmela family and their friends! "
0	I ordered the book interior design on March 24, but what you sent me was landscape design. I made N phone calls after March 26, asking for a refund. You always say that you can buy it. You can handle it for me within 2 working days. I'll wait. It's been several 2 working days. Hope for the stars. , Hope for the moon, finally on April 1st, Pan came, but change, not retreat. So I called again, you said that 2 working days, I waited several 2 working days, there is still no news, I have to complain. Soon I received a call, telling me the exact time to refund within 1 working day, which is really good. , Without a trace of hesitation. But this working day is over again, how about people, phone calls? You guys are teasing me. It’s only 86.2 yuan. As for letting you do this, it’s not annoying? 
0	The viewing angle of the screen is small. I don’t know if it’s my individual difference. As long as I don’t sit upright, I can’t remember the color, especially the dark color. 
1	The speed is faster than expected. I tried other machines in the mall and found it to be a bit slow. This is OK. The performance of the n280 may be slightly better than the n270. 
0	It’s okay for the first time. I feel that the author’s example is well written, but if you taste it carefully, it’s just rubbish. The examples are blunt. Zhuangzi will jump out of the grave to commit suicide when he sees it. Level. 
1	Light and thin, so don’t need to comment too much on X200, the bag presented is quite a range, and the leather is very business-like. 
0	The printing quality of the book is very poor, it feels like a pirated book, and many pages are blurred and look very troublesome. When the book arrived, I felt disappointed and couldn't find the feeling of reading. 
0	When I ordered, I saw a comment on the Internet saying that the wrong item was sent, and I was worried for a long time. The result was really wrong when I received the item. After I returned it, I re-ordered, I wonder if there will be a sending error, worry... .. 
1	Reading this book, I think it’s better for people to be simple. Grandma is simple and full of life’s wisdom. She never bows her head at any time, she just keeps going forward, going forward, not complaining, not worrying, just going forward. Go, go forward optimistically; Xiao Zhaoguang, who is a little slow, is simple, believes whatever grandma says, and grows happily in a difficult environment. Healthy and lively, the narrative style seems to slowly unfold the picture of life in front of them, which makes people can't help but laugh. They are sad when they are hungry and happy with their humorous words. It's a good book, it's worth reading! 
1	The location of the hotel is very good. Walking out is by the Songhua River. If you live in a room near the river, you will have a chance to see the rime by opening the window early. The transportation is also more convenient, and taking a taxi from the train station is just to skip the meter. The hotel's facilities are not old, and it feels like an old three-star hotel has been renovated. The room is relatively large, but the layout is not very good. The shower head is not big enough and always looks like there is not enough water. 
0	The fever is a bit big, especially when playing games, the graphics card is over 70°C, I don’t know if it is normal or not! About 50°C when not playing games, it's not bad! 
0	It is the worst one of all the hotels I have stayed in. When booking, I said that I would like to have a non-smoking room, but after opening the door, I was upset by the smell of smoke and various body odors. The hotel may not have a non-smoking room at all , But Ctrip didn’t even mention that it was a negligence. The facilities are dilapidated and the towels are yellow. The bed sheets and duvet cover are old, I don’t know if there is any change. The service staff are all 
0	When booking the room, it was claimed to be a sea-view room. As a result, I stayed on the 3rd floor. Not to mention the sea view, I can't see the green museum next to it. Fortunately, I don’t care about the hotel during the day. But the room decoration is large, and the night The level of 7/800 is extremely disproportionate. It is known as 5 stars, and it is on the same level as Nanjing city celebrities. Compared with Nanjing's Soft Galaxy, the gap is not small. In addition, when I left, I pulled a mobile phone charger in the room, and it was not Notify me in time, it seems that this hotel does not check the room when the guests check out. The most outrageous thing is that I remembered to call and ask if it was still there, and I only got it back today. Fortunately, I am in Shenzhen. Dizzy! I don't know how to call the customer and tell them. 
1	"The room you stayed in cannot open the window, and the air circulation is not satisfactory. It is regrettable. Hotel feedback July 10, 2008: First of all, I apologize for your dissatisfaction caused by the hotel room arrangement. At the same time, we will communicate with Ctrip in time and enter your request into the ""Hotel Guest History Information"". When you next check in, the front desk can directly arrange a room with windows that can be opened based on the guest history information. Hebei Century Hotel looks forward to seeing you again! "
1	I bought this book because I was going to study real estate analysis in the United States, so I wanted to learn about the property laws there. After I got the book, I felt that the design was very good, the cover was simple, the format was medium in size, and the font was clearly printed. After reading the first part these days, I feel that the decision to buy this book is correct. It is not a book that simply lists legal provisions, but introduces property law from a legislative perspective. In order to make readers better understand, simple examples are added after some articles. Overall, I like this book very much. 
0	I placed an order on January 7 and I received the goods yesterday, but I found that there is no one? The Beauty Sutra of a 31-year-old Little Beauty?. I did not say that it was out of stock, somehow? 
1	[Recommendation] A very cute booklet, you can take a look at it at any time, and I am in a very good mood. I put her in the office drawer and glanced at it in my spare time. I feel very comfortable and have a lot of content. I really like it. Share good things, friends who like painting should check it out. 
1	"Order 5216523 and June 3, request to process the reissue of gifts. Now it’s on the 20th, it’s still not reissued. This service is ""too in place"", right? I just leave it after I buy something? Is this what Jingdong is used to? ""Style""? Now there is a big gift package. Ask for a satisfactory result. Don't delay it!!! (And we found the keyboard problem when we got it, and it has been repaired. Only a few days after buying?) These results It's all depressing!!! "
0	I think this book is not as good as I imagined, and cannot effectively improve the memory effect. Moreover, many words are not used frequently. 
1	The price-performance ratio of the Yixing Hotel I stayed at this time was relatively high. The room was large and the layout of the room was relatively warm. The breakfast variety is too small, and the waiters have a better attitude. 
1	Overall it feels good, the standard room of 191 yuan/room is good value for money. 
1	The configuration is good, it can be dual-core + independent display less than 4K, very cost-effective. It is a perfect screen after testing, and good luck. 
0	Nothing else, but the house price is cheap. Very old star hotel, ashamed of the 4 star standard. Additional comments May 31, 2008: But this one is better in Anqing, others are either far away or worse. 
1	Access denied when partitioning, no matter how to partition, please help! How to install the 1G memory sticks? You should not be able to install it yourself 
1	The room is clean and tidy, and the service is OK. At this price, it is not bad. It is recommended that you book a room with windows, but the restaurant is not good enough. Once the mushrooms were sour, there is no supermarket nearby, which is not convenient. You have to go a long way to buy fruit, 
1	Very good hotel, except for the service attitude of the front desk. The room facilities are very good, Philips LCD TV, and computer backup. However, it may be because of the reason that the booking was made through Ctrip instead of direct booking. The location of the room is very poor. 
0	Unlike a three-star hotel, it is a 2-star hotel at all 
1	The heat control of the TM machine is better than that of home use, and the price is also very good. This configuration at this price can only be described as super value. 
1	There is nothing wrong with check-in. The front desk is arranged on the 23rd floor. It is really bad and smelly when you get out of the elevator. I still have this smell when I enter the room. I'm about to vomit. I really couldn't bear it, so I called the reception and asked for a room change. Later changed to the 39th floor. The waiter said it was an apartment building on the 23rd and 24th floor. Someone was cooking. gosh! ! ! It also shows that the hotel does not value Ctrip's customers. If it is a member of their hotel ACCOR, it will definitely not be arranged on the 23rd floor. Another strange question is, why does Ctrip always have no breakfast? There are no hotels. It feels like Ctrip ate our breakfast. 
1	I booked it for my family, there is nothing to say, the hotel in Hong Kong, just have such a price-performance ratio. 
1	I bought a notebook with this configuration at this price. There is nothing to choose from. There are many things to give away, the machine is good, and the configuration is reasonable. In addition, the camera is very clear. 
1	Snatched at 3999, this configuration is really cost-effective! The keyboard feels great! The appearance is also beautiful and the weight is right! 
0	The edge of the screen is so wide, which can save points and reduce weight. It doesn’t take long for the left keyboard to be very hot, and the cooling wind is also very hot. I still have a problem 
1	"The order placed at noon on Thursday was received early on Friday morning. In the afternoon, I took it to the computer city to install the system for 80 yuan, plus a 1G memory stick for 200 yuan. Everyone said ""value""! ! It’s just that my hands and feet are heavier. ? "
1	The service is first-rate, the bus at the door extends in all directions, the breakfast is rich, and it is worth living. I went to Xiamen for five days, two days for Jinjiang Inn, two days for Xiamen Hotel, all were good and very satisfied. 
1	I’m writing this book for my insights, errata and doubts. Friends who are interested can visit my website to exchange ideas. www.smallstonesoft.com 
0	The VISTA system can be used properly, the office2007 is not activated, and the 2003 version is changed. The keyboard is more rigid! The biggest criticism is the built-in camera~ it's just rubbish! And the whole machine is bigger than other brands, and its portability is slightly worse! 
0	Meridians do not exist, no matter you look at it with a microscope or X-ray, you can't see it. Meridians and acupoints are things that the ancient Chinese imagined when they couldn't fully understand the human body. This pseudo-scientific book is still on sale. I advise everyone to think twice. 
1	I have read Mr. Cai's book for more than ten years. I have liked him very much since he was in middle school. I still remember the days when I rushed home to watch his holidays on Sundays. In the past few years, the time has been small, and the reading is small but from time to time I will think of Mr. Cai's book. This new book is my favorite one I have read. It talks a lot about food, materials, and methods. It is very interesting. I have made the green beans in the book and have been approved by my family and friends. Covering ginger with air water is very easy to use. I sincerely recommend it~~Haha~~ There are other books about life and attitudes towards life. Sincerely recommend watching on the bus~~ 
0	A very bad hotel, I only considered staying at this hotel after reading online reviews. As a result, everything was overstated. I stayed in the 788 deluxe single room. After I checked in, I found that the hotel room was very bad, the room was very small, and the towels and bed sheets were very dirty. I feel unclean. I feel a bit cold at night. I want to have more quilts with the hotel. As a result, I was told that if I added more quilts, I had to add more money. Psychologically very upset. So I decided to check out the next day. When I checked out in the morning, I told me that I stained the bed sheet (there were mosquitoes in the night, and some blood stains on the bed sheet might be broken when I was scratching. I haven't claimed a claim from your hotel. It). So I argued with the front desk, and then brought me the sheets down and confronted the front desk. Maybe the front desk also thinks that the blood stains are nothing. Even if I ask for money, it will pass. If I insist on giving me money, I will quarrel with the front desk, but it is not enough. I will consider calling the police. Then gave me the bill and found out that I was overcharged by RMB 5, and asked what was going on, saying it was the city construction fee. I don't care if I have this fee or not, but I have been booking hotels on Xiecheng for as much as possible. If you charge any city construction fees, you can. Please add this fee to the room rate when signing a contract with Xiecheng. What the hell. Five yuan is nothing, but it makes me feel very uncomfortable. So he asked his hotel to show me the relevant regulations. As a result, the so-called lobby manager never came out after entering. Fortunately, a Shanghai friend used the Shanghai dialect to talk to them. I don't know what to say. I didn't dare to ask for the money after I came here. Later, a friend told me that the front desk said that Japanese people like to live in this hotel. Sorry, I'm not Japanese. Japanese people like it. That's someone else's business. It has nothing to do with me. If you like Japanese people, please explain to me and don't accept Chinese people. After checking out and leaving, I felt like escaping from a black shop. I don't know if Xiecheng will take care of this matter. However, if this happens again in the future, it will affect my impression of Xiecheng. All in all, a bad hotel. Now it is the off-season to dare to ask for this price, it is really crazy. Maybe this hotel is mainly aimed at monthly subscription customers, and other individual customers caught a black one. I suggest you not go to this bad hotel. 
1	The notebook is very beautiful, the appearance is good, and the configuration is good, but I didn’t pay attention when I got the goods. A small piece of paint fell off the bottom of the notebook. I thought I had already taken the notebook away. I guess they won’t take care of it. Fortunately, It's not obvious, but overall it's OK. 
0	My baby is 3 years old. I just glanced at the book set I ordered and was not interested. Maybe the pictures in the book are too messy and she doesn't like it. 
0	"This book makes people feel very disgusting. I bought it out of my head. Now she started Zhuangzi again, and she was really called ""Confucius is very anxious! Zhuangzi is angry"" I feel very sick! Simply nonsense! Let people comment silently! "
1	In fact, I bought this book by accident. I was a relative of my family. I watched TV and said that there was a book written by Wang Chenxia. The book was quite reasonable. Then I ordered a book on Dangdang. At first I didn’t think it would be much bigger. But after reading the whole book, I feel really different. Many things reflected in the palms of our hands are really closely related to our body’s diseases. I don’t mind if friends who are not in good health read this book and sometimes go Nothing can be found in the hospital physical examination, but it does not mean you are not sick. By looking at the palm prints, you can know what you should pay attention to. 
0	It's disappointing. Reservations through Ctrip should include two breakfasts. However, the main station did not give meal coupons, and the restaurant had to charge 10 yuan per person before serving meals. The faucet in the bathroom was broken. After I checked in for repair the day before, no one repaired it until I checked out the next day. The shower curtain was too dirty to see the original color. Too bad. 
0	The printed version is a color version, but unfortunately, the form is much larger than the content, and the content is really simple. I will explain here that my English level is average, the taste is poor, and there is no practicality. I do not recommend you to buy it. 
1	Many of the truths about life and life, for ordinary people like us, can only truly feel it after experiencing baptism continuously. Through the exploration of the relationship between the previous life, this life, and the next life, I have learned to learn, change, and be grateful, and make myself move in a more fulfilling direction through experience after time. 
1	As far as children are concerned, as long as they like the pictures in it, it is very good. Don't think of teaching them words through this book. This is unrealistic. 
0	After I got this book, I felt that it was far from being as good as the advertisements said. The pictures were average, far from exquisite, and the content was a bit sloppy. It was not interesting for small children, but it felt painting for older children. Too many, in short, a little disappointed. 
0	I regret that. I bought this book after receiving a recommendation email from Dangdang.com. Unexpectedly, it was full of advertisements and the author's self-promotion. I regret that I did not see the real experience of the author that I was expecting, and I also regret that Dangdang, which I admire, will bring such books to readers as recommendations. 
0	The screen resolution is low, why is it so unclear? ? ? The problem with the graphics card driver, or the problem with the machine itself? ? ? 
1	The configuration of this machine is very good value at this price, 2G 3rd generation memory, 320G hard disk, 512M alone! ! 
1	Thank you very much to the customer service staff of Ctrip's service number 84392 for helping to properly solve the mistakes guaranteed by the guest's own credit card, and the incidents that were not notified in time. I will visit this hotel again next time I have a chance to support Ctrip 
0	1. Self-equipped with 2G memory, I can’t loosen the screws. 2. There are too many startup items for VISTA system, and I dare not delete randomly. OFFEC is only 60 days. Rising that can be used on a computer cannot be used in a notebook. With 3.360 software, it pops up every time you turn on it and you have to allow it to use it, sweat 
0	From the perspective of the text of the novel, it is very general. Its success is the blessing of fast food culture and so-called success learning. 
0	I just stayed here and I feel bad. The room smells too big and has a musty smell. The facilities in the room are very outdated. The double room I booked did not have broadband, so I could only live in a double room. I was a little hungry because I was late when I went there. After searching the room for a long time, I only found an empty display refrigerator. Such an old hotel has not been renovated yet, and it is estimated that there will be no repeat customers. The good point is that the environment is good, but in Hainan, there are still many garden-style hotels like this, which do not constitute a feature. If someone comes to Yangpu, it is recommended to live in the Seaview Garden Hotel, which has a four-star design. The corridor at the door of the room faces the sea, and the whole is a garden layout. If you want to take a bath, you can take a tricycle to dry it (transliteration), which is only a few kilometers away. The price is also very reasonable, 238 yuan for a bed room. 
1	The paint panel is quite beautiful! The functions are very complete, and I'm very satisfied as a gift! Although it has not been tried. 
0	What about people who don't like this system? And it’s more balanced to give away some small gifts:) 
0	It’s just that the deliveryman’s attitude is a bit bad this time. Maybe it’s because I’m busy. I hope I can speak well no matter what. 
1	After installing the XP system, I feel that the speed is very fast, and its memory quality is very good, which is comparable to the dual-channel memory speed. The sis chipset is not so bad. The drive disk that comes with is a fool, just install it directly. The machine runs quietly and can meet the needs of most people. 
0	There is nothing wrong with the product itself, but the delivery service of Jingdong Mall has to improve the quality. The original EMS was used, but the mall neglected to change it to express delivery. Fortunately, the postage was refunded after the transaction. 
0	I have ordered a book for such a long time, I have never encountered such a book, comfortable to give to the elderly, saying that it is a gift of full-color meridian map at all. 
1	After all, it is an HP product, and the appearance and workmanship are still simple but not simple~ This configuration is really nothing to fault at this price~ No matter how low-end it is, it is also positioned in the commercial version, haha~ 
0	I bought this book for my parents. I heard it's easy to learn, so I showed them to my mothers and let them know some basic fitness methods, so that we will feel more at ease working outside. My mother is studying, and she said it was pretty good. 
1	Advantages: 1) Stand in the same yard with the bus, convenient for travel. 2) Diagonally across the street is a large stall, where all kinds of snacks and fruits are readily available. Disadvantages: the attitude of the waiter is average, and the service level needs to be improved 
1	The room area is too large, resulting in poor cooling and heating effects of low-power air conditioners, and the distance between the bed and the TV is relatively difficult to watch. 
1	It was a bit difficult to find when I first went, but the service is really good~~ and magnificent~~! Although the room is not big but I must be enough to live alone, it is very comfortable and the sea view and ships outside the window~~ hey... On Seafood Street, Queen’s Road is not far away. Traffic is actually very convenient in Hong Kong. There is a tram at the door of the hotel. You can go to the MTR station or directly to Mong Kok in Central.. Not going out. There is a great potsticker that is delicious and cheap~~recommend! Next time I have a chance, I will consider staying here.! Additional comment July 24, 2008: There is air conditioning! You can adjust the temperature yourself! 
1	"Life is alive, do not change your beliefs because of survival, not be changed by life because of survival, but live to change your life! What the wonderful argument tells the reader is beyond the words themselves. The Italian philosopher Croce said: ""All history is contemporary history."" From the vivid historical events and vivid characters in the book, what we feel is not only the dignity of life and the freedom of thought, but also the inheritance of spiritual culture that changes the self while changing the lifestyle and living conditions. "
0	The superior big bed room did not see a bit of superiority. The mattress spring can be clearly felt. The room does not have a large ceiling light and only relies on two dim bedside lamps to illuminate. It is uncomfortable to put the drinking kettle and tea cup in the bathroom, and the tea stain in the tea cup is not known. I left it one day, and the bath towels were so old that I couldn’t bear to see it. When I checked out the next day, I told me that there were dirt on the three pillowcases and sheets in the room. They returned to the room with the waiter. They opened the curtains of the room. Only seeing the black spots on the pillowcases and sheets made me sick to death. It turned out that we did it. When I checked in at night, there was no overhead light and I couldn’t see the condition of the room. During the day, it was all goose bumps. It was said that we got dirty and we needed compensation. I asked them if you cleaned the room and saw it. They can't answer whether there are any items in the trash I left in the room that can cause such pollution. In the end, although I was not asked to compensate, it was still annoying that we were soiled. Will not choose Hanting to stay in the future. Hotel feedback May 30, 2008: First of all, thank you very much for your stay, and I apologize for the unpleasant experience in our store! Explain: A spring mattress has always been a feature of our Hanting Hotel, and it has been affirmed by many guests, but each guest's needs are different. I hope that guests can understand. The lighting of the room is also specially designed to provide guests with a warm sleeping environment. This need not be explained. As for the three pillowcases and bedsheets reported by the guests, the stains were found to be obvious red fading of the hair. I don't want to explain who is responsible here. Taking into account the customer's psychology, in the case that the courtesy proposal of compensation was unsuccessful, our shop was scrapped. Our aim: service first! I hope guests can make an objective evaluation, and I hope more guests can supervise and guide our store. Thank you! 
1	The point of this book is to subvert many theories of inherent nutrition. What makes me feel the most is the three healthy eating methods she proposed: vegetarian food, raw food, and fasting! Vegetarian food is highly recommended. As for raw food and fasting, it is not so. It can be done easily. Fasting is okay, but raw food is not an easy task for the current life. If it’s not for your own planting! Isn’t time spent on it? How should normal work be arranged? It's a headache!! However, these views of her can be regarded as a reminder to human beings who eat meat now. Because this way, the world will definitely be out of balance. 
0	We live on the 13th floor, but because it is Yanma Road, there are still very noisy noises at night, the soundproofing is not very good, the facilities in the room are very old, it may be due to the age, and it is not as good as home, Motel 168. ...Very poor price/performance ratio 
0	The appearance is conservative; the weight is not light; the camera effect is extremely poor and it is useless; the heat is large, and it must be used with a radiator in summer. 
1	It needs to be discussed professionally. The theoretical basis is a bit weak. You have to read it as a novel, but you can’t stand it. Many problems are scattered, there is no clustering, and the theme is not too obvious. At the end, it seems that the whole book has one purpose: it needs real money. It is real money. Personal subjective feelings: The main problem is that the theme of each chapter is not clear and there is no specificity. In addition, since it is a popular novel, various institutions and characters should have a reasonable introduction, and the result is that suddenly a stick comes out, and sometimes it is not clear. But it's still a book that can be read a second time. 
0	Although the price of the hotel has risen a lot recently, but because it is close to the TV station, I have stayed many times. And the recent practice of the hotel is very infuriating. On July 25th, I went to Shanghai at 3 o’clock in the afternoon. I didn’t notice the time when I was resting in my room at noon. When I went downstairs to check out, it was 1 o’clock. It is settled in 1.5 days. No matter how it is explained, it will not help. What was even more annoying was that the restaurant called me a taxi to the airport after the checkout, and the driver didn't make a meter and asked for 120 yuan to go. Obviously, no more than 80 yuan to the airport. Such hotel service is not as good as 2 stars! ! ! ! ! 
1	Good heat dissipation. The overall workmanship is good. The installation of the system, drivers, and software went smoothly. It ran for a few hours from noon to afternoon. The temperature of the palm rest and keyboard was well controlled, and there was no heat. The screen is very bright and clear, suitable for watching 720p HD video. In addition, an original USB optical mouse is presented in the package, which is a pleasant surprise! 
1	The room is ok, there is a food street downstairs, and the service attitude is very good! But the internet is not very good, it is always disconnected; breakfast is so-so. 
0	1. There is only one indicator light, sometimes there is no way to distinguish the working status of the machine. 2. Dell is relatively stingy. It doesn't even send an inner bag, and it has to be equipped with an inner bag. 
1	The hotel is a bit old, the rooms are relatively small, but the hotel has a good seat, just by the sea, you can go swimming directly. The sea view on the 8th floor opens the window to the sea. If you want to live in a lively area, this is not a good choice, but Weihai is really small and taxis are still quite cheap. There are fewer taxis at the hotel entrance at night. 
0	The disc is found to be cracked and cannot be used. I have contacted Dangdang Customer Service Center to apply for a replacement. It should be sent back to Dangdang Customer Department with the book on the 14th, but there is no news yet, please confirm Dangdang as soon as possible. 
0	The hotel is indeed old, some of the room furniture is out of order, even the bedside lamps are broken, the towels feel dirty, the soundproofing effect of the room is also very poor, the voice of the next room can be heard clearly. The service is average, the attitude is not very good, and the breakfast variety is pitiful. If it weren't for being very close to the airport, there would be no merit. 
0	It is difficult to install the operating system xp. Some drivers have not been found. I wonder if it is because of the poor sound. It is best to install the system and provide enough drivers. 
0	The keyboard feels uncomfortable, it may become natural to use it. Looking at the picture, I think the touchpad is multi-touch, but it is not. Please pay attention. I think the heat dissipation is average, maybe the air outlet is too small. 
1	After reading this book, what I want to know the most is who are my five people? Then I thought about it, I would never guess. Maybe life is like this, we often fail to notice some people or things that play a crucial role in our lives. Or maybe, we complain and be decadent, but always ignore the value of life itself. After reading this book, in my opinion, that is to live every day well. 
1	Small size, long battery life with 6 cores, first-rate workmanship and hand feel, speed is mainly for work and watching movies, which is enough. I haven't tried wireless Internet access yet. My mobile phone has a monthly subscription of GPRS, and I will use Bluetooth ftp to connect. It is estimated to be slow enough. The weight is heavier than the average netbook, but it is acceptable. 
1	The appearance, keyboard, performance and battery are all pretty good, but I just can’t get into the system and I’m depressed. The hard drive is creaking and there is a suspected problem. Although someone upstairs said that the F9 import system can solve the problem, but I didn’t know it during the inspection, and Jingdong’s after-sales service did not mention this method. I exchanged the product directly, or replaced it with a new insurance. 
1	I wanted to buy it for a long time, and finally placed an order with JD.com giving away a lot of things. The front desk MM at the JD headquarters is very smart:) The X200 has a classic appearance, and I like the non-mirror shell, and the CPU performance is very good. 
1	When we were studying in school, the boss used to take us here to play bowling and eating, etc. The environment is good, and the rooms are quite comfortable. It is a relatively high-end hotel in Minhang District. 
1	Stayed there for 2 nights and thought it was pretty good. First of all, the attitude of the receptionist when checking in was very good, especially polite and patient, which made people feel very heartwarming, unlike the waiters in the mainland who ignored them. In addition, the room It is small but very clean. This place in Hong Kong is already very good for a three-star hotel. The location of the hotel is very good, just at the exit of Yau Ma Tei MTR station, the traffic is very convenient, and it is away from Ladies Street and Tong Choi Street is very close. 
0	When can you get through your service phone? The service is too bad. I have been busy from 9 o'clock to 10:34. I bought 10 DVDs from your place, and 5 of them have no sound. I request a replacement. Please contact me in time. 174208675 is my order number. Due to busy work, I have never had time to watch the DVD, and now I found out that most of them are bad. 
1	"The first volume of ""The Teaching of Life"" is the enlightened growth of a human worker. He regards making money more as a tool for social survival. By chance, I experienced the transformation of life and glimpsed my perfection. Although I am still hovering at the level of need to be needed, the moving source of life made me unable to stop the desire to see it again. When I saw Rehasha's persistent exploration of inner existence, I was moved by it. That will also be my way. I also want to be such a consultant. Before that, I have to be myself. "

After taking it home, Dad saw the title of the book and read it ""greedily"", especially remembering ""red bean and barley porridge"". From then on, we will have a bowl of breakfast + dinner. Although there is no special feeling, the many prescriptions in it are simple and easy to implement. . . The pace of real life is very fast, and it seems that it takes too much time to go to the gym and boil weight-loss soup. . There is a book of this kind, which can keep in good health through the subtle and subtle, and it has some self-cultivation effects. . Ha ha "
0	The battery is not durable. Under pure DOS, no program is executed, the screen is closed (the screen is not displayed), and the standby time is less than 1 hour at full power. 
0	The first hard drive and screen are broken and the quality is unstable. I wonder if it is an ASUS problem or a logistics problem? ! 
1	Very good and powerful, super cost-effective! I didn't expect that 3,300 yuan today would be a laptop that satisfies 80% of the game. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! 
0	Summary: I have seen a bad four-star hotel, and have never seen such a bad quasi-four-star hotel. Detailed description: 1. Infrastructure problems: The hotel promises to have broadband Internet access, but the room can be used after replacement. The room facilities are relatively simple. There is a certain gap between the four-shaped standard. The specific manifestation is: old furniture, no necessary office appliances. The bed is not generally hard, and there are obvious stains. 2, The service attitude problem. When arriving at the hotel, the doorman has no sense of service. Not only does not help guests with luggage, but also has no sense of opening the door. The switchboard operator not only does not use bilingual, but also does not even have basic polite language. 3. Security issues: the hotel's fire safety awareness is not high enough. First of all, the hotel room The installation of sockets and power buttons is unstable, and some places are obviously loose. Secondly, carpets are laid in the aisle of the safety exit of the hotel on the 3rd and 4th floors. According to the content of the fire protection law, the aisle of the hotel’s safety exit cannot be laid. The carpet. The security guards are not doing their duty. 4. Food and beverage issues. There is no fruit for breakfast in the hotel. This is something I have never encountered before staying in a hotel. If there is no, there will be no, but the hotel is original and put plastic fruits on the dining table. The hotel is investigating the guest’s IQ or staff errors. The above is the feeling of staying at this hotel, but this hotel is not out of place, there is a light rail at the door of the hotel, the traffic is fairly convenient, it is close to the airport, a receptionist at the front desk and The computer engineer is worthy of praise. If you do not pursue enjoyment, if you can tolerate the days without internet, if you can not make higher demands on the quality of hotel service, if you can guarantee that you will stay in the hotel, there will be no fire in the hotel. I recommend you Check into this hotel. 
0	The location is remote and difficult to find. Taxi drivers don't know about this hotel. There is nothing for the self-service meal in the morning. The dining environment is in a corridor and the environment is relatively poor. A map costs 10 yuan. 
0	The price is more expensive than other brands of computers with the same configuration. It is more difficult to install XP, because the SATA disk chip driver is strange. 
0	When I first bought it, I couldn’t use it for recovery after partitioning. Fortunately, it’s all done now. New users should be provided with a guidance document. Just add a mouse and divide it into two areas. 
1	The waiters are very attentive. The cooperation between Ctrip and the hotel should be very good. Fruits are delivered and 2 pieces of clothes can be washed and ironed for free, and the speed is very fast. The internet speed of the hotel needs to be improved. It is a pity that online games cannot be played. The front desk service is very attentive, praise 
0	"I will never stay in this hotel again, I have never stayed in such a bad hotel before, it is still five-star! ! ! ! ! Metropark was formerly a Hilton Hotel, and it was renamed later. I stayed a few times when it first opened and it felt okay, but then I went to Nanjing and stayed at Golden Eagle (the room rate is similar to Metropark, after all, they are all five-star ), because Golden Eagle is at Xinjiekou, it is convenient to go shopping and eat, but since Nanjing’s Zhongshan East Road is currently under construction, out-of-town cars cannot enter. If you go to Golden Eagle, you will have to detour Zhujiang Road to get there. District, after booking Metropark, you can park the car at the Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway. After this experience, I would rather drive more cars to Golden Eagle in the future. 1. At the time of booking, it was requested to ""make sure to arrange a double room"". Ctrip also responded to the confirmation by SMS, but when I arrived at the front desk, I asked about a twin room. I also asked the front desk that it was not necessary to arrange a double room. ? ! The front desk replied: ""We didn't confirm it like this when we confirmed, and now there is no double bed room."" Forget it, it's important to do business, just move in. I don't bother to talk to her and call Ctrip to ask how it was It's up. 2. In the evening, my friend called to find me. The switchboard said that the guest name in the room was wrong and could not be transferred. My friend thought I had said the wrong room number. He called and asked me. I said the room number was correct. He called again and said The guest's name was wrong and could not be transferred. After four or five calls, the switchboard turned the call! ! ! ! ! ! 3. During the stay, I drank a bottle of Coke and a bottle of Sprite. It was 34.50 when it was carried forward. This is a black shop, but there is no way. People clearly marked the price and wrote it on the paper. I can only blame myself for not having eyesight! ! ! 4. Everything is done, I went to drive home, and arrived at the parking lot (it is open air, just 30 or 40 meters from the hotel entrance), 20 yuan! ! ! Ask the toll collector that the free parking area on the parking ticket has been stamped by the front desk, do you still need to collect money? ! It turns out that you have to pay 20 yuan if you spend the night (the entire side of the parking ticket is densely written on the back of the parking ticket, and the toll collector told me, I didn’t bother to read it), it’s really strange. Live a fart? ! It is not unusual for a five-star hotel to charge for broadband, but it is the first time that I have to pay for accommodation and parking! ! ! ! In short, I will not stay at Metropark again in the future. Golden Eagle, Jinling, Sheraton, and even the four-star Central Hotel are better than Metropark in terms of hardware or service. Supplementary comment on January 24, 2008: The only thing that satisfies me is the doorman at the door. When I went out to eat, he kindly helped me call a taxi and explained to me that it was off work and it was a taxi. Take over, please wait a moment! ! ! Hotel feedback April 14, 2008: Thank you very much for your feedback to our hotel. Regarding hotel parking charges, we will give Ctrip customers special discounts. Customers who book and stay at the hotel can use the hotel parking card to cover the front desk. Take the free parking badge, you can directly enjoy the free parking service. Thank you! "
0	It’s more troublesome to install the system. Fortunately, it was successfully completed with the experience of many netizens. I hope that Jingdong can provide the driver without downloading it ourselves. 
1	The hotel is located in the city center, very convenient. Although I don't have time to see it, I heard that there are many attractions nearby. Generally speaking, the hotel's service is still very good, but the room is relatively small, and it should be a separate small room with two rooms closed. The hardware does not feel that it can reach the 5-star standard. The French restaurant on the third floor is good. 
1	I stayed on June 5-6. The garden view double room in the main building. I am very satisfied with the hotel. The facilities are still new, the room is big enough, the decoration is good, the lobby is magnificent and the service is good. Outside the hotel is Bailuzhou Scenic Area , As soon as you leave the hotel, it is a lake, very comfortable, and the location is good, you can get to Zhongshan Road for 10 yuan, and the buffet breakfast is good. If I go to Xiamen next time, I will stay here again. 
0	The lobby is majestic, but the front desk and rooms are too small, (the corridor is too long) the distribution of the rooms is too scattered, it is very tiring to find a companion. If the hotel can be divided into 2 pavilions and the front desk is also separated, it should be improved. In addition, it has nothing to do with the hotel. The taxi driver in Changchun is too bad, and the enthusiasm on the surface is severely cut. Every time I go on business, I will encounter unpleasantness. After the complaint, there is no further information. This time it was only 6 yuan from the railway station to the provincial hotel, and it took 45 minutes. Too much damage to the image of Changchun! If there are no important business activities in the future, I personally would never go to Changchun again. I hope that the government agencies of Changchun City can carry out rectification as soon as possible!!! 
0	"I have never stayed in such a bad 5-star hotel. The family drove to play. On August 8th, I asked for three view rooms through Ctrip. One of them opened the door and there were guests in it, and the 5-star hotel appeared It’s unheard of that the key card is wrong. After changing rooms, I ate a large piece of plastic paper in the glutinous rice balls in the ""Tingxia"" hall of the hotel after changing rooms. I asked the waiter and agreed to return. After returning to the room, the key card of room 1221 Actually I can't open the door again (you can open it when I first entered). After I called the waiter to open it, the room phone was broken again. Then I called the waiter to repair it. After staying in for just two hours, I encountered 4 unlucky In this special day, the mood of watching the opening ceremony of the Olympics is gone, which is really disappointing. The next morning, I took a good look at the room and found that the bedside lampshade was full of dust, which was very disgusting. A 5 star hotel is really not as good as a 3 star, it's really bad and bad. "
1	The room should exceed 30 square meters, which is one of the few hotels of the same level in HK; after reinstallation, the equipment is also good. 
1	Very nice hotel. I live in Building No. 8. The facilities are quite new, the service attitude is very good, the porter is very attentive, and the breakfast is also quite rich (breakfast is an important criterion for judging the level of the hotel), the details are better, than many listed four stars Better. The location should be pretty good. Will live next time I go. 
0	The 6-cell battery is too heavy. . Although the battery life is long, not all users will need such a long time. You can consider providing a choice of 3 cores and 6 cores 
0	The promotion of Du Lala is unrealistic. That kind of workplace environment is simply utopia, there are, but too few. For most people, the reference is too small. 
0	Because of the disclosure, they are all fake medical scientists, which made me feel very disappointed. I wanted to learn something for my own use. I didn’t expect that after I bought it, I found it was fake and I didn’t want to return it, but I still hope after thinking about it. So unscrupulous authors or publishers do less of these wicked things 
0	I like this book very much, but it makes me sad that I feel comfortable and pirated. The print is fake, I don’t know that Dangdang will sell fake books. 
0	When I opened the package, I was worried that there would be bright spots. The waiter told me that there was a problem with the product and it was useless to refuse to sign. But I don’t know what to do if there are bright spots on the screen at that time? You must ask clearly, I’m lucky doesn’t mean you are all lucky 
1	The quality and workmanship are not very bad. The speaker problems that everyone said have not been carefully tested. Besides, the speakers are inherently a weakness of the notebook, and it is enough to be able to produce sound, without too high requirements. The appearance is more modest, suitable for ordinary people, who want to be the most individual can detour. The battery standby has not been tested. It should be very ordinary. 
0	Too noisy. The service is not good. The room is not soundproof. It's not good anyway. Will not live anymore. . 55555555 
1	The performance is good and the running speed is very fast. The sound is very small. If you only use the Internet, the heat is still very small. 
1	"This set of books is hand-painted, with very cute pen lines and very good paper quality. Each book is thin and tells a story, but it is enough to teach children some good daily habits and make them more confident, polite, and able to express their wishes. This set of potatoes is one of the books that she must read every night before she goes to bed. She never gets tired of reading it, and every time she listens to it with relish, she even tells me in advance: ""Mummy, what will happen to the little bear, the little white rabbit What kind of thing...that's not good, you have to do this..."" This set of books is also recommended for moms with one and a half year old babies. "
0	In a word, I feel much worse than when I lived half a year ago. I lived in a luxury business single room. First of all, the hotel did not receive an order from Ctrip. No one in the housekeeping center), the bed stools are dirty, and the special dishes (such as thousands of packages) introduced to the restaurant are not available. It takes 20 minutes to pay the bill and sign the room. I don't know how the difference is so big! 
0	Seeing the hot reviews on the Internet, I finally couldn’t help but buy it. What is it? It’s completely ostentatious. Honestly speaking, history should be written beautifully, but it doesn’t seem to be like this. Anyway, except for some fresh vocabulary I don’t think it’s good-looking and fun. The thrilling and tortuous war scenes described by him are not reflected through conflicts, but rigid, rigid, and defined. In short, it is not good-looking, not level, and meaningless. 
0	I have studied Chinese medicine for five years. The original intention of the patient may be good, but many prescriptions are wrong in the content, such as Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. Why are so many people watching? 
1	"My son, who is almost 8 years old, loves history. I chose this book ""Exploring the Qing Dynasty"" from the series of ""Primary Students Reading History One Step Ahead"". The son liked it so much that he couldn't put it down! Let me talk about my feelings. The book is printed well, but the book is not suitable for carrying. The font in the book is very large, which is very suitable for children to read. Some pictures are interspersed to make history books less boring. The content is also quite rich, especially suitable for lower grade children to read. So, I bought the remaining 9 books and gave them to my son as a Children's Day gift. I believe he will like it! "
1	For those who love philosophy and history, this book is worth reading, although the writing is a bit scattered, because it is an analysis of the lives and thoughts of the three characters under that special historical background. After reading it, you will discover the intricate interplay between history, destiny and freedom. However, it can also be said that if there is no destiny, there is no freedom. What choice do you make in the face of fate? And where does fate come from? This is a question that everyone should reflect on. 
1	The service attitude is very good. Although something unpleasant happened after the check-in, due to the timely and unexpected handling of the lobby manager, this stay has a particularly good memory, and I will choose the St. Regis Red Tower in the future. of. 
1	The appearance is good, the battery life is strong, the keyboard is obviously better than other machines, and the display is clear 
0	The fan sounds very loud (especially unimaginable when it is turned on and reinstalled); it is troublesome to change windows in a Linux system; it takes a lot of effort. 
1	The Chinese nation has a long history and agrees with the view that learning idioms is a good way to learn ancient culture. There are literature, history, military and philosophy in idioms. What children like is stories and plots. Through comparative learning, not only allows children to listen to the stories, but also allows them to firmly grasp some idioms. When I was young, I liked those people who spoke well and had idioms on their lips. When I grow up, I start to learn by myself or from others. Not only I want to learn, but when the child grows up, I also let him learn. 
1	I think this book is worthy of taste. Through reading, first of all, we can avoid these mistakes in our future work; second, we can easily see through these tricks; finally, we should pay special attention to professional ethics. In this field, we must at least maintain our own purity, and never use our expertise to lie or do some negative things. The development of statistics in China is so slow that a large number of principled professionals are needed. My belief is to start from myself and contribute my meager strength to the statistical cause of the motherland. 
1	The lobby of the hotel is very nice, and the rooms are very nice, warm and comfortable. It is a nice five-star hotel. 
1	It can be used for an hour and a half in a low battery state. This machine is too strong and looks very good. It is worth 2899 to catch up with the promotion. 
1	Very cost-effective~~~ The graphics card is 3430. Not bad~~~~~ Install a carrot garden ghost version and all drivers are available~~~ Very convenient~~~ Much more convenient than HP~~~ 
1	I fancy it the night before, but I didn't expect so many things to be given away at the event the next day! This one is selected from more than 30 models, I really like it 
0	I bought it after reading the predecessor’s evaluation, but after reading it, I didn’t think it was as good. After I read the contents, I felt like talking to others mixed with English words. In Chinese, the scattered English words make me feel bad. I don't think it will help me much. Just a personal opinion. 
1	"1. Take a taxi to the hotel and leave, and send the card for registering the taxi number. If there are missing items, it is easy to find; 2. The front desk service is fast; 3. I had two dinners in the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor. The taste is very good and the service First-class, take the initiative to guide the seat to facilitate watching TV, convenient to watch the Olympics, breakfast has a unique snack area in Xiamen, regardless of dinner or breakfast, the waiter will be sent to the elevator after the meal; 4. Because the flight is late, I have a try , To reflect, I extended the check-out for free for 2 hours, I was very touched; 5. It took a short time to do the questionnaire survey and gave gifts and surprises; 6. After hanging up ""Do not disturb"", the waiter quietly handed out the card to remind Room cleaning can be done at any time, very good; 7. The location is convenient, to ferry, South Putuo, Xiamen University, etc., 2 yuan air-conditioned bus to get it, cooler and more spacious than taxis; there are many, not to mention one by one. When I went to Xiamen, I didn't live in Xiamen Hotel 10 years ago. I stayed this time and I will live here in Xiamen later! "
0	Your company sent it on the 14th, why haven’t you received it today? Today is the 26th. It has been 12 days and I haven't received the book yet. 
1	"The previous book was titled ""From Middle School Student to Actress"". It was a book that left youthful memories, both for authors and readers. Some chapters were very happy when I read them before, but I shed tears when I read them again. The author's beautiful and straightforward writing style is still warm and refreshing people's mind after twenty years. Take a closer look, how do people deal with difficulties, temptations, criticisms, and denials when they are young? Freedom, individuality, growth and integration into the world, everything has answers, but it is not only in middle age that the author is in a group of plain and relaxed The reason stated in the sentence? "
1	"At that time, I bought a book worth several hundred yuan in Dangdang at one time. Unexpectedly, my son took out this book with a unique packaging from a large pile of books. He tore open the CD package with his teeth and put it in the CD player. Inside, lie down on the bed. . . . . When the machine reads ""DAVE"", he also reads ""DAVE"". . . . . . When I open the book, the English characters in the book are very big, and the pictures are also very beautiful. When I get the book, I talk with pictures in every lesson. I tell a story with my son before letting him listen to English. Whether he can understand or not, Attracting his attention is considered a success. . . . "
0	If the requirements are higher, don't live here. --The economy room is very small, the bed is hard, and there is noise from the boiler at night. The standard room is larger, but the walls are old, the carpet is mottled, and the bathroom is simple. After the shower, the water flows everywhere and the next person can directly wash the basin. The front desk was irresponsible and did not reserve the reserved room. After Ctrip negotiated with it, it reluctantly changed the room. The overall attitude is cold. The external environment of the room is good, but the question is, if you come to travel, how much time do you have to enjoy its Uganda fragrance? Additional comments August 1, 2008: There is a long way to go by taxi from the hotel, and the traffic is not too convenient. 
1	The function is edible, and the touch keys are set reasonably. The configuration and price are cost-effective. The keyboard feels pretty good, and the camera above the notebook is also very edible. The overall feeling is very good, it is recommended not to buy large games and influence editors. The system went online and watched the film quite well, it may be optimized. The operating system is VS, you can change to XP if you are not used to it. After all, the current system disk is very advanced. 
1	"People can fail, but they cannot be defeated. The outer body can accept torture, but the inner will is sacred and inviolable. This is the argument that ""The Old Man and the Sea"" has repeatedly emphasized. Real masters use the simplest language to express the deepest truths. Really good works use life experience as the subject matter. The Old Man and the Sea portrays the best portrait of Hemingway in his life. Hemingway said, ""I have read it more than 200 times, and every time I read it, I gain a bit more, as if I finally got what I wanted from the hard work of my life?"" "
0	Why does it sometimes get stuck when playing Warcraft? After the popular butterfly sword is not displayed directly, or even a black screen. 512 graphics card is so rubbish? 
0	With vista with 2G memory, the speed is still a bit unable to keep up, but it is still acceptable, and other problems have not been found for the time being. . . 
0	Installing the XP system is super, super troublesome, and two people did it in the afternoon and evening. It would be super easy if there is no LINUX system, I am half dead because of the LINUX system. . 
0	"I have also been watching ""Dulala's Promotion"" during my travel these days. It is indeed a recommended workplace reading. Although they are virtual, many skills can be used in real life. They are not fully used, but they can also be used for reference. After reading it, I found it more useful. "
1	The machine is very light and the screen works well. My screen is not broken or bright. The machine itself comes with VISTA 
1	Apple's design is very user-friendly and pays attention to user experience. Even if it is a newbie, it is still very interesting to use. 
0	1. The driver is not easy to install. 2. The express company is super bad. 3. The price will be reduced before the goods are delivered. The customer service said that the goods cannot be insured when they are out of the warehouse. The insured value can be applied for when the goods are paid on delivery. 
1	I’ve always liked it, but this time I have a few questions: First, the waiter at the hotel’s entrance was too indifferent and it was useless. It rained the morning when I arrived at the hotel and there were a lot of things. They actually stood there when I took a taxi. I didn't move, not even reaching for the door. If you want a tip, I think someone will definitely give it to you. Suggest improvements, at least you can help the guests take things. Second, the hotel reception was not notified in time. When I checked in that day, I said that I was staying for two nights, but the front desk staff only asked me to press a deposit of 500 yuan, and then did not notify me. I returned to the hotel the next day and found that the door could not be opened. I called and asked before telling me that the deposit was not enough. Obviously, the service is not humane at all and I hope it can be improved. In addition, the hotel’s luggage storage service is very good, and the environment is also very good. Generally speaking, it is ideal. I hope to improve the above two problems and do better, so that guests will like your hotel more. Looking forward to your improvement and reply.

1	This is a very prosperous set of books that are very popular with children. Because of the broadcast of the TV series and movies of the same name, the books have become very popular, and children have always liked them very much. From stickers to books, to TV series and even stuffed toys, you have to take care of yourself. Indeed, this book is also beautiful in pictures, realistic in patterns, humorous in dialogue, and unique. Sometimes I will look through it when I am free to give myself a little relaxation. The only drawback is that it is too long, and waiting is also a painful thing~~ 
1	Very nice hotel in Dalian, but it almost made a mistake with Nanshan Garden 0.0 
0	The characters are a bit small, the white part of the keyboard is not as good as the black screen. The touch keys are too smart and accidentally touched, the heat dissipation is average, and the best product is hot after four hours of playing. -! 
0	Originally, psychology is a category that I am very interested in. At first reading Bi Shumin's several books were not bad, I bought two books. I finally finished reading it, and I found it particularly boring. It was unsuccessful to think about suspense, to literacy was unsuccessful, and to tell a story was uninteresting. No gain, so disappointed! ! ! 
1	3788 started, good luck. The appearance is good-looking, the workmanship is very solid, the screen is gorgeous, the sound quality of the stereo speakers is super good, the whole machine generates low heat, and the sound is low during operation. 
1	I was attracted to this book after only reading two articles. The author is very talented and writes his true feelings. It can be said that the writing is clear, the language is fluent, the true feelings are expressed, and the writing is also beautiful. Following in the author's footsteps, we have been heading south, the fragrance of the grass and trees is pungent, the flowers are blooming, they are a different kind of fiery red, walking into the depths of the grass and trees of the southern country, the stream is clear, the fruit is full, and a strange piece is cut open. The fruit, sweet and pervasive, is intoxicating, and makes people salivate. The author, let us have a taste of countless exotic flowers and fruits, grow our horizons, grow knowledge, and satisfy our curiosity. Good book, I recommend. 
0	XP installation is more troublesome, the key is to find an XP installation disk with ICH9. After installing according to the method on the Internet, no sound card problem was found. 
0	Very general, not as good as expected, the content is a bit superficial, nothing special, especially the part about the health preservation of Chinese medicine, a little disappointed, but the quality of the layout is still OK, the text size looks very comfortable, nothing more! 
1	Overall it's not bad, the transportation service is okay, the hotel is a bit old, it doesn't look like a four-star grade, the lobby is very old, hehe, the price is reasonable. 
1	I like Ming Xiaoxi's book before, I haven't bought it before, only this one! The quality of the book is pretty good, but it's basically all serialized. I can't help it. I just read a few short stories behind it, and it feels average! If you want to finish reading these serials, it is estimated that you will have to buy a lot of books, so I lose interest at once, because I am reading the smallest talk! And in these two magazines, at least it is unshakable, so if you don't plan to buy it anymore, let it stay! But I’m sure about this book. If there are friends who like Ming Xiaoxi, let’s support it. 1 It’s really a feature of Ming Xiaoxi! 
1	I watched the news today. A star died of cancer, and a singer, Asan. Alas, it’s really not easy to live a healthy life in the current society. I bought this book by Mr. Jiang and felt very profitable. Starting from food, looking for health is the most fundamental. Moreover, he has done a public welfare undertaking-environmental protection, and he has also reached a healthy state, having the best of both worlds. If you can’t stick to a vegetarian diet for a long time, I think it’s good to eat it occasionally or in combination. As long as you can help yourself healthily, I believe you will not fail to do it. A good book, take a look. it works. 
1	I always think that ACER is synonymous with high cost performance. The notebook is good, the screen is perfect, the 300,000-pixel camera is still very clear, the system is also easy to install, at least I think it is much easier to install than HP's notebook, and it is worth buying. 
0	The appearance is a bit ugly, probably because of the mold, and the plastic shell feels very low-grade, it should be unsightly in design 
1	This book really and delicately reflects the mental journey and experience of the young girl after suffering from leukemia. I sighed how the author could write this book in the voice of a teenage girl in his 40s. Although this place is full of fears of death and complaints about God, I see more of the glory of human nature, no matter what it expresses. Seeing that Tessa finally died so peacefully, I realized that the terrible thing is not death, but the terrible thing is that there are still many unfulfilled wishes for the sake of dying. This is a book worth reading. Cherish the present, cherish life. 
0	The notebook has a large amount of heat and is heavier. If it is lighter, it will be fine. Then when the things are received, they will be worn to death in order to install the XP system. 
0	"The guest room environment is poor. You can often see ""Xiaoqiang"" in the room. The newly laid sheets are marked by 2/3 of the entire area, and there are 3 or 4 black shoe prints. It is disgusting. pole. All the water in the bathroom is very slow. I have to listen to it for a short time every 5 or 6 minutes when I take a shower in the bathtub. Otherwise, it will flood the Seven Army and the towels are gray, which is really bad. Please consider carefully if you want to stay in Germany. "
0	Without the driver and system installation CD, it will bring some inconvenience to future use. The most annoying thing is that the entire hard disk has only one partition. The manufacturer's approach is too lazy and irresponsible! 
1	The overall performance is good, the appearance is also good, and it can be installed smoothly with a GHOST XP disk. The key is that it is rare to match the INTEL PM45 chipset, which is much better than SiS. 
0	The comments are so hot, I thought it was a good book, but the result can be said to be a free book, with no content, empty, general...a hundred spent my money! You can’t read this kind of book if you want to learn about Chinese medicine Nothing written! 
0	The facilities of the hotel seem to be relatively old, and there is no central control in the room, which is very inconvenient. The hot water is not bad. The front desk attitude is average. 
1	The room is clean, there are water purification devices, and bathrobes. The free breakfast was also gone. Good value for money. The only downside is that the checkout time at the front desk is relatively long! 
1	Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters
0	Why can’t I find the acupuncture points? I always feel that the book is a bit bragging, especially the preface that scares people like a master in martial arts. 
0	Standard double room, small area. Broadband is 20 yuan per day (other chain stores are generally free). There are only thin sheets on the mattress, which makes it feel very dirty. The waiters are generally very old, and the old churros service is poor. Walking. It takes about 5 minutes to Century Park Station. If you visit the Shanghai New Exhibition Center and stay in the store, the price-performance ratio is just passing. 
0	There was a lot of thunder and rain, and I wanted to buy some good books for my children. I found this book was well evaluated, but it turned out to be rubbish, which is not the case at all. It is absolutely worthless for 6 cents a page! 
0	Wasting my time. First, the selected subject matter is not practical. Second, the vocabulary should be unprofessional, while the popular ones pretend to be deep. I feel that the current foreign language education in China is just a few foreigners who have become experts in a few packages, which is much worse than the business English textbooks used in college. 
0	The book is still new and can't be read. The protagonist is a woman, the working environment is a multinational company, there is no resonance~ I really can't stand it~ Maybe it's a good book~ Maybe it's too popular~ I don't like it~ 
0	1. The battery standby time is only two hours. 2. The system LINUX is too bad. 3. After reinstalling XP, the relevant installation software is not easy to find on the HP website, and it is not very right to install it according to the online instructions. It took nearly four hours to do it. 
0	This sister is almost obsessed with this book. I don't like this bite, I have no patience to watch it. Simply praise the efficiency and quality of this book delivery. At least the quality of the book is good, better than my first two purchases. Hope to keep it in the future. 
1	Very ordinary hotel, because I can't book Gandian, reluctantly check in 
0	The book is full of truths, which may be known in daily life, but there are very few practical implementations. The book just made some generalizations and summaries, and there is no new idea. I only turned over the whole book for 1 minute. 
0	The place is really partial, even the taxi driver has been looking for N for a long time. The room is very big. The facilities inside are outdated. As soon as I live in, there are harassment calls and tracking. It is really strong!

0	The processor configuration is not high, it can be better if it can be higher; the hard disk partition is unreasonable, and there is only one area, and you have to partition the software yourself, which is troublesome; the screen is a bit large, the computer is a bit heavy, and the girls have to carry it hard 
0	When installing the system, long press F2 to enter the main version. This prompt is not displayed on the machine. I found it on the Internet. There are several default hard disk partitions, and one of them is displayed as bos. It was only later that I wanted to delete all partitions. Download, reformat, and read the xp installed, otherwise it will not be displayed. 
0	It is one of the few books that I regret buying. It is too expensive and the content is not as good as others commented. It depends on whether the child likes it 
0	It’s a bit hot, and you must install power4 gear. Normally, the cpu reaches 56 degrees or more in standby mode, and a shortcut button collapses halfway. When entering the BIOS setting, the hand close to the left microphone hole will make a loud whistling sound, which is very strange. 
1	I haven't finished reading it yet, but the author is indeed a very interesting woman, ha ha, so even if she is in her 30s and divorced, so what! No one wants to be unhappy and happy; there are also a few around me A crazy woman, including myself, although the kind of conversation with myself or talking to a certain object often happens, but holding a kitchen knife to persuade myself, standing on one foot when crying, and similar things have never been tried Haha...Sometimes, it's amazing to hear your inner voice... 
1	The graphics card has a large video memory, other things are average, and the screen is okay. I tried to play Grand Theft Auto 4 and the picture is not bad. I am downloading Need for Speed 12, and then see how the test results are. 
0	The battery life does not seem to reach the advertised 9.5 hours, which is slightly larger and heavier than the Lenovo S10. 
1	When I first read this book, I feel very relaxed. Lan Xin and Xiao Zhu are a pair of invincible and lovely partners. Although each has the burden of family and country, there is no lack of exaggeration and humor in dealing with people. It is always difficult to pair up. Right guy. Especially the looks like a strong female match, but it also sets off the pig’s generosity and elegance. The second half begins to enter the persistent plot melody. It seems that I am sweating, but the ending of Yinghuo is actually It's a little sad...He is really a distressed fortune teacher. . . 
0	Near the touchpad is hotter, obviously not as good as the Lenovo K41A, which is just a bit warmer 
1	I like Wu Xiaobo's words, and with the calmness of a news person, he darns these history together like a needle and thread. Looking at this book, my mind is full of turmoil for thirty years. Success is also a hero, and failure is also a great person. In the 10 cases, without exception, they are full of the breath of adventurers and the boldness to be the first. It is what others dare not do. They succeeded, but because of various reasons (the original impulse to expand) Falling down quickly makes people sigh. This is a legendary age, and it is impossible to comment on its color, only know that the color is extremely gorgeous, the moment before it disappeared. 
0	The battery is a bit short, it can only be used for an hour and a half, the workmanship is relatively rough, but think about the money, it can not be too high. There is also the fact that Jingdong delivery is too slow~~~~~~ After the package was packed and placed in those 4 days, it was shipped to me. As a result, it took 9 days from the order to the receipt! 
1	The white piano paint is very beautiful and the sound effect is great. For surfing the Internet, doing some text office, watching movies, as long as it is not a super blockbuster, the key is the convenience. The battery used 5 and a half hours in continuous office work. 
1	The price-performance ratio is very good, and everyone has said the advantages, so I won't repeat them. If you want to use XP, you must use SP3, all the drivers are covered, no need to search online (some minor incompatibilities may appear) 
0	The four-star hotel in Pingyao is actually only two and a half stars. The service of the state-run guest house 20 years ago was very poor. Probably because of the lack of occupants, the rooms are closed for a long time, the rooms in the west wing of the hotel have a musty smell, and the toilet still smells bad. It is recommended to insist on a room in the east wing of the hotel. -The hotel does not accept credit cards, only cash. Guests cannot sign orders for consumption in the restaurant and must pay in cash. -The shampoo/bath lotion provided by the hotel is of poor quality. The toilet paper is stained with mildew. It is highly recommended to bring your own shampoo and toilet paper to avoid accidents. -The hotel’s bedding is “one-for-one-change”, and the guest stays in the shop without changing the sheets. -Breakfast is very poor, basically vegetarian. -The baggage student recommends the chartered service to slaughter customers crazy. A half-day chartered car (Xia Li) to the Wang's Compound actually asked for 400 yuan back and forth. I went out and stopped the street for only 200 yuan (30 yuan for the high-speed toll for the round trip), or Santana 2000. But it is said that other hotels in Pingyao are more terrible. Planning to live in Pingyao, Lize Court is a helpless choice. 
1	Powerful performance, beautiful appearance, special NBA Collector's Edition. In fact, heat dissipation is still possible, better than the IBM I used before, the perfect screen LG. 
1	Originally wanted to buy HP! It was about 3500! But it can be cheaper by 300! 2955! It is worth it~ It is also a two-year warranty! The screen is large enough~ The keyboard is also quite comfortable~ Basically some dongdongs are available~ It is just suitable for the elderly home ! 
1	The overall feeling is good, the introduction is relatively comprehensive, many things are not learned in other books, but unfortunately it is in English. The system concept of Chinese typesetting has not yet been formed in China, at least books about the system of Chinese typesetting. Not many, even if there are introductions, they are also very superficial. I have searched n many books on Chinese character layout and bought several books on Chinese character layout, but I was disappointed, not very good. I hope that China will do more in this area in the future. Learn from advanced countries and improve a theoretical system of Chinese typesetting. 
1	As an old hotel, I feel that the environment and services are in place. It is very close to the subway and it is very convenient to go out. But according to the price-performance ratio of a five-star hotel, Nanjing people say this is not very cost-effective. I feel good living by myself. I booked a room with a city view, the bed was big and soft, and the corner room was specially requested, very quiet. The interior design inside is also generous and comfortable. The design of the TV on the wall is not very good, so I can't bear it when I lie on the bed and twist my neck for a while. I tried the food downstairs, and the taste was okay, but it was too expensive and the breakfast was too expensive. A card is required for the elevator, which is very inconvenient for visiting friends. The air conditioner is adequate. 
1	I recently had a question that I couldn’t figure out, so I wrote it to everyone to discuss: If you dream back to Xiaowei in the Qing Dynasty, Ruoxi in the startling heart, A Li in Do Not Forget, Ling Er in the worldly jail, and let the snow and ice become hot Chenfang in the middle, Ruohan in your next life, and the dream back to Daqing. Yaohua in the Yaohua, Wanran in the dream, Qiu Ji, etc., etc., if you wear them at the same time , Then what kind of story will happen, I don't know who can write it? 
0	5.1. ---5. 3. I have never dared to take a shower in the room. Too cold. The room is too old. The facilities are too poor. Bottled water is provided in the room 
0	First, the sis motherboard does not support dual channels. It only supports 667 memory and 800 for frequency reduction. I even bought a 2g Kingston ddr2 800 memory. The blue screen often appears. I will try to change to a modern one tomorrow. 
1	The environment is very good, the service is very good, the traffic is inconvenient, and the price is a bit expensive 
1	Fast delivery; good workmanship; good heat dissipation after a few days; dual graphics card switching may save power 
1	The configuration is relatively balanced, especially the graphics card uses GDDR3 memory, and the performance has been improved; the appearance is beautiful, the keyboard feels good; the brightness and color of the LED screen are excellent; the included memory and mouse are very practical, equivalent to a certain Degree of discount... 
1	This book can be completely based on reality. For the errors and improprieties of Chinese-English translation in life, first comment and then compare with foreign public signs. It is a good mentor and helpful friend for translators and a rare good book. . It has played a very important role in regulating public announcements in our country and avoiding the occurrence of jokes. It also provides a rare reference book for relevant people. The disadvantage is: there are some details, the words and sentences on the photo are not clear, if you can write it under the photo again! 
1	"This is one of Xiaoxiao's favorite picture books. I guess there are two reasons: one is a story about friendship, children need partners most, so such stories can resonate. For example, Xiaoxiao calls herself ""Xiao Lan"" and her little friend Xiao Bao ""Xiao Huang"". The protagonist in the two books is actually color, which is also a familiar phenomenon in the life of babies. It is really creative to regard color as a person. The fusion of colors is like people’s embrace. It is really too interesting for children. Up. Moreover, the understanding of colors has deepened, which is great! "
0	I have bought the book for a long time, but I have never read it. I occasionally read a paragraph and find that I have no perseverance to read it. It may be that I still have a certain understanding of Ming history. I cannot agree with the author’s use of networked and popular language. Interpretation of Ming History. Especially this morning I saw CCTV's interview with Mingyue that year. I think the host has reservations about this. 
0	Sometimes it crashes. I don’t know if it’s a system problem or a machine problem. It’s still under close observation... 
0	Why is the quality of the book so bad! ! ! The cover is very thin and the cut inside is not neat at all. Is it pirated? ! ! ! ! 
1	After reading your comments, I booked a deluxe room through Ctrip. As everyone commented, the decoration and furnishings of the rooms are western, clean and comfortable. Hotel service is still very good. The front desk MM is not as beautiful as in the legend, maybe they didn't work when I went. But the waitress at the front desk is still very handsome. The fly in the ointment is that the big bed room I want is only facing the street. The windows of the room are not soundproof. At night, I fell asleep at one or two o'clock in the middle of the night because of the noise of cars outside the window. In addition, the 3rd and 5th floors are still being renovated, the 3rd floor is okay, and the 5th floor paint smells very strong. It is recommended to check the room location and renovation progress with the hotel phone before booking. 
1	I got it yesterday. After a long time I installed all the protection software and made a GHOST backup. The running program is okay and acceptable. The appearance, the keyboard is very stylish. The standby time is higher than similar products. I heard that Asus's battery is still good. 
0	After using it for 2 weeks, I think it’s too heavy to bring it. 3 kg is a solid weight. The screen is LCD, it’s very tiring to watch too much 
0	The facilities are outdated and small! The lights are dim! Breakfast is ok! Additional comment June 5, 2008: In addition, the gym is gone for a long time, I hope Ctrip information should be updated in time 
1	Beautiful appearance, the biggest selling point. The keyboard is big, the reason why Lenovo S10 was eliminated. The battery is good. 
1	After using it for a few days, the system crashed. I went to Tongfang to check and found 30% bad sectors. They have been returned for replacement. I don’t know how to get them. 
1	I won’t talk about it. It’s a very good value machine. I’ve been staring for more than half a year. I will place an order as soon as the price drops. 
1	It looks super cool, it's very easy to use, its performance is super good, 256 is unique, and 3DA is more than wrong. Good notebook, ASUS is the most worthy notebook at this price, highly recommended 
1	I love to play games, the graphics card is absolutely cool, the cpu is enough, and the look is pretty good, the temperature of this machine is still acceptable 
1	It is very clear, unlike some people who say it is pirated, I like it very much! The supporting listening materials are downloaded from the Internet, the content is very rich, the scene is all-encompassing, there are different English speakers' voice and intonation, which makes me feel interested to listen. For English learners, the accent listening materials in this book can help you become familiar. The book is the written material of all the recordings and is available for reference on hand. Although after so many years, I think the listening materials are out of date, what is needed is to listen persistently! 
1	Special offer for staying in a suite during the Spring Festival, including breakfast/dinner, the service is very good, but the hotel is a bit old, but the facilities are not bad! It's just that this Spring Festival price point hopes that the hotel can realize the normalization of the Spring Festival special weekend, which will attract most tourists! 
1	The room is very clean! The breakfast is great! The doorman is great! This is the second time I booked it. Will live in the future. 
1	I did not encounter the trouble of installing the driver mentioned above, everything went well, as long as the advanced BOIS changed the hard disk reading method to IDE, XP can be installed. 
1	The history of the Ming Dynasty is basically blank. Because of a joke in the office, I started to touch this book. The more I read it, the more I liked it. The rise and fall of dynasty after dynasty emerged in front of me. Loyal ministers, traitorous ministers, people who had the courage to take responsibility , There are so many people worthy of our admiration, maybe no name or surname, there are so many people worthy of us to learn, to be an upright person. 
0	Performance is average The power cord is too thick, a bit unsuitable compared to the body. The price is a bit expensive, but Samsung’s Dongdong has always been more expensive than others 
0	Reinstall XP, but some functions can’t be realized. It’s fine if you directly use the XP system; the machine looks small, but the weight is a bit heavy; the heat dissipation is still slightly hot; the standalone display is still weak, but the 130M machine is more expensive a lot of 
1	not bad. In fact, there is no right or wrong in life. Right or wrong may be a criterion for others to comment on the event, but for the person involved, this process is not a process of your hard life and struggle. If this process is enjoyable for you, it is also worth it. That's it. Therefore, life effort is very important. You have worked hard. It may be unscrupulous in others' eyes, but as long as you don't hurt others or violate the first bottom line you recognize, then do it. What's more, many times in life, only admit this truth: the winner is the king, and the loser is the bandit. 
1	It is very convenient because it is very close to the customer. To be honest, the room has not paid much attention, because only the morning is more awake during the day, and the rest is drunk. The breakfast was good and the room was clean. It's a pity that I stayed for two and a half days in a hurry and didn't go to see the largest surf swimming pool in the city. 
0	I lived in room No. 6, without windows, like living in a basement; and because of this, the hotel is located in a prosperous area and has a lot of business operations. The people I met in the elevator were very mixed! Overall the accommodation environment is very uncomfortable! I didn’t get any discount on the room rate when I booked it on Ctrip. It’s the same price if I didn’t make a reservation. But it is recommended that everyone must ask clearly. Own requirements. Don't regret it! 
1	This is the second set I bought and gave it to my nephew. The story is very interesting, the language is lively and lively, the baby listens to it over and over again. Some of the hidden knowledge points in the story are not even known to me, but they are all things that babies are particularly curious about. The baby pestered me to talk every day. After the talk, he would test me with the next game. Sometimes, I pretended not to know, or deliberately said something wrong, and he just laughed. 
1	The first time I saw this book was in the Bookstore. I read the first section and felt it gave me a lot of strength. This is the best book I have ever seen to develop potential. I am going to read it according to the book's arrangement. It is difficult to read and requires a certain amount of life experience and understanding. But reading the classics, isn't it? I thought it would be a book that I have read all my life, so I bought it. But if one day I can apply the magic, I can stop reading this book when I am single-minded. Because it has become a part of me and become my little universe. I believe it will. 
1	The hotel is located in the western ring road, but the transportation is convenient. The tram station is not far from the door. You can take the whole journey for 2 yuan, but the speed is a bit slower and there are many stations. But because of the location, eating nearby is relatively cheap, and 15-30 yuan is enough for a tea restaurant. The room facilities are average, but the area is large in HK. After all, it is only 390 Hong Kong dollars, which is only more than 350 when converted into RMB. For leisure travel, consider staying here. 
1	Friends stayed in the previous stage. It feels good, and I have a high evaluation of the environment of this city. 
1	The facilities are good, the location is good, but the level of service staff is almost the same. Check out in the morning is too slow, waiting for forty minutes. A Beijing guy and a group of Shanghai people scolded at the front desk because of the check-out line, and the service staff did not dare to come forward to mediate. Next time I live at Intercontinental or Hilton. 
0	The memory is too small, so I can only modify the XP system. It took me several days. Fortunately, I got it now. All the hardware and function keys are in normal use. The shortcoming is that under the XP system, the integrated graphics and discrete graphics cannot The conversion can only be set in the BIOS, and the conversion is performed after rebooting. 
0	The language is empty, the plot is too outrageous, and I don’t feel shocked. I just feel that this person is too unlucky, and there is nothing to explore. I think the wonderful part of the whole book may be the preface. 
0	1. There is a problem with the printing of this book. There are a few pages of printing, which can not be shown to children at all, and it will hurt the children’s eyes. 2. The content is not very good. It is very difficult to tell children. The vocabulary book I will read is very impractical. In short, this book is not good. I suggest that you don’t read the recommendations and read more reviews. This is true 
1	Small, light, and reasonable configuration, different from ordinary netbooks with a six-cell battery, it can be used as fast as 6 hours, very good 
1	Seaview Garden is the best service of all the 5-star hotels I have stayed in. Besides, their Cantonese restaurant is very authentic and the price is reasonable. If you go to Qingdao, I will choose it again. Fantastic 5 star hotel, good location and environment, with best service and very nice staff, strongly recommend. The Cantonese restaurant is one of the best, worth to try!!! Additional review July 29, 2008: &#32431;& #20013;&#26041;&#31649;&#29702;&#65292;&#38750;&#24120;&#26834;&#65281; 
0	The battery can only be used for 5 hours! The camera is basically unusable at night, it is too dark! Unless there is a headlight shining on yourself, it is bad. 
1	"This is a book that our whole family loves to read. We call it ""find baby"". The baby is 3 years old. I love ""finding baby"" with her father. Sometimes, the little guy will find it by himself quietly. Baby, the duration can be more than half an hour. The book is colorful and well-conceived. Any baby that the baby finds can clearly remember the specific location. Sometimes the baby will make up stories based on the overall picture, so that her imagination can be more released. I also love this set of books. It is a complete relaxation when looking at it. "
1	The hotel is an older four-star hotel with outdated facilities, small rooms, and a bad health scale. The overall feeling is average, but the price is still based on the new four-star, so it feels not very worthwhile. 
1	The location is OK, there are some big food stalls near the West Lake, and eating is more convenient. The hotel service is very good, the waiter and the front desk staff are very friendly, the room is big and clean, the price is high, if you go to the West Lake next time you will stay. 
1	I bought this book as a gift to my mother, and the old man said it was very good. First, the cover color of the book is soft and warm, making people want to read the content after reading it. Second, the pictures and texts are detailed, easy to look at, follow along, and learn to relax. Third, the content of the book is arranged reasonably. My mother said that the book first introduces what Gua Sha is and its health-care functions, and then teaches some basic Gu Sha techniques, and then how to use Gu Sha to check the health of various parts of the body. Finally, it is based on the difference. Different methods of scraping are used for the disease of the part. I probably looked through it myself, and it was good, not many words and pictures. 
1	High cost performance, generous machine workmanship, alloy hand plate, easy to find drivers, but the system is difficult to install. 
0	The first day I booked a standard room (big bed) room, the result was that the big bed was not big, it was too crowded for two people and the room was too small. The most intolerable thing is that the toilet is actually together with the shower, which is very wet and inconvenient. The next day, I changed to a standard twin room. The room was much more spacious. What I didn't expect was the singing in the karaoke hall downstairs, and I couldn't sleep at 12 o'clock. Who would dare to stay in such a hotel? 
0	I regret buying a set. The description looks like a running account. There are no highlights. If you want to watch it, you can just watch it online. Collection is simply unnecessary. 
0	In the alley, but it's pretty easy to find. The room rates are cheap, the hotel facilities are simple, but relatively clean. It is very close to the Beijing Railway Station and can be reached on foot. There is a snack bar at the entrance of the alley. If you are close to the train station, you can choose this. Additional review April 21, 2008: The previous review was wrong because of the wrong hotel name. This hotel in Beijing Oriental Peace Hotel feels bad to me. Although the location is good, it is close to Wangfujing Street, but the check-out speed is slow, the rooms are not soundproofed, smelly, and look unclean. Will not go next time. 
1	It's the only hotel where you can stay in Ningxia. I live here every time. 
1	As a five-star hotel, all facilities are outdated, and the room size obviously does not reach the five-star standard. The speed of hotel check in is extremely slow. Arrived around 11pm and waited 15 minutes. The room rate is too expensive, except for the location factor, it is not up to the level of a five-star hotel. Breakfast is okay at the price of ctrip. The bathroom in the room is good, the water pressure is high, and the water temperature is comfortable, and it is also very large and not cramped. It is suggested that you can consider Yuehai which is not far away. 
1	I just bought 4799 on April 20th, which is yesterday, but I don’t think it is exquisite enough. If a friend wants it, 4700 will be transferred. The invoice, accessories and packaging are all available. Haha, contact 13501907120 
1	Everyone knows the simple truth. However, after reading this book, I realized that human life experience is not that simple. The author Diamond uses the sharp vision of a naturalist and the ingenuity of a philosopher to study human behavior and origin. The book tells you how humans evolved into what they are today. At the same time, this book also explores the unique self-destructive behavior of humans from the aspects of language, behavior and life cycle from a unique perspective. The book is full of curious and thought-provoking questions, and it is fun to read. It is very beautiful to read as an interesting popular science book! 
1	"It's a very interesting book. The childhood full of childishness is uncontrollable and makes people miss their childhood. If there is anything that can keep the flying time, there are only words. The vivid and lively language of this book describes the various interesting stories of two lovely primary school students, which makes people happy. I have read several books of Hou Wenyong, but what I find most interesting is that ""The Big Hospital and the Little Physician"" really makes you laugh. It is said that this book was also made into a TV series. It must be a very funny TV series. I like. "
1	The appearance is beautiful, and the XP modification is smooth, but there are still 3 unknown devices. In any case, the machine performance has nothing to say. 
0	I’m totally unworthy of the words “causing the trend of a third country”. I’ve never seen the feeling of the author writing like this. The author’s thinking is confused and often pops up some inexplicable words when creating. Disturbed personality too soon 
0	Nothing bad! When it was delivered, the box was slightly damaged and the seal was also broken, but after careful inspection, it was found that it had not been opened, which was a false alarm! It is recommended that the delivery staff be more careful when delivering goods in the future! 
1	The appearance is very good, the appearance is small, the keyboard is not as small as expected, it is very comfortable to use, and it is very suitable for girls. 
1	"The location is good, because Weihai is small, it doesn't cost much to take a taxi to the city. I booked a sea view room. The sea view cannot be said to be beautiful, but there is a sunrise to watch. Moreover, at a small fishing port by the sea at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the people who fished more and returned home, not just a scene. The front desk service is average and polite, but lacks sincerity, which is the professional feeling of ""have to be polite to customers"". The service of HOUSEKEEPING staff is very good. Additional comments September 28, 2007: The breakfast buffet is ok, just a bit flies. Maybe it was off-season when I went, in early September, only three or four people had breakfast "
1	1. The style is beautiful, the keyboard feels cool, and the business atmosphere is full. 2. High performance-price ratio, dual-core + 2G memory + 320G hard drive + 512M alone is only 5399. 3. The overall heat dissipation control is quite satisfactory. 
1	Stayed for two days on June 17, booked a semi-sea view room. It was raining on the day I went. Because I was not familiar with it, I took the subway to Sheung Wan Station and walked for more than 20 minutes. The reception attitude at the front desk was very good. Unfortunately, he said that the sea view room was full and could not be upgraded. It was a pity. Half sea view room with floor-to-ceiling windows, you can see the sea, but it is very close to residential buildings. The room is relatively clean, the bed is relatively large, and the room is a bit small compared to China, but it is said that a room of this size in Hong Kong is already very good. The hotel service is in place. Take the hotel’s free shuttle bus to take us to the Hong Kong and Macau Ferry Terminal. Only my husband and I, the driver is very nice. When you go out and turn left, you can sit in a car and the traffic is fairly convenient. And later I learned that the hotel is very close to the University of Hong Kong. I could go for a walk in the University of Hong Kong, but I might live again next time I have the opportunity. After reading other people's reviews, I found that the price of 678 is relatively high. Ctrip seems to have no advantage in price. 
1	The plot design can capture the children very well. The 6-year-old not only let the adults talk and talk, but also took the initiative to tell good friends. The painting effect is also acceptable. The children inadvertently browsed famous paintings of different styles in different periods. The fly in the ointment is that there is no difference in the plot design of different books in a set of books, only the age or style of the famous paintings are different. It is a pity why there are no exquisite picture books of the Chinese. From creativity, text to painting, good works are foreign, cultural taste is foreign, the next generation drink foreign milk, who will inherit the nutrients of the nation? ? ! ! ! 
1	"These books by Montessori are generally similar in content. The concluding remarks are ""Absorbent Mind"", which mainly explains the law of human development. As parents, they should be the spiritual servants of their children. Children find fun at work. There is a book dedicated to Montessori teaching aids. It is still very difficult to make by yourself, and it takes a lot of time to buy. I really hope that there is such a kindergarten where children can work. These books are quite good! "
0	The prawns helped out. I just bought it and partitioned today. I want to add Disk E. I made a mistake. As a result, I even lost the original 144G Disk D. Now there is only 1 Disk C. How to restore it? 
1	I bought all one to four books. Although there are many repetitions in the four books, the help for me to understand and be able to understand the Dream of Red Mansions is really great, ha ha! The part of this book talked about Xue Baochai’s love issue. In fact, many of the third parts have been said. Here is just some additional information, such as how the palace drafts, and the ranking of the ancient emperors’ wives and concubines, etc., which can be regarded as an increase in knowledge! As for the next part, the content is new, so I think all four books by Liu Xinwu are worth buying! 
0	The price falls so fast. It’s hot near the touchpad. The system installation costs a lot. 
1	This book can be said to be absolutely based on facts. I live in this environment. Although I am not in the deep mountains and forests, but listening to the narratives of old people from Ewenki, Oroqen, Daur and other ethnic groups, I am moved to correspond to this book again. There are several writers who have such rigorous writing. Liuba, I saw her drunk on the street when I was young, and heard her say that she didn't want to stay in a matchbox-like house. At that time, I didn't understand how a woman could lie presumptuous On the street. How warm the home is. Later I realized that this is not her home. This book speaks her heart. Good book. My recommendation to every book lover. 
1	3-star hardware, 4-star appearance, 5-star serviceThe room facilities are relatively outdated, but the service is very good, the first time any service staff in a 3-star hotel sees you will smile and say hello, if the facilities are better Is a nice hotel 
1	This book is very good. It tells us a lot of the author's own programming experience and 10 examples. I think this book is a good combination of theory and examples. Originally I was looking at the electronic version, but later I felt that I wanted to support the author's hard work. If we all only looked at the free electronic version, there would be no good authors to write for us. Also, it is not good for the eyes to read too much electronic version, so I bought the book. If a friend wants to buy a book, I still hope that they will read the Kazakhstan electronic version first, so that you can know if it is good. If it's good, buy a book 
0	This is the worst so-called four-star hotel built in the country where I live. The room is small and pitiful, and it can be said that it makes people unable to turn around. It seems to be only three stars at most. The waiter checkout speed is super slow, I waited for a half At the end of the hour, I asked a question, if it exceeds 4 minutes (12:04 when I waited), is there a half-day room charge. I hope that Ctrip will not list this hotel as a recommended hotel again. Report the situation of the room and the reception desk 
1	I have forgotten to review many times after staying. Now I have made up all of them. Since the end of last year, I have been there for two or three days a month. 
0	How to install the system in the future if the VISTA CD is not sent? There is no lock button on the screen, which feels unsafe! 
0	I can only say that the content is not what I want, it should not be suitable for me, I don’t like it very much, I just read a few pages and put it aside 
0	For the first and last time, the service is not proportional to the star rating, and the room facilities are also very average! 
0	Known as a four-star hotel, but the room is small, the internal facilities are at most equivalent to Motel 168, Jinjiang Inn and other simple hotels, it is really disappointing... 
0	The CD-Rom is a bit loud. The partition is not good. There is no CD-ROM driver. I want to reinstall the system, but I haven't found the driver yet. Can you tell the driver address? 
1	Stayed on March 19th, a total of two nights. Now I came up for the next review, ha ha. 1, the double bed room, although it is a more old hotel, but the cleanliness and environment are not bad! 2, service The staff are more enthusiastic, because their chargers are not available in the hotel. So in the middle of the night, they asked the front desk to send a travel charger. But the first three are not easy to use, the waiter ran up and down four or five times! But no A little bored! Finally, I repeatedly apologized to me! Great!!! 3, Western restaurant feels pretty good in terms of catering! Price and taste are not bad! As for Chinese restaurant, it feels average! The dishes have no special features, and they are more expensive! It took about 400 for a meal for one person, and I still haven't eaten enough! 4. The overall environment is very good! The greenery at the back is well done, and it feels deep and quiet! Haha 
1	Small and cute, the brightness of the LED screen is not bad, and it starts quickly. The battery is almost five hours 
0	Very fashionable and humorous style of writing, there is the momentum of talking and laughing. Although I have only read the first part, the feeling of loving it has become stronger and stronger. 
0	Don’t buy this book. It’s not suitable for national conditions. It expresses a concept when you go around. If you want to read to your children, just condense a book into one chapter. 
1	After reading it, I feel that this book is relatively well prepared in terms of materials, and the description is clear and complete. The fly in the ointment is that the domestic part of the case is not detailed in the overseas part, and may be related to less domestic materials, but the domestic part of the narrative is also very fair and complete, restoring its original appearance. 
0	This is the worst hotel I have stayed in Hong Kong. I booked a double-bed room, but I was given a twin-bed room for the first time. The second time I changed the room, it was a double-bed room, but the bathroom in this room was basically not decorated, all water pipes were exposed, and all equipment was It's simple, and the small washbasin can only be put in one hand, which is too scary. Everyone must be careful. As a result, for the third time, I finally changed to a slightly decent room (because I saw the room in front, all my vision has been much lower). But the room is really old. You can only take one person in the narrow aisle. It is recommended that if it is this budget, I would rather go to the Ramada Hong Kong, which is very close to this hotel, which is definitely newer than this hotel and is relatively close to Central. I have stayed at the Hong Kong Huamei Guangdong Hotel for almost 650 days, which is definitely better than this one. But this one finally has another advantage, that the breakfast buffet is very rich, but the price is actually much more expensive than the two hotels! 
1	"This is my first online novel since I bought it with money. There are no endings or there are more VIP novels on the Internet, but I can’t let go of it. Start with the old monster’s? If? I remembered a writer named ""Chihiro Chihiro"". Every book is heart-pounding, and it seems to have returned to the girlhood of a novel about buying Qiong Yao San Mao. Her words are soulful and can be precipitated. No wonder it was adapted into a TV series by the director. Looking forward to the publication of ""Wisteria"". . . "
0	Promoted to a three-star hotel, the quality of service is quite poor. The waiter does not even say hello when he meets the guests in the elevator~ and puts on a stinky face, making it uncomfortable to see! Will never stay in this hotel again! ~~ 
0	"This book is not as good as imagined. The central meaning of the book can be summarized in two sentences. ""As long as the child wants, parents should accompany their children to read with their children every day, and the sooner the parent and child read, the better"" ""Parents should set an example for children in reading !"". "
1	Tell me sincerely and frankly, not only the fiber side but also the wretched side (the debauchery caused by cultural differences is unacceptable and understandable! Sorry Yanni) He has been chaotic and decadent, but he can always find himself at the critical moment-the essential self! His ultimate achievement is attributed to his super self-control and concentration, which is almost unimaginable and understandable by ordinary people! Perhaps, without such dedication and persistence, it is impossible to create miracles. This book made me get to know Yanni and also deeply realized the price of success. Those who desire success but have no direction should take a look. 
1	It's super light~ It's easy to hold with one hand, and the appearance is simple and generous. I like it. The gift is very affordable. Memory, hard disk. Indirect upgrade. JD delivery is really fast. Orders were placed in the afternoon the first day and delivered the next morning. praise 
0	The stories are too long~~ and some are a little incomprehensible~~ I don’t like it~~ I can’t read two books~ 
1	The service attitude has nothing to say, from the doorman to the front desk, the level of service can be described as perfect. It gives people a feeling of going home, really kind. The room conditions are okay, I feel good when I live, but the bathroom shower facilities need to be improved, the faucet problem is very bad, and the drinking water inside is directly taken from the faucet, there is a lot of bleach, and the taste is very bad. (During the stay in the city due to pipeline maintenance to catch up with the water supply, it was very embarrassing, the front desk responded quickly when asked, and the attitude was good). The service really has nothing to say! The surrounding environment is very good. Although it is close to the downtown area, the environment is very quiet at night, and it is very close to the middle. It is convenient for shopping and dining. You can walk to the beach within a few minutes, and I feel very comfortable. Recommended 
1	I was very excited to read this book. very very good! There are several aspects that have inspired me greatly. (1) Description and understanding of the business system. The comparative analysis of business systems before and after optimization gives people the impression that it is very intuitive and easy to understand. (2) In terms of profit model, in-depth analysis on the matching of revenue and cost structure is very enlightening. (3) In terms of corporate value and cash flow structure, “a good business model is often to reduce the scale of investment, reduce operating capital, and at the same time enhance the continuous growth of free cash flow”. Incisive! 
1	1. Location: Convenient transportation, 40 Hong Kong dollars by car from Airport Express Kowloon Station, 80 Hong Kong dollars by car from Causeway Bay Times Square, Harbour City starting fee; Nathan Road is within walking distance, shopping is very convenient; 2. Environment: relatively quiet and comfortable For living; 3. Facilities: well maintained, but the facilities are old, traditional TV sets; 4. Food: The hotel has a wide variety of breakfasts, which is surprising; nearby restaurants also provide other options; 5. Service: staff are enthusiastic and proactive ； 
1	Generally speaking! This price can have such hardware conditions is not bad! Suitable for lovers dating do not want to spend a lot of money! 
0	After reading this book, I don't think it is as good as I imagined, but it's just a good publicity! You still have to read the book yourself to know the content, not just relying on rankings or other people's comments. 
0	My personal feelings are average, too many comprehensions and evaluations from the perspective of the third party, but the feelings of the readers are quite different. Almost can't stand it. Especially in the section where Heton and the radio host hosted the show together, the book talked about how smart the female psychologist is and how attractive the show is to the audience, but from the description in the book, I feel that if I hear this Radio programs must be changed! I also pointed out some passages specifically to my husband, and he refused to read it after reading one. I jumped and watched it at the end, with a feeling: the reputation is hard to lose! 
1	Overall it feels good, especially in the service details of the hotel. The milk delivered by the waiter in the evening and the flowers placed on the last night impressed Allah quite deeply. Of course, as long as you are in a good mood. Ha ha 
0	It's because the paper is thicker and sharper. My child broke his hand when he read the book for the first time and fainted...The publishing house didn't have any safety awareness!!! 
1	Song of Everlasting Hatred, I think Wang Qiyao is only pursuing her own happiness. From the time of Director Li, she pursued fame and wealth in youth, the stable life pursued by Cummison, and the lonely companionship pursued by Lao Kela in her old age, but her pursuit is shattered~ I think if Mr. Cheng did not commit suicide during the Cultural Revolution. Maybe Wang Qiyao in his later years would be willing. I would like to be accompanied by only kindness and no love~ A very good book~ Wang Anyi said that Wang Qiyao in her writing represents a The city is worth seeing~ 
1	Thin and small, the workmanship looks good. The most important thing is that the price is very cheap and win with the price-performance ratio. 
1	This is the fourth book in the CITIC Financial Frontier series. The author once worked at the two major investment banks on Wall Street-Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Through the description of investment banks, he revealed the truth about Wall Street. Greed has become the main theme of Wall Street. In fact, many truths on Wall Street may never be understood by outsiders, and they have no chance to understand, but the moral decay of Wall Street investment banks is obvious to all. If we have a chance to get their services in the future, we should really think about the weight of those pieced together project proposals. A book worth reading. 
1	Business big bed room, the room is very big, the bed is 2M wide, the overall feeling is economical and affordable! 
1	The child is going to elementary school right away and wants to buy a book suitable for him to read. The requirements are: simple words, attractive stories, and it is best for the child to have some inspiration or gain when reading. The online reviews are good. I have seen a few stories in the catalog before, which is good. I bought a set in the mood to give it a try. Reading aloud with the kids when we come home, we like it very much. It can be seen that all the articles are carefully selected by the editor. Except that there are a lot of new words for children (it doesn't matter if there are more words, you can read them by yourself), all the indicators have met the requirements. 
0	At first, I was going to book Hyatt, but the assistant made a mistake and booked Grand Hyatt. Simply evaluate the following. The counter service attitude is okay, but the room is very small. The most dissatisfied is the hotel fleet. At first I reserved a Toyota Crown, and then when I wanted to use the car, the counter told me that the Crown car was out, only Corolla, and then told me the price was 450 yuan, so I had to book it. After a while, the Corolla driver came over and said that the price was 550 yuan, and immediately raised the price. I think this is not a question of money, but a credit issue of the hotel. At noon, I was going to eat and asked the driver to pick me up at 12:30, but he did not show up until 12:30. I can only call Grand Hyatt. The most unbearable thing is that the driver kept on the phone while driving. I used the car for more than 5 hours that day, and the driver was on the phone for more than 3 hours. If you want to use a car when you stay in Grand Hyatt, don't use a Grand Hyatt car. Very poor quality. 
1	The hotel room is adjacent to the lake, with unobstructed views of the South Lake. The double room I booked was very unique and cheap. The food was delivered in a timely manner, the western pizza was made well, the service was in place, and the food delivery couldn't be used as an elevator, so I ran up, very dedicated! Broadband is fast, the computer desk is by the window, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery while surfing the Internet. 
0	I first saw my friend borrowed this book, studied it carefully, and found that it was good, and then I had the desire to buy it. I also found that there are many different versions, so I found the version I want to buy and my friend’s book online. When they are exactly the same, I chose your book next to the book, even if the price is more expensive than others (you are 18 yuan, the different editions are generally 16.5 yuan, 16.3 yuan, and 15.9 yuan) I would like to buy it. When the goods are opened, they are still in the diamond version. Why is it not the same as the normal version you posted on the Internet? It feels a bit deceived. Do I want to change the line? Can you give me a contact? Can we communicate? 
1	Reasonable configuration, fast speed, no system, no software. The screen is not broken. The appearance is okay, the first time I bought this, I didn't have much experience and didn't have much money. She was happy as a gift to my sister. 
0	The standard rooms are larger and the pick-up service is good. The reception desk service is not very good. After checking out and check out, make a local call at the reception desk and inform: 2 Jiao is required! 
1	The services are very attentive, the front desk staff are enthusiastic, the floor staff are attentive and meticulous, and the room service is fast and delicious! 
1	The goods sent from Guangzhou arrived two days after the order was placed. It was very fast and the accessories were complete. It is not a bad thing that the operating system is not pre-installed. Some people on the Internet say that this chipset uses sis, but in fact it still uses Intel. Friends who want to buy should rest assured. Perfect screen, and 2 years warranty, you can rest assured. end 
0	I'm getting more and more disappointed with the so-called bestsellers in Tibet. This book reads the same, no matter from the perspective of the novel or the psychological book, it is very inadequate. Some of Bi Shumin's novels are not bad. This one... is too disappointed. Up 
0	Ordinary apartment rooms, poor service level, not suitable for business travel personnel. 
1	People who have read Wu Danru's writing should be clearer, and her articles are generally not boring and preaching. It is very interesting to read, even if it is about a lot of doctrines, it is more vivid in her expression. As a result, the subjective color of this book is stronger. Of course, for many readers (scholars) who are pursuing theoretical norms of lean, this book may not be very suitable. But it is indeed suitable for many people who are willing to learn how to improve themselves from all angles, and it is especially recommended for young women. 
1	The service attitude is really good and makes people feel comfortable. When I checked out, I was told that there was a piece of clothing forgotten in the room. I wanted to go back to get it, but they insisted on letting the waiter bring it for me. Everyone who enters and exits the hotel will smile at you, bend over and nod in greeting. I personally like the surrounding environment, the feeling of a small town. There are several shortcomings. One is that the floor is too low, it seems to be only 4 floors. We live on the first floor, which feels very strange. Second, the soundproofing of the room is not good, and I always hear people talking outside the window. Other hotels usually have taxis waiting in front, but here you have to go outside to take a taxi. 
0	The battery capacity is still too small, after all, it is only 4 cells. The memory is also too little, but fortunately I have a 2G, also 1066DDR3. Compared with the T43 I used before, the machine is still a lot thicker, but the price is a lot different. 
0	Quite boring book! I suggest you JM to take a look, and keep your wallet secure (I don’t know if writing a comment like this will be harmonized, no matter what!) 
0	To be honest, I bought this book to follow the trend and follow the trend. I regretted it when I bought it. Hehe, maybe I don’t like this kind of woman’s historical perspective. 
0	The pre-installed system actually has two other drive letters: Recover and HP_TOOLS. If you add two more, it will appear to have a lot of drive letters. 
1	I bought this book a long time ago because of its long-standing reputation. After reading it, I felt that it made me feel a way of pursuing a better life, making life more refined, and to a certain extent more complicated, maybe, simple life Complication is not blindly derogatory. It is just to see what kind of complexity we are after. After seeing these things, we hope to pass it on to more people, so I bought many of them in one go. , I want to give it to the girls around~ 
0	That is: the driver of the belt cannot be installed on xp, and it prompts that it cannot be installed. After installing xp, there is no graphics card, network card and other drivers, which is very bad. 
1	Because of the eagerness, I searched many places on the Internet for the ending of the final chapter. In fact, the ending is already clear. However, because the process of reading him is quite special, I decided when I read the first book. You must own all four books. And this set is really worth it. Almost everyone of my colleagues read it in turn. When I finally got this book, I borrowed it from my colleague before I could finish it. After reading the middle part, it was the same as before. Moved, the delicate emotions between the lines, although not as vigorous as the previous ones, but still I love. I also want to read the ending of this beautiful and sad story with my own eyes. So. 
0	I bought three books: <Seeking a doctor is worse than asking yourself>, <Don't laugh at me, I am an English vocabulary book>, and Dangdang only gave me two books. Dangdang.com from now on I have been disappointed in you!!!! I will not buy anymore!! So sad!!! 
0	The reception staff of this hotel has no professional ethics at all. I have booked this hotel several times before. Normally, because there are few guests, there is no conflict with them. Because they said that they want to receive a group, in order to make room, they must force the guests to check out, and their attitude Bad, arrogant words, and deceived that there are other rooms, to lure guests out first. Then say there are no vacancies. This kind of deception caused me to fail to book a room in other hotels in time! ! ! Just one word! ! Bad, so bad! Extremely bad! 
1	I started to read the comments of several friends in 2005, but I didn't dare to move in. Unexpectedly, it has changed a lot now. The room is small but tidy. I will choose this hotel again next time. I just hope that broadband will always be free! 
1	Last week, I happened to run into the class reunion. I have already ordered at this time, but have not received the book yet. One of them is very knowledgeable. I lost no time in asking about Nan's situation. In fact, I wanted to ask very early, but it was not easy to bother him. According to him, Nan is not very recognized by the domestic academic circles because he writes very casually and does not demand academic methods, such as many quotations. However, this person is very well-educated and has a good understanding of ancient Chinese culture. His family also has a few books that he said, which is really good. Anyway, I am not an academician. I suggest I still buy some. 
1	This machine, I didn't find any good points! Wait for my constant complaints! . . . (The following evaluation does not allow more writing, too much writing can not be sent) 
0	The economy room staying in has a strong musty smell as soon as the door is opened, and there is no window. The price of 255 is not worth it. If you live in another hotel, it may be better 
1	Because he watched this cartoon of Central Children's, my son clamored to watch it every day, but the TV program always had to be changed. Fortunately, I found this book on Dangdang.com! Thank you so much! ! In this set of books, my son is a treasure, and he pesters me to tell him stories about the little train almost every day, and he knows all the little trains in it. Sometimes I can't tell which is Edward and Thomas, but he can recognize it at a glance. The children from the neighbor's family came to my house to play, and they liked it very much. It seems that this set of book god children loves it! Not bad!! 
1	I bought it for my colleagues, the price is cheap, and the configuration is good! It makes me feel that I am always superstitious about foreign brands, is it unwise? 
1	I was hesitating between 12 and 14 inches before I bought it. It was too heavy or the screen was too small, but I didn’t regret it after I bought it. I like it very much. 
0	It took an afternoon to change linux to xp. If the heat dissipation is not good, the cpu temperature has not fallen below 50, and the game can reach 70, which is scary. The touchpad cannot be turned off, and I often encounter it when typing. 
0	Lenovo's program is different from our usual computer program, and the leveling bought on JD does not enjoy home repair 
1	I'm sorry, I was quick for a while, and the last sentence was typed incorrectly. It turns out that there is a kind of affection that always affects our hearts, and that is the indelible deep affection between us and our loved ones! Hahaha. Please support. 
1	High performance-price ratio, the fan is quiet, and the office fan basically does not sound, the first one, satisfactory 
1	I bought a lot of children's books recommended by Dangdang for my daughter, such as Skerry, Arrow, and Carmela. My daughter is not very interested. She is the only one who reads the Romi series without annoying. Every night I read a story about Romi before going to bed. She can repeat many stories. Through this book, I truly realized that the right is the best. Through this book, my daughter compares with Romi, those things Romi can do and he can do, and those behaviors should be corrected, and learn common sense through Romi and behavior. I bought several sets of the Romi series and my daughter's age. 
0	The room tastes so heavy, I used to live in Huatian Century. Their business is too good and there are no rooms. Regent’s room feels like it’s been unoccupied for a long time. The smell is so musty. After two days of staying, people are almost dizzy If you go to Liuzhou again, you will definitely not live in this one. Hotel Feedback August 1, 2008: We have made improvements to your comments. The hotel has a non-smoking floor, and also launched a luxurious new business executive room, you will not be disappointed! 
0	Less memory! The driver is not very complete! The sound card driver installation needs to install KB888111 patch first! To install! 
0	I bought it after reading the reviews, and I found that it is not so good. I don't like this style very much. My son doesn't like to read it. Maybe girls will like this kind of book? 
1	However, for some conspiracy theories, I will be suspicious. I searched the Internet and everyone was talking about it. The most detailed one I want to write is Tianya's article. http://cache.tianya.cn/publicforum/content/develop/1/ 140524.shtml Academic controversy is a good thing, but when I think about it, this book does have a bit of a fictional history 
1	"This is a story that An Yiru loves very much. It is a novel recommended by her. I am her loyal reader and never doubt her taste. When I finished reading this novel, my admiration for quail went even further. This is really a fascinating story, a work that can bring excitement to your heart. I may have finished reading it in more than 2 hours, and it surprised me because it is not entirely written, but has sound There are pictures. The exquisite illustrations and beautiful bookmarks inside make the characters of the book form images in your mind. The singing of ""citrus and lemon"" seems to be reverberating in the distance. "
1	"Suddenly I heard the child laughing in her own room. I couldn't help asking what happened. I was watching ""Don't Laugh!"" I am an English word book. I was curious, so I took the time to pick up the book and flip through it... I laughed too. This book is really interesting, and the words I have read can stay in my memory (memory is declining at my age), which I didn't expect. It turns out that words can also be learned like this? ! So encourage the children to read this book well, not only to remember words, but also to tell jokes to classmates on appropriate occasions, it might not be a meaningful thing. "
0	"A very poor hotel, although the lady at the front desk solemnly declared to you that it was ""two-star"" when opening the room. When entering the door, there was a smell in the room. Insert the card on the wall to get electricity? Useless, just press the button to turn on the light ; Go into the bathroom to take a bath and turn on the faucet, and the water spouts from the pipe. A closer look shows that the pipe and the faucet of the shower have been broken into two parts. The hotel is simply tied together with black tape; after finally washing it, leave the bathroom , I was shocked when I heard the loud rumbling inside, and then I saw that it was the sound of flushing the toilet upstairs. Of course, this sound continued throughout the night-as long as the toilet was upstairs. It was a night after all. , I got up in the morning and called the restaurant to order breakfast. I was told that the room would not be delivered, and there would be a handling fee for delivery; I finally went out to check out, and there was a big puddle of water on the ground when the door was opened. In the middle of the night, I finally left the room and it started to rain again. I asked the lady at the front desk to take an umbrella for a three-minute drive to the Beihai bus station next to me. I was told to go to the security by myself. I begged for a long time to slow down. Swallow the ground to arrange; finally can't bear the hunger and go to the restaurant on the second floor to eat. A hard and unpalatable fried rice sells for 18 yuan. When the meal is delivered, a pack of napkins is thrown on the table and you will be charged immediately. Two yuan.---I don’t want to give a penny to this broken hotel anymore---If I can afford this money, we can’t stand the gas---It's better to live in a hotel of 80 yuan in Guilin This is much better... "
0	I received the notebook from SF Express at noon on Tuesday. It is very good. There is only a small question. It is not that the backlight of the led screen is turned off when it is completely black, but I can still see the white light leakage under the screen, which makes me feel Is Lenovo fooling us? Or I am wrong? Ha ha 
1	I just stayed for 3 days at the end of October, and it feels really good. The room is big enough and clean. Although it is close to the street, the sound insulation effect is not bad. At least the service attitude was very good when I stayed. Let me get a hair dryer soon. , I took a few packs of tea very quickly. My only regret is that I don’t provide credit card consumption. However, there is an ATM at the door, and I can’t check out one hour later, which is a computer system problem. Overall I feel that 230 is very good. 
1	The services in the rooms and restaurants are good, and the reception desk is also very fast. But there seems to be no phone on the floor. I forgot to bring my room card and got down to the reception desk. The elevator was a bit slow. 
1	The business standard room is relatively large, but the bathroom is very small. The sound insulation effect is not very good. Generally speaking, it is clean and tidy. The traffic is very convenient and it is very close to Jing'an Temple. 
0	"A very unpleasant experience!!! The hotel service is in a mess!!! I checked in at around 3pm and the room was not cleaned! I went through the formalities (paid the deposit), and then got the room card at night. In this way, it was even a big deal for Ctrip Said I did not check in!!! It took more than a week to confirm! The room rate is not advantageous compared to the hotel (very objective! There is no evil) New hotels across the street are everywhere! Except for the big room, everything else is average, special The soundproofing can’t be worse, it’s a great place for people who have time and like to listen to live sex next door! I ""appreciated"" all night! The feeling of ""immersive""!!! Anyway! I will never again Went to this hotel!!! "
0	The hotel is relatively old, close to the airport, and can hear a lot of noise. And the breakfast was very poor, there was nothing to eat. I will never stay in this hotel again. Hotel feedback March 14, 2008: Dear guest, thank you very much for your valuable comments, we apologize for the unpleasant experience you encountered during your stay, the following is our feedback on your comments: 1. Regarding the noise and obsolescence of the hotel you mentioned, as the hotel is located in the west section of Huli Avenue, the main arterial line in Xiamen, a 10-minute drive from the airport, this is the main advantage of the hotel’s convenient transportation. But then comes the noise problem. Xiamen Lianfa Group invested heavily in the renovation of the hotel in May 2007, and made the greatest improvements and enhancements in sound insulation. Since the hotel was renovated and put into use, no complaints from guests about noise have been received. 2. Breakfast: For the team-oriented breakfast in the past few years, the hotel has made great improvements in staffing and breakfast types and quantities. At present, breakfast includes more than 40 side dishes, drinks, hot dishes, pastries, staple food, salads, etc. Grow dishes to meet the different preferences of various customers. We cherish every customer's complaint very much, and cherish every opportunity to provide service to our guests. Maybe the hotel is not perfect yet, but we have been working hard. I hope you can visit Li Xuan Hotel again and feel our changes. Finally, thank you again for your comments and suggestions, because it is because of guests like you that Lixuan has been improving and improving. Thank you! 
1	A good hotel with new facilities and convenient transportation, but it is a bit away from the city center and convenient to the airport. 
1	I originally wanted to find a book about classic remarks on both sexes that I read in middle school, but I didn't find it, but I found this one by Zhou Guoping. Zhou Guoping's Niuniu had seen introductions in major newspapers and magazines a long time ago, but never looked for them. But this book, I believe it is worth reading by every man and woman. Life requires wisdom, and it is the same for both sexes. Love and marriage, although not the whole of life, are undoubtedly the most important part of achieving happiness in life. Everyone should be taken seriously. This book can benefit everyone. 
0	I was admired to buy a copy, but I was disappointed. This kind of work is a show that a petty bourgeoisie feels good about herself, but so many people love it, and the level of fans can be imagined. I regret buying this book and pay me back! NND. 
0	I was misled by the comments of Dangdang.com, thinking that this is a good book that would leave regrets if I didn’t buy it or read it. I bought it quickly after I found it. After reading a few pages, I was really deceived. This is like a book about history. The style of ridicule throughout the text, the Internet language, the vernacular, and even many sentences contain language problems, which is really misleading. 
0	JD.com is fooling people. The Yuantong I chose sent me a free economic EMS, which cost me 8 yuan! 
0	The only advantage of this book is that I understand what hype is! In this world, all three teachers and nine liu are here to write books, and they became best sellers accidentally! I think writing reviews should be based on conscience, because our reviews may affect the choices of other customers. Most of the things in this book are my own experience. As for the scientific basis, she doesn't know how to say it. I personally think it is not credible. Hope everyone will consider it! 
1	The overall workmanship is decent, the screen has a lot of face, and the hard disk is large enough. The independent graphics card is ati's 3430 but not the 3410. The performance is sufficient. The configuration is sufficient, and it is no problem to surf the Internet and watch movies. Install with ghostxp without installing the driver. 
1	Although this hotel is a bit away from the city center, the scenery and services are particularly good. The hotel has complete facilities and is within walking distance to the sea. The hotel can also contact the driver for you and deliver breakfast to your room in advance at no extra charge. The hotel's dining tastes can basically meet various requirements. Next time you come to Weihai, I will stay in this hotel. 
1	The hotel has complete facilities and good service. Very close to the sea, suitable for a walk at night 
0	I bought it because I saw that the book review was well written, but after I bought the book, my son didn't like it at all. 
1	I was very happy when I got this set of books. The two books are not expensive together. I finished reading two days after I got the book. I really hope that this book can be thicker, especially the concept and method of life and doing things written in Method 1 After reading it, people suddenly became clear and admired Kazuo Inamori very much. He is not only the sage of management, but a wise man who teaches us the Tao. If entrepreneurs can achieve his level, then there will be no more deception. . This book is worth reading for a long time. The reasoning in it is thought-provoking. When you are upset and empty, you will be moved by him if you turn over this book. 
0	Without MIC, the biggest problem is that the keyboard is soft, and the steel plate under the left Ctrl key is tilted up to withstand the Ctrl key and cannot be pressed. At the same time, the'Left Arrow' has one end tilted up, and there is no technical staff because it is mentioned on Sunday I'm very upset to deal with it. I will deduct 4 points for this. I don’t have time to return the goods. 
0	I am very interested in books on Chinese medicine. Seeing that this book is so popular and many readers have commented on it very well, I bought it with great enthusiasm. As a result, I was very disappointed and disappointed. The viewpoints in the book lack scientific basis, so I won't say it, and I can't even justify it. The metaphor is novel but unreasonable. After each article or paragraph puts forward a point of view, many of the things that follow have nothing to do with the point of view. It is completely messy and wrong. There are so many people who like this book, but there is no choice but to sigh. 
0	Very general, the service attitude is not good. When I left, there was a sealed carton box that needed to be taken down for help. I first checked out at the front desk and asked someone to help take it down. In just ten minutes, the room round waiter did it without authorization I took apart my sealed cardboard box and looked at the contents. When I waited for the doorman who was helping to take the cardboard box up, I was very angry and questioned the waiter. The waiter was still eloquent and convinced. I don’t know if there are valuable things and I just took them away, but luckily it’s just some information. 
0	Very troublesome when installing xp. The driver now has an unknown device and does not know anything. Everything else was driven. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, just across the street is the bustling Nanjing Road, and very close to the subway station. The hardware of the hotel is good among the 4 stars, and the service is also very good. It may have been opened for a long time, the room is a bit old, and the price of close to 1000 a night is not free and it is a bit inhumane. Maybe Shanghai's slightly higher-end hotels are like this. Overall it is quite satisfactory, will consider staying next time. 
0	After reading the online introduction, I bought this book. I was dumbfounded. It was too young to read. Our child didn’t look it right. What should I do? The customer service is busy...I wonder if it is a fake You should pay attention to online shopping in the future. 
0	I just bought it after reading a lot of good reviews on the Internet. I feel cheated. Is this a good book? The picture is gloomy. In fact, the original purpose of the book is very good, but after copying it from abroad, the picture is really ugly, it is really not interesting at all. Want to retire! ! ! 
1	In the story, Sun Bo, Xiaolang, painter, everyone is living hard, just like our society, many people are lingering and panting, always a little helpless. After Xiao Lang's death, the painter killed his wife, and Sun Bo finally went mad. Everyone seemed to be escaping from suffering. Everyone seemed to be freed. As everyone knows, the people around him were even more injured. The story has always been told by people of different identities. From the perspective of sending everyone, there is a sad tone. Maybe you will feel very depressed after reading this book, but this is life. Everyone has a different perspective, but I like this book very much! 
1	I thought that the old wine in new bottles was just the publisher who sold Mao’s old articles. After reading it, it is not. Ashamed. After experiencing the completeness of Mao’s old thinking framework and the meticulous way of thinking, the viewpoints demonstrated are always so novel, unexpected, thought-provoking, and comprehensible, rather than confusing. His thoughts have reached the realm of freedom. It is recommended that Mr. Mao produce more new products and indicate the date of writing. At the same time more writing and color (maybe Mr. Mao was studying mathematics at the beginning), haha! 
0	"I originally booked a standard villa room. The lady at the front desk enthusiastically recommended us the ""ultra-ultra-luxury ordinary standard room"" for us to stay in, saying that it was better than the one I had booked on the Internet. There was a peculiar smell when I entered. It’s an old-fashioned lane where no one has lived in hundreds of years. We later strongly requested the hotel to give us the original villa room. It was indeed different, but it made us feel very bad. I think this is also the hotel Means. "
0	It was very hot. After I bought it, it was printed beautifully, but I felt it was not deep enough. Not worth collecting. But you can consider reading to your children after reading, it's a choice to get in touch with traditional culture from the shallower to the deeper. 
1	Yu Hua's life is a work of the last century, but it is of great significance to readers today. The protagonist Fugui’s life was rough and rugged, but he persisted. His relatives left him one by one. How much shock he had to endure in his heart, but he still insisted that he felt that he was living for the dead and for his relatives. To be alive is a very sacred topic. For today's people, there is a lot of pressure from all aspects, but how to deal with it, some will live, some will commit suicide and so on. I believe this book will be enlightening 
1	I stayed in Building 5 for 3 days and I felt pretty good. Both the guest rooms and the staff in the catering department can give guests a sincere smile. The transportation is convenient near the hotel and not far from the city center and various scenic spots. Will come next time live. 
1	"A few more words: There are many real masters who can be used as the standard for the title of master, and Kubrick is such a one. If you mistakenly think that a certain director in China today is also a master, you can look at Kubrick and watch ""Open Eyes"" to compare the gaps that are not easy to calculate. If any director really has the goal of becoming a master in your lifetime, I also advise you to watch ""Open Eyes"" and set yourself a benchmark. "
1	"I am a mother of a 4-year-old child. The educational philosophy of ""no matter what"" is the best and ""management"" in the book impressed me very deeply. Now most families have one child, and parents always want to give their children comprehensive care. I dare not ""let go"". I think that a child needs the love of parents to grow up healthily, and it also requires the parents to ""wait"" patiently; I am very grateful to Yuanyuan's mother for bringing this book. It is necessary to make repeated scrutiny, let the parents agree, and only after a correct understanding can face the ""problems"" in the child's growth process with a peaceful mind. "

The driver CD is Vista, and the drives in the hard disk are not all XP. The XP driver must be downloaded from the website. A driver cannot be installed in the XP system. 
0	The hard disk capacity of 160G, the actual viewing partition is only a little more than 140G, call ASUS sales, explain what there are hidden partitions... Can’t figure it out~ The black surface is easy to get fingerprints 
1	I have stayed in Baidu’s Caiba for a long time, so I have read all the novels, and also read various translations of adults in the bar, but I’m so happy to see the original book! Hurry up and buy one and keep it at home, hahahaha~ Because the speed of delivery of books in Xiamen is much slower than that in Shanghai, I haven’t received the books until I left home. However, I heard that the quality of paper and copying is not very good. There is room for change~ the publisher, come on and publish all the books as soon as possible. If the latest book is not translated by Taiwanese publishing house, it is also available in Baidu. It can be published quickly and I believe it will be very popular 
1	Small and light, large capacity, fast speed, good color and luster... It is a good choice for the brother who is going to propose! 
1	The built-in software is pretty good, and ASUS’s phone service is nothing to say. It’s not bad. It’s not annoying to make calls for more than an hour due to the network card upgrade. 
0	Tell us how to achieve their goals step by step with their own efforts in today's highly competitive environment, especially foreign companies. Of course, the main person, Lala, is very cute. We have to learn from her serious and persistent work, always good at summarizing problems when encountering problems, and good at dealing with people up and down the company. 
1	The decoration of the lobby and room is luxurious and very good. It is very close to Guangzhou. Recommend. 
0	With 70-year-olds and children, I booked 3 rooms just because it was 4 stars. Good guy, don't say that the room is not soundproof, the shower faucet fell off when touched, and the water was not hot yet. I booked a room for Thursday and Saturday, and I lived on Thursday, but I said there was no order on Saturday. The whole family is looking for a local hotel with their luggage! (Don't say, the attitude of the deputy manager in the lobby is very good! It just doesn't work.) Finally, I stayed in a local 3-star hotel, the price is cheap, not only the service is good, the room is much better. But don't really believe in any ‘star’, it’s too unrealistic. 
1	"[Recommended Book]: To add, ""The Secrets of the Sea"" is suitable for all readers. It is wordless, borderless, full of love, and can be eternally youthful and needs to be read carefully. "
0	Many friends around me watched it and said it was pretty and interesting. I bought it and read a few pages, and found it didn't match my taste. I don't like this type of historical novels, my wife is too teasing. 
1	This is indeed an interesting book, and adults will smile happily after reading it. However, I personally feel that being naughty, disruptive, and making “mistakes” are inherently children’s nature. This is a unique way for them to learn and grow. To a certain extent, parents can let them play freely without strict interference, especially for For children before the age of 3, in fact, you tell him a lot of truths, it is not as effective as a personal experience. On the contrary, too much truth is said to be harmful. The happiness of the baby is the happiness of the parents. Please correct me for the above points. 
0	I took two system disks, XP SP2 and SP3, from my classmates. I clearly remembered putting them in the CD-ROM drive, but they were empty when I opened the CD-ROM drive again! Depressed, embarrassing, scary! 
0	Such a man overdone his head tenderly, unable to find a trace of manhood. Only say: This is good. . . This is also good. . . I can't appreciate the beauty of such writing. Love is also strange. Zhang Ailing fell in love with such a person, faintly, probably for a lifetime. 
0	I don't think people who are bored should not read this book. After reading it, it is super depressed. It is a very bored book. I can only say that~~ 
0	The inner bag provided is relatively poor. Due to the battery, the weight is slightly heavier. The design is not prominent, but it is still not integrated. The biggest problem is the upgrade. There is no spare memory expansion slot. If you upgrade, Need to use 2G sliver to replace the built-in 1G sliver, very bad! ! 
0	We spent three days in Tianjin and this hotel was the worst. First of all, the management is chaotic, and there are various reasons for arriving at the hotel. There is no room you want to book. The room is very poorly ventilated. The control switch is aging and malfunctioning. If you want to turn off the light at night, you can only turn on the bulb. Hotel. 
0	The room is very poor, it feels like a ghost, the service is also very poor, the water must be provided by yourself, in short, this hotel is definitely not recommended! 
1	The books are beautifully printed, and there are many constellation maps that my son likes very much. Put him on the bedside and flip through the books every night before going to bed. The book design is suitable for both adults and children. It can be kept at home for a long time and children grow up. If I can keep flipping through it, I occasionally flip through it. My son hopes that I will buy another astronomical telescope for him so that he can see the sky against the star chart. This book is a mature content design, not naive, but a child It also understands that it is very good for children to have a deeper understanding of sky astronomy, and it is also suitable for adults who love astronomy. worth it. 
1	Only after reading it did I know that Ji Lao is a university scholar with a firm belief in materialism. In this way, he cannot be required to write articles that conform to Buddhist traditions. Ji Lao's book can only be read as a purely academic book. To learn Buddhism, this book is very inappropriate for ordinary people. At the beginning, I thought that my husband was a famous religious research master, and he studied his thoughts respectfully and respectfully, and even the superficial comments on the practice of the Pure Land in the book, that is, treat it like soil, and only read it as academic materials. But these do not prevent me from liking Ji Lao's book. The writing is fresh and concise. 
0	"In Dangdang, the one-time order is more than 600 yuan, but the delivery person only delivers the goods downstairs, saying: ""Your book is so heavy, I only earn you 1.5 yuan, I can't send you upstairs. If you don't take it yourself , Then I will take the book away."" I don't know why the conflict between you has to involve our consumers. We did not pay a penny less. Please Dangdang give me a reasonable explanation. "
1	It's suitable to take out every time, you will feel different every time, trust me 
1	The performance is good and meets daily needs. I especially like the shape of the 550. It is very handsome. The 15-inch large screen looks very cool. Like it, Dolby sound is very good~~ Support Lenovo 
0	It’s not fun to feel like buying it is a waste 
0	I think buying this book is totally equivalent to dropping the money in the gutter, which is not worth it. I advise everyone not to buy it. I will regret it, like me. Not as good as other books. 
1	I bought it for my daughter, and I thought it was a literary story, but I didn’t expect it to be the author’s personal experience in childhood. I really envy the children of Pakistan Academy. I am full of respect for Principal Kobayashi. Is there a teacher who loves children and understands children? It is far from our real life&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183 ;It is difficult to meet a teacher like Principal Kobayashi, but it's not too difficult to be a mother like Xiaodoudou. I have heard one sentence: Parents’ hearts are the best school for children! 
0	No system is not good, it takes time to install it yourself, and there are problems with the graphics card and the camera driver! The graphics card has to be installed twice, otherwise Direct3D will not start! 
0	Everyone says that this book contains a lot of psychological cases, but what kind of cases do I think? Isn't it a story compiled by the author, and it lacks analysis. What is a supplementary reading of psychology, I think it is just to string together some stories, and then disrupt the order. It is recommended for those who like to read novels, but if you really want to learn something about psychology, then forget it. 
1	Good battery! Available for 5-6 hours, the keyboard is not bad! The price is ok, much lower than X61! The comparison aspect of testing in remote networking! 
0	Yu Dan’s experience, I have watched it on TV and on the Internet. I remember that the teacher showed it to us when I was in college. Now I read a book, so I bought one, and I read it and it feels good, as well as bookmarks. The printing is in color and very good. I don’t know what’s wrong with the score in the last comment, it’s very bad? I don’t know if it can be changed, it should be very good, I like it 
1	The hotel is located in the city center, very convenient. Although I don't have time to see it, I heard that there are many attractions nearby. Generally speaking, the hotel's service is still very good, but the room is relatively small, and it should be a separate small room with two rooms closed. The hardware does not feel that it can reach the 5-star standard. The French restaurant on the third floor is good. 
0	I wanted to read this book with great joy, but I couldn't think of a guy in Dangdang who actually gave me two books that were completely unmatched! ! After buying things for so long in Dangdang, this is the first time I have encountered this. I'm furious! ! 
0	Generally speaking, like the textbook, the characters only have the character of the author but not their own. The documentary summarizes the novel, ha ha 
0	The comfortable feeling of staying at this hotel several times before makes me think that it is an inevitable choice to live in Hong Kong again. Now it seems that the reality is really cruel! ! ! -When I arrived at the hotel at noon to check in, I started to have problems: I could not find the name of the person who checked in; I finally found the name of the person and the room type was wrong. The front desk staff of the hotel sternly said that Ctrip did not explain when they booked the room with them and cannot change the room. After more than two hours of tripartite negotiations back and forth, the hotel gave us a free extra bed and said that we would change the room the next day. Then no one took care of us. As a result, we stayed with an extra bed for four days. It wasn't until the fifth day that we changed a company reservation, the hotel adjusted the room we needed, and finally ended the extra bed trip these days. The attitude of the staff at the front desk of the hotel is blunt. The ultra-mini room is in sharp contrast with the time when I lived at this time. This made me feel that the beautiful things are not static. More choices are the best way to adapt. 
0	The memory is small, the speakers are just like that, but the sound card is too bad, I connected the Hivi 1010, the sound is obviously different from the desktop 
0	When you read it as a textbook, it is only suitable for a rookie in the workplace. It does not see any value, and it has been praised by so many people. When it comes to novels, the writing style is really not very good, and I really hate the heroine in the book. It looks perfect, but in fact there is an image of a self-righteous little Shanghai woman in my bones. 
0	The linux system is a bit troublesome. I haven’t installed a windows system on the linux system before, and I haven’t got it done after two or three hours. Later, I found a lot of relevant information on the Internet to get it right. If this system is installed, I suggest that it is not equipped. Good, or dos 
1	Configuration equalization, 3dmarker06 test 2405 points. The battery is about 3 hours. The heat dissipation is a bit worse. The system is unstable with Depth 9.0 and will have a blue screen. Later, I switched to Dragon Empire gost 7.50326 and everything was normal. 
1	The rooms are large in size, the service is fair, and generally satisfactory. 
0	It is really not recommended for everyone to live there. If you don't have a car, the price is expensive and the location is poor. The first time I met a hotel that didn't even call you a car. He even asked the guests to take the big box and walk for 20 minutes to hit the black car. This is the worst hotel I have ever encountered. If there are zero points, call it first. 
0	"One word: bad, bad, bad, bad attitude. We stayed from July 22nd to July 27th and opened two rooms. If it weren't for being too busy at work and lazily changing rooms, it would have long been unbearable. The first day I checked in was good, and the room was clean; after a few days, things continued. 1. My colleague’s clothes disappeared in the room (all other things are there), and I asked them what was going on, but they pushed the other one, and the other one, but they didn’t get rid of it, and finally they didn’t find it. 2. Our room didn’t have a pillow. I asked the waiter for one. The waiter said there was no more. I said to go to another room to get one. The waiter later said that the leader did not approve, and they could not move other rooms. They could only help with the reaction. It. 3. We didn't change the sheets and quilt covers after we slept for four days. Later, we took the initiative to mention them, but only changed a bed after mentioning them. Fourth, this is the most irritating thing, and the anger that has been held for a few days finally broke out. We had breakfast on the last day. Since we got up late, we planned to eat breakfast and lunch together (due to catching the flight). The owner of the small restaurant was very good. If lunch was not good, I would get you some leftover breakfast and stir fry right away. For this dish, we only need to charge us breakfast rolls. If we ask the front desk for meal rolls, the front desk said it would not give it, saying that the breakfast time has passed, we said, the restaurant is willing, why don’t you give it, and then I became angry. Today I have to. As a result, the lobby manager (looks like), since he took the table for me, he couldn't help but say ""give him, give him"". Later, I asked the hotel restaurant owner why their service attitude is so poor and why they are like state-run ones. The little boss said that “it was originally state-run”. I saw that quarrels are common here. I said no wonder, I vowed to come again. Later, I called the customer service department of Ctrip and suggested not to recommend such hotels to guests. I was really angry. "
0	The author has obvious narcissistic tendencies, and only wives who have a husband who is not working can live like her. Many methods are not practical, and there are suspects of plagiarism, which is boring, and you can save if you don't buy it. 
1	The most unbearable thing is that broadband is charged, 12 yuan per hour! Black. . . Just stayed for one night, and the others felt pretty good.

0	More than 500 prices, an economic room, the room is very small, it is difficult to turn around inside, the shower is also poor, the quilt is not clean, the cover is itchy, the room is not ventilated, the air is poor, and the sound insulation effect Very poor, I can hear everything in the next house, and I was awakened by a drunkard knocking on the door in the middle of the night. This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. Don't live there. Many budget hotels in the development zone are better than it it is good!! 
0	That's hilarious! After staying so many times in hotels, the hotel did not charge parking fees, but Dongdu Hotel charged parking fees, and did not explain in advance! ! ! When a soldier came to charge me for parking fees, I yelled at him, stunned him first, and then screamed while he was dazed! The voice is still very loud, a posture of asking for money is not fatal, and in the end the charges are directly stunned, and finally there is no charge! This method can be used as a reference for people who walk in this hotel in the future! (This method must not be imitated, the failure to pay this time is pure fluke) As for other thoughts, the same as those of the person who made the comment, one word: bad! I advise everyone to stay three or four before staying in the store! 
0	No anti-virus software is given, only 60 days of use. The price is high. In some places, 2900. Because it is anxious to use, it is convenient to place an order. It may be due to the battery, the machine is a bit heavy. Really fight fingerprints. 
1	The hotel hardware should be good, but the location is relatively far away from the city center and business district is not very convenient, when I went there just happened to catch a taxi strike, it was quite inconvenient to travel. But because it is right across from the city hall, the people who come to the restaurant to eat are basically the people who work there, so the restaurant is good. If you do not consider the traffic problem, it is recommended to choose! ! 
1	Early, the hotel environment is very good. But Dingshan Tower is still far from the main building 
0	I bought a book that I read at the time, but I didn’t like it very much after reading it. Personally, everyone has different feelings when reading the book. 
0	"I think it’s average, it’s almost the same as the ""Women Want to Be Rich"" I bought before &#183;no actual content &#183; "
0	The hardware is decent. The service standard is too bad. The front desk staff seemed to be silly, all pretending to be stupid, asking three questions! ! In addition, there is no broadband access in the Japanese-style standard room, which is inconsistent with the advertised on their website. If you use the telephone line to access, there is an additional charge! ! For this reason, when negotiating with the front desk, the waiter and the foreman were arrogant and insulting! ! Don't know what the service industry is! ! I think this kind of service will close this resort sooner or later! ! ! 
1	"The quality is good, suitable for children around 3 years old. There are dashed holes on the edges of each page. Just tear off the page directly. It is a very simple handwork. Practice children cutting graphics and origami. My son is 3 and a half years old. He really likes to do it, but he doesn't use scissors very well, so he just practiced. Some things are very ""practical"", like sun hats, which can just fit on the son's head, and slippers, he can just ""wear"", the son himself said ""the size is right"", ha ha. There is a lot of fun while letting him practice handwork. I really like it. "
0	1 It is very hot, and it burns your hands in less than an hour. Dell’s early 3000 notebooks have not been so hot in a day. I am a little scared. 2 The machine feels very thin and the plastic feels very strong. 3 The battery life is not ideal. 4 The drive is vista, xP. Find it yourself, it's a bit troublesome 
0	The hotel has a good location, 3 minutes away from Jiefangbei, with spacious rooms. Breakfast is ok, dessert is delicious. But the lobby is too small, there are few elevators, there are many guests, and it is mixed with office buildings, which is very inconvenient. From the room decoration, it is indeed a business hotel, but Ctrip says it is a four-star standard. In fact, it is difficult to reach the four-star standard. The biggest problem with this hotel is that it did not prepare free tea bags for guests. There is a small bucket of tea next to the tea cup, which can easily be mistaken for free. I was charged 11 yuan when I checked out. The waiter's explanation is that if you want free tea bags, the hotel can provide them separately, which is far-fetched. 
0	1. There is no status indicator on the telephone line and network card interface; 2. There is no manual shutdown switch for the network cable, network card and speaker (you must use the Fn emergency key combination) 
0	The biggest shortcoming is the C drive space. I used the tools that came with the system to divide the area once, and only divided 100G of space. As a result, I couldn't enter the system, and I could only use the recovery disk to restore the factory settings. There is no additional system installation disk. There is no camera either. 
1	This is a good one in the Qing Chuanwen I have seen. This is the first time that Jiu elder brother is a male lead. This looks better than a woman, and he is also a genius in business. He is already familiar with it. This is the first time I have known such achievements in scientific innovation. Let’s not talk about it, there is a problem: the decline of Chinese medicine is well-known, but the heroine, a student of Chinese medicine school, is more capable than the medical officer in the palace, so I can’t agree. As a medical student, the heroine also learned the history of the Qing Dynasty too well. Regardless of major events, she actually heard his brother's name when she was saving a child. She could think of the person who escorted Jiu elder brother decades later. Di God! 
1	In Sha Tin, the location is not bad, just a bit far from the subway station, the environment is good, the service is good, the check in/check out at the front desk are very fast. The room is not as small as the legendary Hong Kong hotel room , I feel big enough. Ha. Very comfortable. 
0	The location of the hotel is poor and the traffic is extremely inconvenient. The rooms are small, at most three-star standards, and the surrounding environment is poor. After I stayed, I didn’t feel very good. I checked out before 6pm, but the full price was charged, which was really disappointing. 
1	The waiters in the lobby are very warm and feel at home. In addition to a computer, the business room you stay in has a multi-function fax machine, which can copy and send documents in the room, which is very convenient. There will be a fee for using the computer in the room, but the Internet is free and the speed is very fast. The computer engineer was very professional and efficient, and helped me solve some problems in time. The location is excellent, it is very convenient to go to the exhibition center, so you don't have to worry too much about traffic jams. The stay was very pleasant. 
0	Although the nominal frequency of the L7700 processor is 1.80Ghz, HP has dropped to 1.60Ghz...Although 1.6G is completely enough, it is a waste... 1.8 hard drives do require a little patience... 
0	I have already read the book halfway through. It’s really pretty, easy to understand, and worth reading. I’m hesitant to buy the next few copies as a Nanchang native. I have to correct the author. He wrote in the book that someone is looking at Poyang from the Pavilion of King Teng. lake. . . (The book is not at hand, I don’t remember the exact statement.) In fact, what Tengwang Pavilion can see is the Ganjiang River. I hope everyone will not be misled. 
1	The standby time is long, the screen is adjusted to the darkest, the standby time can be up to 9 hours. I bought it for my wife. It is suitable for girls to use white notebooks. White is indeed better than black, and the chocolate keyboard is also good. The power adapter is small enough. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, which is much more pleasing to the eye than using a male model. It has a long standby time, which is very useful for people who travel frequently. 
1	Heqing’s business single rooms can be called luxurious, with particularly advanced facilities, especially the rare advanced toilets, which are rarely available in hotels. The price is acceptable. 
1	I saw from Ctrip.com that everyone spoke highly of the Seaview Garden’s service. We went to Qingdao to escape the summer heat in late July and stayed here specially. Staying for 5 days feels the same, and it really deserves its reputation. It can be said that the service in the hotel we have stayed in is first-rate. There are a few things that touch me in particular. For example, Western restaurant supervisor Wang Jie and waiter Jin Yusheng heard that I had stomach problems. Besides taking care of me during meals, they also brought me some raw peanuts, saying that eating a few a day can protect the gastric mucosa. I love to eat green vegetables, every time I fry a small plate individually. It was raining on the day we arrived in Qingdao. The customer relations officer escorted us directly into the room and checked in in the room. He saw plaster on my feet during registration, and quickly asked the floor attendant to send me some Yunnan white ointments. Later, the blue bar waiter also noticed that I was limping while walking and gave another box of plasters. I basically recovered after posting. I have chronic pharyngitis and cough when I enter the air-conditioned room. The waiter in the lobby immediately fetched me the Golden Throat, and the waiter in the blue bar brought cough syrup again. I see results soon after taking it. The floor attendants always clean up the room after we go out, and the room is always tidy every time we come back, and milk is delivered in the evening. This is a treatment we have never received when traveling abroad. When we walked into the hotel, all the employees we saw smiled and greeted us, which made us feel very kind. I also noticed that the breakfast food provided by the hotel, fruits and small gifts to the room are all of good quality. All this shows that the general manager of the hotel is well-managed and has trained so many employees so well that it is not easy for them to establish the concept of customer first and provide humane service, courtesy, enthusiasm, meticulousness and thoughtfulness. In fact, as a five-star hotel, the hardware of the store is not ideal. but. Their superb service does attract customers. We are still our first choice for the summer vacation next year, and of course the Seaview Garden is our first choice for a hotel in Qingdao. 
0	"I booked this hotel twice and encountered almost the same problems. I wrote very clearly in the remarks, ""Not facing the street, quiet, high-rise, no room type on KTV,"" I don’t know why, but Ctrip didn’t use it. The information was passed to the hotel, but there was still a problem with the hotel's understanding, and it was given to me for the first time "
1	Very quiet and good surroundings. The traffic is more convenient. However, there are not many entertainment facilities or eating places around. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, guests have to check in every time. I just don’t know why every time the front desk makes a mess with you for the smoking and non-smoking areas, even if you have emphasized and confirmed when you book, the front desk will try to change you to a smoking area for smoke-free treatment. Was defeated! 
0	Up to now, I haven't got the book, because your courier can't understand Mandarin, and the parcel doesn't have my address. This poor aunt courier can't find my place and can't deliver it. I don’t speak Shaanxi dialect. I can’t communicate. I can only wait for the aunt to return the goods and then deliver them again. 
0	It took a long time to think of the evaluation, remember that it is super close to the train station, but it will definitely feel noisy while being convenient. Many Korean and Japanese tour groups live here, and the front desk service is cold. Two people live in a standard room, only give a room card, and look at me provocatively. Angry and not in the mood. Hotel feedback July 17, 2008: The hotel has seriously rectified the problems raised by guests. I hope that everyone who stays at Bohai Pearl Hotel will be happy to stay and return with satisfaction. 
1	"This set of books is currently my 5-year-old daughter's favorite, and I am asked to tell her 2 books every day. This set of books uses the method of ""incarnation travel"" to get close to various scientific knowledge. It is really a wonderful idea! It can be seen that the publishing house is also very careful, inviting researchers in related fields to write the preface for each book. The overall content is suitable for children over 4 years old, because the content is still very rich and requires a certain degree of understanding. Children who are too young may not be interested. In short, good books are worthy of everyone. "
1	The Chinese restaurant is definitely not a five-star: I went to the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor after 8pm. There were no people dining. The environment of the restaurant was like a small shop. The tableware was also very ordinary. There were no napkins on the table and no toothpicks. The serving is also slow. 
1	I booked Building 5 of Xiamen Hotel, it was quiet, the room was clean, spacious and comfortable, and the service was very good. The location of the hotel is very convenient. It only costs a starting fee to get to Xiamen University and the ferry. Moreover, the hotel itself is a garden hotel and is also very beautiful. Also, the double breakfasts are also very good. In short, I like the hotel very much and I will definitely stay in Xiamen next time. 
0	There is only 1g of memory, it would be even better if Jingdong sent 1g. Vista system 1g is more unbearable to run. 
0	Mine has no video, it is very troublesome to install XP, of course for me, I also specially invited someone to help me install 
1	"Reading this book carefully, I felt so heavy that I went to look at the movie ""Blue Kite"". It was also about rightists, but the film’s description of the persecution of extinction of humanity was obviously not as detailed, profound, vivid and powerful as this book. . Of course, the feeling given to me is not so unforgettable. This is a rare and good book. Every Chinese person should read it and understand that period of history so that he can remain sober and rational before the next ""revolution."" "
0	Maybe it is because there are too many people who say good things, so the expectations of this book are too high. When I read it in my hand, I feel that the writing is very superficial and uninteresting. I can read it in half a day. 
1	I rarely give full marks to such textbooks. But this book really surprises me a lot! First of all, it not only satisfies your need to memorize words, but also explains the specific usage skills of words and the corresponding grammar. Finally, it also has a corresponding stereo for flexible applications. There is also that it is beautifully printed to an extent. So if you want to pick up English like me, he must be a very good textbook. But if you are a student or are learning English, please use it as a reference book. Always, it is everyone's benefit to get a practical and good book. (me too!) 
0	The hotel is relatively old, close to the airport, and can hear a lot of noise. And the breakfast was very poor, there was nothing to eat. I will never stay in this hotel again. Hotel feedback March 14, 2008: Dear guest, thank you very much for your valuable comments, we apologize for the unpleasant experience you encountered during your stay, the following is our feedback on your comments: 1. Regarding the noise and obsolescence of the hotel you mentioned, as the hotel is located in the west section of Huli Avenue, the main arterial line in Xiamen, a 10-minute drive from the airport, this is the main advantage of the hotel’s convenient transportation. But then comes the noise problem. Xiamen Lianfa Group invested heavily in the renovation of the hotel in May 2007, and made the greatest improvements and enhancements in sound insulation. Since the hotel was renovated and put into use, no complaints from guests about noise have been received. 2. Breakfast: For the team-oriented breakfast in the past few years, the hotel has made great improvements in staffing and breakfast types and quantities. At present, breakfast includes more than 40 side dishes, drinks, hot dishes, pastries, staple food, salads, etc. Grow dishes to meet the different preferences of various customers. We cherish every customer's complaint very much, and cherish every opportunity to provide service to our guests. Maybe the hotel is not perfect yet, but we have been working hard. I hope you can visit Li Xuan Hotel again and feel our changes. Finally, thank you again for your comments and suggestions, because it is because of guests like you that Lixuan has been improving and improving. Thank you! 
1	According to my friend, this hotel has a shabby exterior but a luxurious interior decoration. The service is absolutely good. From getting off the bus, entering the room, and then checking out, there are very professional waiters at the reception. Help me take my luggage, send it to the room, turn on the air conditioner, turn on the lights, and make tea. . . . . . And insist on not tipping! I live in a special big room, which is very good. I will definitely stay here when I go to Fuzhou. Very comfortable, very spacious, free 3 hours domestic long distance, computer free Internet access, and complete games, very fast. 
1	I received it yesterday. The installation of the XP system is also very smooth, and the software test is also very satisfactory. It is good value for money. Except for the drivers of the wireless network card and graphics card, which are downloaded by themselves, they are available on other driver disks. Network card: NE771, just search on Google Yes, the download address of the graphics card is: http://www.drvsky.com/nvidia/NVIDIA_GeForce_9650M_GT.htm 
0	Huidong Hotel: 1. There is basically no difference between business single room and ordinary single room (in terms of room size and supporting facilities). The main difference is the floor. The general arrangement of business is the top few floors. It is recommended that you choose ordinary single room; The lighting is very dim, and it feels a bit depressing; 3. The decoration of the room is relatively poor, it should be the worst in the four-star hotel I have ever stayed in (but no way 
1	The environment is very, very good, courtyard-style villas, although the hotel has been around for a long time, it is said to have existed in 1992, the rooms are slightly small, but the service and environment are excellent, highly recommended, absolutely quiet. The only bad thing is the TV. The earliest 21-inch color TV may have no problem with the room I lived in. The TV cannot be turned on when I enter my friend’s room. Ask the waiter and the waiter will quickly get it done. The sound of digital TV has changed a lot. The sound of this channel is normal. Changing the channel can scare people to death-the European Cup, the sound in the early morning, alas, the one next door... 
1	Ruiji Hongta is the first choice of several old customers of the company. The room facilities are the best among the nearby five-star hotels. The office furniture is very comfortable and the bathroom decoration is very particular. 
1	All conditions are good, but the room and bathroom are small. Clean and tidy, with good sound insulation. 
0	The content is fair, but in terms of literary talent, it's just so-so. It's just some great truths, but it still gives people some enlightenment. But this book is more suitable for girls with ideals 
0	Since the screen is smaller and smaller, it would be better. This is known in advance, but I always feel a little awkward. Fortunately, I didn’t buy a white one for the wide frame, otherwise the big black frame would be ugly. 
1	YTO Express delivery is fast and the service is good. Give it a five-point and buy it at home, and the family is very satisfied. 
1	The room facilities are relatively old, the catering is expensive, the service is good, and there is no view. Looks better than lion forest 
0	"The building is old and the room interiors are average. It is a typical old-fashioned 3-star hotel in the area. The door card often fails. Especially the service has not yet formed the concept of serving guests. When the door card cannot open the door to the front desk to make a card, I just asked the hotel Make an opinion. What is unbelievable is that the service staff at the front desk actually said, ""Who makes you always extend the stay day by day!""-In fact, I just renewed the stay for 3 days the day before. This kind of service attitude is also in N I met in a guest house in a county a year ago. I really can’t comment on a five-star hotel in the provincial capital. The result was a quarrel with the front desk. I moved out of this hotel. The price/performance ratio (price and interior of the room) is far less than that Zhongzhen and Huating. Of course, if there is no requirement for housing prices, the WTO is better. "
0	I thought that the motherboard (chipset AMD RX781 + AMD SB700) of this notebook had integrated graphics. After installing VISTA, I found that there was only one graphics card. Of course, I couldn't talk about hybrid crossfire. This made me feel a bit regretful. 
1	Portable, good performance and reasonable price. The gifts from JD.com are also very useful. All in all very good value. The attitude of the self-promotion staff is also very good. 
0	I am very anxious and don't know how to raise children. I am a kindergarten teacher. Everyone says that I can educate my children well, but education is not a matter of one person and requires the cooperation of my family. In many cases, you can't do it according to your wishes. I gave this book to my family and we discussed how to educate children. This book teaches us a lot. As a parent, I like it very much, as a teacher, I like it better! 
0	I cut the price as soon as I bought it. I just got the item and I said that I ended the order online, but I saw that the price has fallen by 200~ 
0	The introduction to the sample page that I saw is the latter part of the book. The first part is boring and not worth so much money. I was fooled. There are so many English learning materials now. It is really a mistake to spend money on such a book. 
0	I have bought and seen new laptops with screen protectors before, but this time I don’t have them. It’s not repaired or used. Would you please tell me too? 
1	The breakfast is very good, the location is good, take a taxi to the train station to have a dozen people 
0	The mirror design is easy to leave fingerprints, and the price is reduced too fast. From order to receipt, 100 yuan is gone, and the original package is missing. 
1	The white is beautiful, fingerprints are not obvious, the keyboard is comfortable, and the battery is good. . At that time, I was optimistic about the battery, compact size and easy to carry. 
0	I installed a lot of software in one go, and the running speed dropped a bit. If you have enough money, 48 or 49 are recommended. The first time you use Vista, it is not very di, not as convenient as XP, but the screen is more beautiful. 
0	Stayed in so many five-star hotels, this is the first time to experience degrade! ! ! Due to time constraints, I couldn't book a holiday room, so I chose a superior room. I went to the hotel at 11 o'clock in the evening and arranged a double room with a lot of smoke. Because I hate smoking, all requests for silent floors or a room with no smoke, the front desk said to arrange immediately. After that, I waited for an hour... Finally, I couldn't help but call the front desk and found that the phone in the room was broken. Then I got through with my mobile phone and said the request again. After ten minutes, a waiter said to take me to change rooms and then took me to a smaller room. Since there was no smoke, I accepted. Since I am with my girlfriend, the original pillow in the room is not enough. I called the hotel butler and told me that I asked for multiple pillows. At this time, something very depressing happened. The housekeeping department said that since this is a standard single room, all if you want to add pillows, you need to add money! ... ... #^$#@^#$^#@ Super depressed! It turned out that the front desk helped me downgrade the room. The rooms of this level are the lowest level, and all the extra pillows are charged. I rely on! I gave the money to the superior room to help me change to the standard room, and I was very depressed in a moment! I have stayed in countless star-rated hotels, and this is the first time I have experienced downgrade treatment! Then I immediately called the front desk and explained the situation and asked for the assistant manager in the lobby. The front desk said I was sorry, it was too late, please make a complaint early tomorrow. Helpless... immediately call Ctrip to request processing or check out. After ten minutes, Ctrip asked me to change the hotel room. Then I changed to a room equivalent to the original one. It was basically tasteless and I was settled down. Not long after I entered the room, Ctrip's customer service called me apologizing. The attitude is very good and worthy of praise! After staying in this hotel, I feel that Phoenix City in Zengcheng, a suburb of Guangzhou, is really a rural place! It dispelled my originally good interest! In addition, Phoenix is ​​basically full of villas now, and there are almost no tourist attractions. If you really want friends on a weekend vacation, you should consider Conghua, Nankunshan or Zhuhai! 
1	For LP, Samsung has a good appearance, and the speed of the machine is not bad. It takes half an hour to set it up when it is turned on. It is slower and requires a while. In addition, the battery is very good. I bought it without hesitation after seeing the long standby time. 
0	Partitions are mentally retarded. A lot of junk. Startup is slow and dead. There is no recovery CD. There is no recovery. The software downloads. The heat is very large. The left hand basically keeps baking. The touchpad feels worse than THINKPAD’s little red dot. Module 
1	I like this hotel because there is a smile there! Because it is convenient! Because the price is reasonable! And Tsingtao Beer at 56 Dengzhou Road! When I went to Wuhu, I was often unable to order Guoxin because of rush. What a pity! 
1	I now recommend this book to my classmates. He told me that this book is still very valuable. For example, it emphasizes that some of the money is just that we usually don’t pay attention to it or even understand the concept. I am sure this book Books will affect the financial management and life of many people. Tribute to the author of this book 
1	The design is beautiful, the quality is very good, the configuration is very good, the battery display design is very punctual, unlike other manufacturers, it will automatically shut down at 15%. 
0	1. The luxurious furniture in the room is not practical and does not have the warmth of home. 2. I found a mouse crawling at the house in the early morning. I called the front desk and asked to change the room. The front desk asked me to go downstairs and change the room card. Sleeping 3. After being transferred to a low-priced room, the next day, the bill will be settled at the high price, and I will apologize for the pointlessness of the mouse found in the room 4. over 
0	"I bought ""Seeking a doctor is worse than asking myself"" and ""Zhou Ruchang's Proofreading Stone"" and found that the paper quality of the books is quite different from what is sold in the bookstore. "
0	Very general. Work, such as people drinking water, knows the temperature. The advertisement is too high. Why should a newcomer with sound mind and good emotional intelligence waste time reading? Dealing with people and things will gradually be polished with the increase of work experience. It is really your turn. In that place, facing people and things like that, you will choose the action that is most beneficial to you, and you don't have to be taught. Don't like the love inside. The criticism is relatively simple, but it is indeed not recommended. 
0	Except the bathroom is clean, everything else is very dirty, the carpets and towels are not clean. For lunch in the hotel restaurant, I saw the waiter pour the leftovers of the tourists back into the buckets for other guests. It is recommended that self-driving guests do not live in Xikou. Xikou is enough for one day, and the transportation is very convenient. You can live in a larger city nearby. Food, drink, play, and sleep in Xikou are expensive and not affordable. 
0	Because this is a good book that many people say, I just bought it. Maybe it’s the Dongdong written by Yu Hua that completely contradicts my own routines. I think his writing is very bad. I personally feel that he is a little bit I imitated Wang Xiaobo, but the ability to control words is far behind, so I'm so nondescript, I regret buying this book very much. 
1	The sapphire shell is very beautiful, the keyboard is like Sony, high-end, the configuration is not bad, and the price is high. 
0	I have worked in two Fortune 500 multinational companies. Looking through this book, I can roughly restore the author's true character and life state. A soil bun is a soil bun, and this book will never become a white-collar worker on a spiritual level. People who haven't seen foreign companies in the tier cities are probably okay, and they will be completely ignored in Shanghai. 
1	It is a 15-minute walk from Gongbei Pass. It is very convenient. The deluxe standard room in the hotel is too small and the bathroom facilities are a bit old, but the hot water is sufficient. The change to the 07 series room (such as 1607 1107) makes a big difference. I learned from the local travel agency , Through them, the reservation price is 300 yuan, which is different from the 350 yuan price of Ctrip. The breakfast is not enough to eat, but the service is good. We have to leave at 7 in the morning, and the hotel arranges to pack it to the room before the breakfast start time. 
1	The biggest advantage is that the battery standby time is relatively long! The workmanship is very delicate, small and light, and easy to carry! The fan has a very small sound and a relatively complete range of functions, and the speed is relatively fast compared with other netbooks! 
0	It is more troublesome to install the XP driver, ask a colleague to help install it, it took a long time to install it, and the heat dissipation is too large. 
0	The quality is not too light; not upgrading the BIOS version will result in only 1GB of 2GB memory; the touchpad design is not reasonable enough, it is recommended to include a mouse; the integrated graphics card is not enough to cope with most games with high requirements for 3D effects, but it should not be harsh. 
1	Ye Haihua is not a stunning beauty, she uses her heart and affection, works earnestly, loves earnestly, no matter what, for her own heart, not for other miscellaneous things! And Yun Zheng gave her the best love a girl can get , Tolerance, respect, pampering. Without education and transformation, this is the love that can only be found in a book! 
0	I found that there was a bright spot on the upper right corner, but on the very edge, it didn't matter. . . 
1	1. The hotel facilities are relatively old 2. The breakfast is still at a higher level 3. Close to the hospital 4. If possible, you can stay at the InterContinental Hotel next to the same group 
1	The notebook is very beautiful, running Vista is very slow, I haven't changed the system yet, I don't know if the driver is installed. The price is reasonable and the delivery is timely. 
0	I booked the hotel for my friend, and the price was much higher than before. Let alone. The friend checked out the next day, and the front desk asked for a compensation of 110 yuan for dyeing a towel and bed linen. My friend was very unhappy and said it was drinking you The refrigerator coke spews out. And 110 is enough for you to buy 5 sets. In the end, I asked the front desk to find the manager, and a guy said he was. My friend said that you four stars did it a bit too much. Then I asked the guy to take me there Check the room for pollution and to what extent. So he went with him, and I doubted whether a friend had dyed a large piece of the bed sheet. So the moment I pulled off the bed sheet, something surprising happened, below On the cotton slip, there was a woman's blood on her period. Of course, she wanted to vomit. The blood seemed to be recent. My friend became anxious when I saw it. How disgusting it is to sleep in this bed for a night. I believe the hotel is also capable I checked it out, I didn’t change it at all, or simply washed it and put it on. So, please check and check it carefully when you stay at this hotel. (The final solution is half price for the hotel, but it is far from eliminating this disappointment, and I am determined not to stay again ). Additional review on February 3, 2007: If blood stains are found on the bed sheets, this is absolutely intolerable in foreign or even domestic 4,5 star hotels. Hotels are not simply a matter of discounts.

1	At that time, because there was no room in the originally booked standard room, the hotel staff upgraded all 2 rooms to the executive room for free. The front desk staff was very kind. By the way, I strongly recommend you to the revolving cafeteria on the top floor. The environment there is very good. 
1	"""Recommended Books"": Reading such stories will let adults regain their curiosity, learn to enjoy surprises, enjoy reading and the unexpected pleasure of reading, as well as wonderful parent-child time. . . . . . "
1	I bought it for the elderly at home, I haven’t seen it in detail, but I heard from my family that it’s not bad. 3299, T4200, LED screen, camera, not bad 
0	It's not as good as I expected. Maybe this book is more suitable for children under 2 years old. An oversized, overweight, and hardcover book. There is no substance, just a few pages, which is quite expensive. Such a book is not worth reading again, just make a simple package and sell it at a cheap price. 
0	The price of the book changed before it was received, and I found that the price at the place where the book was selected is different from the price on the order. Sometimes the price is high when selected, and sometimes it is low. This time I was a little disappointed in the book purchase. I haven't read the book yet, so I haven't commented on it. 
1	Having read most of the book, I couldn't help but want to write about it. Teacher Wang is really attentive and good at thinking. This is a really good teacher, but there are too few such teachers. If I can meet Teacher Wang when I am in school, I believe that my future will not be what I am now. It seems that those stupid teachers don't know how many generations and how many people were delayed. I hope that more teachers will read Mr. Wang's book and think carefully about how to teach children to learn instead of teaching knowledge, so that children can truly fall in love with learning! 
0	Yu Dan's book I have read this one, and it is the last one. The content is simple, leading to nonsense. I do not recommend everyone. 
1	"I think my baby feels like the title I wrote about this set of books. When I first bought it, I just flipped through it at random. I was still very depressed and thought it was worthless, haha, but recently I clamored to tell Listening to her, I don’t quite understand the secrets of this, but the baby just likes it! But it’s worth mentioning that the color of the mailbox mentioned in the book ""Strawberry Dim Sum"" is red, which seems to be inconsistent with our national conditions. Our country’s mailboxes are all green. I hope we can put more emphasis on the introduction of books. Our lives are practical. "
1	"This book is a book recommended by my marketing teacher in my class during my graduate school at Xiamen University. I admire the old professor’s memory and list many examples of this book at once. I immediately had the desire to buy the book and read it. If you want to have a stronger influence on others, or in other words, you want to persuade others better, then this book is indispensable. ""Influence"" will not only make it easier for you to persuade others, but also make it easier for you to understand and understand the behavior of others. "
1	There was an inexplicable excitement when I first got this book. I can't wait to open it to appreciate it. It is the traditional Chinese version as expected, and I am even more excited. It took about a month to complete it. I feel that this war-torn campus is so beautiful that it is more abundant than the university life I experienced in this peaceful era. As I approached graduation, my friends left one by one. Although I didn't describe it too much, I couldn't help but feel sad. Just a year ago, I experienced the pain of separation from college friends. Only the memory remains in the heart. However, the song still moved me even more. 
0	The service was too inadequate. Originally, we paid 300 for a deposit for one day, but for some reason, we had to stay one more day and did not check out in the morning. I also told the waiter when I went to the lobby to collect the meal ticket, but the waiter did nothing. Say. but when

1	Not bad, just because the bridge is being repaired next to it, the traffic is inconvenient. The service is not bad, the breakfast is plentiful, and the overall 4 star standard. 
0	This configuration is still a bit stuck with Vista. Fingerprint collector. If you don't send the original mouse, you need to buy it yourself, which is not good. 
1	Just like the title of the book, this early work of San Mao is different from the optimistic and strong San Mao that matured in the later period. Instead, it records the experience and mood of San Mao when she was still Er Mao. It was her dreaming and somewhat neurotic when she was young. The epitome of the sad rainy season. Perhaps the achievement is not very high, but friends who like Sanmao can see how the woman who fascinated them grew up. Readers at that stage of life may resonate and discover that their thinking at this time is not alone, and no one understands it. 
0	There was a problem with the delivery. It was said that it was delivered that afternoon, but I couldn't make it through after asking. It was originally a birthday present, and it was delayed. 
1	The first time I saw this book in a bookstore, I couldn't put it down as soon as I picked it up, but I stood there until I finished reading it. When I read it, I was very involved, and I didn't even feel the sore feet until I closed the book. After reading this book, some confusions in life gradually disappeared, and I rethink how to make the short life more fulfilling and happier. Suddenly there was hope in my heart. Of course, the book is also different from person to person. Some people will love this book, such as myself. Some people think that these truths are so simple that they have long understood. However, sometimes the simpler things are easier to forget, and the more they need to be reminded. 
1	Overall it is decent. When we checked in, the room hadn't been cleaned, and we responded to the hotel staff and dealt with it immediately. The facilities in the room should only be enough for three stars! Hotel feedback July 27, 2007: It is the peak season and the hotel’s occupancy rate is relatively high, so the above situation has occurred. We apologize for this. At present, the hotel has formulated a series of related measures to ensure that the guests can check in in the early morning in the peak season. We are very grateful for your valuable comments and hope that you can stay at our hotel again next time. 
1	It can be used for an hour and a half in a low battery state. This machine is too strong and looks very good. It is worth 2899 to catch up with the promotion. 
1	"I like this set of books very much, two, including ""Xian Qing Ou Ji"" and ""Random Talk"". Put it next to the pillow and flip it over. Not only the content, but when I look at it, I feel like I am living in it. Every time I look at it, I will find different little details. For example, A Qiao was caught in a big jar. I only found it the third time I saw it. I laughed for a long time. My husband told me that next time he is not allowed to buy comic books, he must be pulled into the water if he has the opportunity to take a good look. If he refuses to publish this kind of comics, I have to learn. "
0	It's better not to go, the decoration is noisy, and it is more chaotic than the bus station and train station. 
1	I have always liked Manman's books very much. In her books, I can always feel the real world. Maybe I am also a woman with a touch of sadness in my heart! Many times, there is nothing left, but there is still friendship, which is also a kind of touching and a kind of dependence! I like Han Tong with personality very much. I like her indifferent attitude and indifferent attitude. I hope that one day I can be like her. Live your life calmly. 
1	"Needless to say it looks good, the text is fluent, and it is very comfortable to read. As long as there is no chores, you can read it all at once without getting tired. It's easy to use because it is useful to read history. The author spent a lot of effort on data collection and material sorting, some seemingly insignificant figures, in fact, spent a lot of effort. Despite this, the author did not lose his book bag, so it was natural that he came in like this. The author has the potential to become a ""popular"" historian, hoping to maintain his standard and not ask for the number of books. "
1	In the past, most of the books I read for my 5-year-old daughter were specifically written for children. This time, Robinson Crusoe gave her a whole new experience. My daughter likes it very much, and she pesters me to tell her every day, and she looks happily at this set of other notebooks (not told to her yet) looking forward to it. I don’t know if my daughter will like the other basic books in this set, but Robinson Crusoe is really good, the printing quality is good, the graphics are clear, the colors of the pictures are pleasing to the eye, and the proportions of the pictures and the text are appropriate. A very good book. 
0	"I bought this book for Bi Shumin's fame and for the slightly mysterious and mysterious words ""woman"" and ""psychologist"". What happened? First of all, the writing style is still very good, which is praiseworthy. But there is no innovation in the technique, and there is nothing new in applying the fashionable mode of writing in recent years! The most disgusting thing is that in the introduction, the words of the patients were written vaguely, and the titles on the catalog that were not directly related to the subject of each chapter. Grandstand! In terms of characters, the personalities are not prominent. Especially the highest authority in the psychology field, how powerful it has a background, but there is no personality in the dialogue, and it is not necessarily so advanced. It is simply a layman. Women’s psychological life experience is too vulgar, and even the big S’s serial dramas have similar plots. There are also gaps in her personality development, especially from nursing homes to going to psychology, the transition is far-fetched. The other characters have no impression after reading. Everyone feels it is not worth wasting time! "
0	The price/performance ratio of this (silver ribbon) is lower than the one I ordered. The order was originally placed, but it was found to be out of stock after payment. I had no choice but to add 300 yuan to get this 
1	The service attitude is relatively good, willing to listen to the opinions of customers, the room facilities of 290 yuan are ok, the room space is a little smaller, the breakfast is relatively average, logically 4 stars should be better, and other 4 stars have also been stayed. 
1	The best hotel I can find in Jilin City. The speed of check-in and check-out is okay. The room is in good condition, the bed is not as comfortable as in Changchun, and it feels harder. 
0	The room is great, poor service, poor attitude, poor room facilities~~I will never go again. Just one word 
1	Cost-effective, no bright spots, good packaging, and very fast, the order placed at night will arrive at noon on the third day. 
1	Childhood memories are the best thing, I will regret if I miss it. Looking at the books, some were intoxicated. The translation is in Mandarin, I always feel awkward, not as good as Cantonese translation. But I have to say that the quality is very good. Each book is well packaged and the gift box is also very good. There are three stickers and two bookmarks. The inner and outer packaging has not been damaged. It seems that it is a genuine book. I have to say that the deliveryman is very careful, and I want to thank him here. I have also watched the animation, in Cantonese or Japanese, but I want to own this set of precious books. 
0	I can be lighter, and I can send some accessories. If you buy a notebook, you have to match a lot of small accessories. Choosing things is very troublesome. 
1	"Although the title of the book is ""A good mother is better than a good teacher"", it actually has educational significance for dad. The theory and practice in the book explain how to guide your children correctly through the little things in life, and cultivate children to build a good character from an early age. From the book, we can see that many of the ways to educate children that we have often seen in life in the past are not the best, and some are still wrong, which will invisibly set a bad example or inconsistent guidance for children. I personally think that this book can help moms and dads determine the right direction for educating their children. It is also of educational significance for moms and dads. I recommend you to read it. "
0	1. The breakfast is very poor. 2. The service attitude is very poor. 3. The location is not good. There is nothing to eat around. Overall, it's very poor. I checked in on April 28, 2008. 
0	Because my two-and-a-half-year-old son likes cars very much, after seeing everyone's comments, he bought two sets and a series of books. The first feeling I got in my hand was light and light. Although the format of the book was large, the paper was average. It is too far from its price. I opened the book and turned it around, because I bought it for this book at the time, and it was as messy and too messy as many buyers commented before. The picture is too full and the plot is not clear. The most important thing is that many cars are completely inconsistent with ours in China, such as: taxis, jeeps, and my son’s favorite pickup trucks. There is no translation in them, and they are mostly translated into small trucks or transport vehicles. It's rather confusing for him, and I'm struggling to talk about it. Maybe my child is too young for this set of books. In short, this series of books is not worth buying, and the price/performance ratio is too low. 
1	My daughter is more than 3 years old and she doesn't look like a girl at all. Has always been famous for being naughty and active. The people in the family are strict with her, but it seems that the effect is not very good. I paid attention to this book very early. I bought it this time and read it carefully. It is really a good book. I am trying to use the methods in the book to communicate with my daughter, and I feel that it has had a certain effect. Now I only read half of the book, and when I finish reading it all, I think there will be more gains. I strongly recommend you young parents to read this book, there will be many gains. 
0	The location is not as central as Ctrip said. It is about 6-7 minutes drive from Tianhe Shopping Center. If you walk, you can avoid it. Hotel facilities and decoration are very general, up to a three-star standard. Will never choose this place to live again. 
1	The biggest advantage of this book lies in its simplicity and practicality. There is no preaching or principle in the book, but it teaches us a lot of communication skills with children, plus some exercises. It is indeed very useful for our education and training of children. Great help. I think if you follow the instructions in it, even if it cannot be said to be 100% effective, it will definitely improve the relationship with the child. It's a pity that I still can't practice many techniques. The two-and-a-half-year-old child is still at the stage of making trouble, but I will be able to use these methods soon, so I must learn now, ha ha ha. 
0	I am very angry about this hotel! I checked in the day before yesterday and the front desk clerk warmly told me that as long as I sign an agreement, the hotel can give me a lower price than Ctrip! The hotel's facilities are extremely messy, and there is no waiter, the room carpet is disgusting, and the walls are full of imprints of dead mosquitoes. The most frightening thing was that there was a power outage at noon yesterday. Later, I heard that it was a fire in the hotel. It was very serious. All the power equipment (including the Internet and telephone) was shut down. After that, the hotel was in a mess. I heard that the call will be called in the afternoon two days as soon as possible. , All the guests checked out hurriedly. As the credit card pre-authorization was used at check-in, the result was that the electricity could not be used, and only cash was used to check out (four-star hotels did not have two circuits!). The waiter said that after the call, he would send a fax to the bank immediately, and the account would arrive in 3 days, and promised Call me immediately after faxing. As a result, I asked the hotel by phone at three o'clock this afternoon, saying that I would call this morning, but I hadn’t sent a fax yet (forgot). The hotel said it would send a fax immediately, and definitely said it will arrive in 3 days. After that, I called the bank at four o’clock and said that I had just received the fax, but clearly told me that it would take 19 days for the account to arrive (due to the procedure)! For this hotel, I can only score 1 point! 
1	The computer is good, a little business atmosphere! The computer is good, a little business atmosphere! The computer is good, a little business atmosphere! The computer is good, a little business atmosphere! 
1	"To read Tao Lao is to read education! What he held high: ""Life is education"" made me more educated, let me feel what education is, and opened up my horizons, let me take the previous education from books, only books to life is an extension of education! Let me read his mind, and opened my heart. What a great book! "
0	I bought it at 6199. Compared with other netizens, it didn't catch up with the special price of 5850. It was expensive, and I didn't even send a VISTA or driver CD. The machine is heavier than expected. I don't have 5000-200 Jingdong coupons. 
0	In fact, I was also a member of the official website who has read articles and waited impatiently. At that time, it was quite Ji Nan. After the exam, I hurriedly ordered a book on Dangdang.com. Seeing it in the middle of the night, I just want to say, I rely on. . . At the end of the story, I only feel bored, and feel that they are just a couple of people who have nothing to do. Sometimes the hero is very confused, and everyone has become accustomed to the virtue of the man in the small words. But the heroine, alas, it's unbearable to look back. It's enough to be on the throne of the most hated heroine in my works. . The text is not as exquisite as before, and there is no focus on sensationalism. The only thing I moved was the little girl who had a crush on Ji Nan. She proved from the side that Ji Nanfang is not a bastard, but at the same time, she reminded me of a good period like a dream 1. It was just a year or two ago. At that time, I was sincerely moved. Of course, some details in the article are good. But the details cannot frame a whole story. I can only say that I was quite disappointed. Now only the short stories of the I Love the Underworld series can be seen. 
1	Dual-core independent display LED screen DVD burner HDMI output with invoice, what else can I choose at this price, I went to Computer City to check before I bought it, I think 16:9 is a bit uncomfortable, but I still bought it. . . After receiving it, I found that there is nothing wrong with it. It may be because there is no comparison. It is completely acceptable. . . If you think it’s small, you can take a look at the 10-inch book, which is used by people. . . How could this 14 not work. . Haha I received a perfect screen with a large viewing angle 
0	"The only compliment of this hotel is a lady in the sales department, but I'm sorry, I forgot her name. Comments: 1) The value for money is definitely not worth it, there are many similar hotels nearby, and the value for money is better than this 2) except for the above Except for the lady in the sales department mentioned, the other staff are very poor. The front desk is completely like a guest house, and it is the impression of a state-run guest house (check in is midnight, and the front desk wears a military coat and looks like sleepy eyes. The same standard for acting movies) 3) This hotel is a ten-minute walk from the train station. I didn’t find it after four phone calls. When I finally found it, I found out that this is the only hotel in the surroundings that has no colored lights at night, black lights The blind guys really couldn't find them, and the people who answered the phone and instructed had no geographical concept. 4) When checking in, the first sentence said at the front desk was ""There is no order for you"", and the second sentence is ""Definitely there is no order for you""-I only asked what my name was before, just like a criminal. When I called Ctrip to confirm, I suddenly said ""found it"", alas! The room has been changed four times in a row, and I no longer know what to do at the front desk. After a while, cross out the room number and change it to another one, and then change it back again. . . . . . 5) The most terrible thing is that the quiet room is not arranged according to the requirements specified in the previous order. This is completely inconsistent with Ctrip's previous text messages and phone calls. 6) There were a lot of complaints, and I didn't receive a response from the lady in the sales department until I left on the third day (if not because of a lot of things, I would leave the next morning)-a fruit plate was sent, alas! 7) Don't expect anything for breakfast. The content is thin. Most of the main dishes are gone by 8:30. There are few hot things and the response to service requests is always slow. Ugh! Not recommended to stay. Nanchang really has too many choices. But regarding service, objectively speaking, Nanchang's overall service awareness is indeed not high, but this one is really bad.

0	The capacity of the battery is small, and it can be used up to about 2 hours. The integrated graphics card is slightly weaker. 
1	This book was recommended by the teacher (I am an English major). I wanted to buy it a long time ago, but I haven't found a chance. Now I finally got it! Let me talk about the quality of the book first, it is very good, there are no defects, the quality of the attached CD is also very good, there is no damage, etc. I am very satisfied. Second, the content of the book. Both English and Chinese translation are very practical. Whether it is to use it to expand the learning of English, or to read Chinese to increase the knowledge, it is a very good choice. Especially the CD recording, part of it is real-time recording at that time, which is really good! I like this book very much, the price is worth it! 
0	The configuration is general, and the price of the same configuration computer is much lower. The material is plastic, it will be deformed when pressed by hand. . . accurate 
0	The delivery service is really bad. My address belongs to Xuhui District, but they don’t deliver the goods to Xuhui District. They have to deliver the goods in Minhang District. It takes 2 days to go back and forth. What's the matter? 
0	Yushan Hotel's service is very poor, it is bad that I have never seen. The counter moves slowly, the attitude is fierce, the face is stinky, the room is cold and damp without air conditioning, and the restaurant is even worse. It may be government-owned, don't care. 
0	4. Drivers are difficult to find: This is a consistent problem with ThinkPad and Lenovo. The two combined are very, very difficult. There are problems with the drivers provided by Lenovo. I have to find a universal wireless and universal Ethernet card driver from intel. It is done manually and it takes a long time 
1	Stayed once and it was OK. But Ctrip’s rooms are always bad 
1	The environment is pretty good, and the staff are more enthusiastic. At night, the security patrol found that the windows were not closed and called us to remind us, like it! Breakfast is slightly average! Emei specialty snacks are at the door of the hotel! Very close to the tourist station, convenient route! Although the room facilities are not up to the four-star standard, they are not bad in the scenic area. Can recommend! 
0	"It feels like a liberal arts student reading a textbook of ""Advanced Mathematics"". The running account is average, but the background is very good. I chose to write such an inspiring story in such an era of fierce competition, and the writing is not good. "
0	1. The double room is actually a very small room; 2. The newly decorated room is actually not new at all, it looks quite old. Additional review May 23, 2008: I stayed in a newly renovated deluxe room 
0	The carpet in the room is too dirty, it is very noisy near the train station, but fortunately it is double-glazed. The service is average. The TAXI at the entrance of the hotel is a long-term cooperative relationship of the hotel, and monthly fees must be paid to the hotel. From the hotel to the airport, it costs 147 yuan to pay the meter, and then it has to be 200 yuan. You may be slaughtered 30-40 yuan. 
1	Thank you very much for the hotel arranged by Ctrip. We are satisfied with the hotel's service. We hope that Ctrip's service will get better and better and provide better and more comprehensive services for Ctrip's VIP guests. 
1	The room is clean, good value for money, the price is reasonable, not bad 
0	"The first time I came to Dangdang to buy a book, I chose this book because of its sales and customer reviews. To be honest, this book doesn't have much readability. My son is only interested in the storytelling book. Maybe it's an age deviation. My son is four years old. The main title of this book, ""Busy Town"", is really not very attractive~~ "
1	The machine is compact, easy to carry, long time to use, beautiful in appearance, fast in picking up goods, and JD.com's service is getting better and better! The main thing is no problem at all, it is a new machine, it is really good and cheap, and I trust JD. 
1	In fact, every parent does not want to divorce. Who wants to be unhappy or unhappy, and who wants to bear heavy responsibilities! And behind every failed marriage is inner loneliness and rogue. What we have to learn is tolerance and patience. I also face such difficulties. In the face of many injuries, I have learned to be tolerant and patient. This does not mean that I am compromised or cowardly, but I know what I need in marriage. Didn’t the hero in this book grow up like this? His responsibility, tolerance and patience gave him a happy ending, although in reality it is not always so satisfying. 
0	"Some examples are not typical enough, and they may be used to fill the number. I hope to see some less naive and obvious Chinglish (in general, people who have studied English a little will not make the low-level mistakes mentioned in the book), and should write some Similar to the ""jokes"" caused by cultural differences, such as blue stories, most people only know that blue means sadness, but in fact it has become the meaning of pornographic novels. In terms of typesetting, the book still has some merits, it looks relaxed, and some are still more funny. "
1	Excellent value for money, this time we booked three rooms. I feel that the service in the Midwest is sometimes much better than in the developed regions. Hotel Feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for your stay and look forward to your visit again. 
1	I like Pig Peach’s picture book, I like that cute pig~ This book is about the things of Pig Peach when I was a child~ It’s very warm and familiar. These things happened more or less in our past, reading the book The words and paintings of the book remind me of the funny stories when I was a kid~Although our childhood has passed, the memories will not disappear~The design in the book is very clever, and some of the text uses a grid, which reminds me I write with one stroke of the pen, and I don't want to use the quick pen to replace the seriousness of the time. I really want to be a kid~ This book is worth reading for each of us~^_^ 
0	I think the book itself is not as interesting and easy to remember as advertised, but such a vocabulary book is good for expanding the number of words, although it has no grammar and no word meaning expansion. Generally so-so 
1	This is the second time I have stayed at the YMCA. The main reason is that the service attitude is good, the room environment is good, and the surrounding traffic is more convenient.. This time the hotel arranged for us to newly renovated rooms, and the facilities and environment are more complete and better. Next time I will choose the YMCA. 
0	The vista system is not used to learning. I feel that some of the keys on the keyboard are looser when you touch it lightly. It may be too picky. If you listen carefully, you can hear the noise from the radiator but you can tolerate it. The mouse is too bad. 
0	The room is dilapidated, the TV cannot be watched normally, the bathroom is not even prepared with toilet paper, and you have to bring your own. The air conditioner doesn't have a remote control, it's just a furnishing. You have to wear clothes to sleep at night. Service quality is poor! 
1	It was not bad this time, but the flowers in the room were too out of style. 
1	"I think this book is very good. I recommended it to my friends, and my friends liked it very much. I ordered the ""Kingdom of Chinese Characters"" by Lin Xili from Sweden again from Dangdang. One is a friend's book and the other is read by myself. It is very good. "
1	It has a long standby time, which is called 9.5 hours. I bought it for this purpose. I originally planned to buy MSI, which is nearly 500 cheaper than it. This CPU is 280, a bit higher than the 270 frequency. 
1	A good choice, although it is almost full of pictures, and the content is relatively shallow. But it can cultivate children's observation \ self-reading ability very well, the pictures are exquisite, although there are not many words, the contents of the pictures can be rich. Reading with my son, it seems that I have also returned to a time like him. Now the children in the city are already in contact with the supermarket. There are few opportunities to go to the small town to go to the market like the book. The scenes are shown to the children one by one, let them experience and understand the life of the previous generation. Let parents resonate. 
0	This restaurant is really average and it doesn't feel good. The attitude of the service staff was not very good, and the water from the faucet in the room was also yellow for a long time. Won't go again next time 
1	In a few days, I still choose to stay in this hotel. 
0	It’s too much trouble to install XP. I changed N disks, but it still doesn’t work. Finally, in everyone’s evaluation, I saw someone saying that I used a CD to enter WIN ME and then GHOST installed. I tried it and it worked. It took 6 hours to get the XP sound effects. Not good. The fever is quite big 
1	I am a sophomore, in the confusion period of university. The people around me, especially the senior brothers and sisters and their family members, always instill their cognition more or less. It is difficult to be clear about the way out of university. I have been looking for my own beacon, and I happened to find this book by New Oriental, which really feels like a treasure. This book criticizes many traditional concepts. It is suitable for both university and working people. Even high school students who have not entered university are also worth reading. I also recommend this book to others, and I hope it can help. you! 
1	I have bought many copies of this book one after another. I used to just pick the one I like to buy, but now I gradually want to buy them all. After reading a lot of books, I feel a bit like the Chinese version of cat and mouse. That wolf is as cute and ridiculous as that stupid cat. He always makes the mouse play tricks around. The same is true for this wolf. In addition to being stupid, it is real. Very cute, so cute that people feel like wolves can be cute too. Unfortunately, there are no bookmarks in this book. I bought them before. It's a beautiful card. I don't know why? 
1	Nice environment, room facilities are very good, very high-grade, next time I will consider staying 
1	The understanding of drugs, everyone only thinks it is terrible, but the harm to society and the family, after the anti-drug day propaganda, people have forgotten it, especially young people have a strong curiosity, want to try everything, find it novel and fun Many crimes are the result of ignorance. With a strong sense of social responsibility, Bi Shumin told people through the real experience of drug rehabilitation hospitals that drugs, the nemesis of mankind, should never run into it. Human will is a paper kite, as long as it is tied with a black thread of drugs, you will be lost in the storm. It is very educational to let the growing young people read and feel. 
0	Piano paint, the whole fingerprint collector. Heavier than expected. With the two USB ports on the right, my wireless mouse’s transceiver is difficult to plug and unplug, but it’s smooth on the left. It is estimated that the two on the right are too tight. 
0	The hotel is quite economically minded, and the hearty service of airport pick-up makes people unguardedly plunge into the car rental tour team. Later fellow travellers have to learn from experience, and bargain when it is time to bargain. You must not be soft-hearted, otherwise you will change your distressed money in the future! 
0	LINUX system, XP is not easy to install, and the external TV has crashes, maybe I can't get it. In addition, there are many kinds of configurations, and I don’t know which driver to choose when installing the system... 
1	Only stayed for one day in a single room, and I feel satisfied. The service is good, the breakfast is good, and the checkout is fast. I went to Xiguan, a family house not far away, for dinner, donkey meat pot, cheap and affordable. The room is a bit smaller, and the desk is a bit crowded with computers. 
1	Not bad, it's easy to use. It's just that VISTA is a bit slower. I thought that the tedious installation program was also omitted, and it can be used after booting. It also has practical software such as Fetion pre-installed very intimately. 
0	Objectively speaking, not very good hotel. I stayed on January 11th. The weather was extremely cold. The air conditioner in the room didn't work at all. I stayed in the room for 4 hours with cold hands and feet. Finally, I couldn't call to complain. The most annoying thing is that I have never heard of any hotel that needs to be changed or cancelled. You must contact before 15:00. If you don’t contact, you will deduct money from your credit card. I booked 2 rooms and 3 breakfasts. Due to the weather in Qingdao, my friend did not make it. I cancelled a room and 2 breakfasts at 4:30 in the afternoon, but I was charged for 2 breakfasts at checkout. . I already notified Ctrip in the afternoon, and Ctrip also responded that I notified the hotel. But the front desk of the hotel just doesn't admit to receiving the notification. I don't care about the 60 yuan, because I don't think the attitude is really understandable. But the attitude of the hotel driver is very good. I am grateful to the hotel driver and the concierge staff. Anyway, I will not stay here anymore. There are many good hotels in Qingdao. I myself regret why I chose this place. The location is not good, far from the sea, just go to the supermarket to be closer. 
1	When I got the room, there was no big bed room. We were upgraded to a suite for free, which is quite satisfactory. The hotel is generally good, with five-star domestic standards. A little worse than international brands. The hotel is a bit old, and the maintenance needs to be strengthened. For example, the water in our bathroom is blocked. These should be found to be repaired before the guests move in. Everything else is ok. 
0	Lack of random help files, each hardware interface can only be guessed. The pre-installed software in the machine is rather messy, and no explanation is found. 
0	The hotel is not decorated at all and there is a musty smell in the room. Charged broadband, some rooms do not have it. The dining room is one arc. There is no recommendation. It is strongly recommended that you do not live here in the future. 
1	The location is good, the price is right, the environment is good, and the rooms are relatively clean. It is already very good in a place like Shijiazhuang. Next time I have the opportunity to book this hotel. 
1	The heat dissipation is good, and there is no problem in getting it in one day. There is no noise from the optical drive, and the screen is also a perfect screen. Much better than the books of the Acer brand. 
1	The hotel is located at the most lively Dongjiekou in Fuzhou. It is very convenient to eat, shop and go shopping. The business single room is spacious enough and equipped with LCD computer, which is very convenient. Especially worth mentioning is the hotel's service, which is great! Every night, there are small snacks sent by the waiter on the floor, warm reminders of tomorrow’s weather, and newspapers of the day. It feels very intimate. I will choose this one next time I come to Fuzhou. It’s worth it even for such a caring service. 
1	Very nice hotel. Although there is a certain distance from the subway station, it is quite convenient. The bed in the room is big and comfortable. But relatively, other spaces have shrunk. . . But I still like the bed. . . In the morning the waiter’s voice is a bit loud, I hope it can be improved 
0	It can be said to be a relatively poor hotel. The corridors of the hotel are dim, and there is a strong musty smell in the corridors and rooms. The sheets are not very clean to the touch. The bathroom smells even worse, and the facilities inside are also moldy. The most annoying is the sound of KTV music downstairs at night, making it difficult to fall asleep. 
1	This book and its author had been seen in another comic introduction book written by an American, and they have been eager to buy it. Now it is fulfilled. The author is able to develop such an imaginary world of comics from his own special perspective of ABC, which crosses the cultural gap, and makes east meets west present completely different qualities from Chinese comics or American comics, which is very rare. As far as the comic itself is concerned, the lines are smooth and the comic image is round and full, which is a style I like very much. In addition, the text in both Chinese and English is very helpful for learning American contemporary English. stand by ! 
1	This is the fifth time to stay for VIP customers, it is highly recommended! Service is nothing! 
0	The product has been received! I simply turned it over and only read the first few books. I feel that the words are too few and there is no plot. I don’t know how the next few books are. In short, I don’t feel too ideal. My child is one year old and seven months old. Not as good as baby pictorial 
0	Maybe it's because my English is not good, or for other reasons. Anyway, it's not as good as I imagined. Hey...there is still a long way to learn English! 
1	"It can only be said that the painting is good. I bought the two books ""My Dad"" and ""I Like Books"" together. The content of these three books is the same pattern, and it doesn't feel very good. And the two-and-a-half-year-old kid didn't understand why his father became a chimpanzee again, and why he became a singer again. So when parents tell their children this book, they can’t follow the words in the book. It’s best to look at the picture and talk. For example, when you become a singer, you can say: ""Daddy sings well, like a singer. The same sing well. I hope the three instincts can be different. But the words in the book still touch me. "
0	There is a small protrusion on the touch screen, which cannot be removed. The hard disk partition is 225G+1G+10G, which is simply funny 
1	The room was upgraded to an executive floor. The room was large and comfortable. The large floor-to-ceiling windows thought it would be far away, but if you take the KCRC, it is really convenient to reach. Surprisingly, Hong Kong still has such a big room! 
0	It is really unacceptable that the hard disk is divided into 1 zone. Random 1G memory on vista is very difficult, after adding 2G quickly. Cannot partition under Vista, the partition software is not compatible, there is no way to change back to XP. 
0	The pre-installed vista is indeed very difficult to use, causing a lot of trouble, the bios default hard disk mode is also very embarrassing, bad ones will be returned for repair 
1	At first, I didn't report much hope for the CPU, but after installing XP, I found that it can still meet the general needs. There is no problem with watching the film and processing the documents. The game does not know if it can adapt. The appearance is very good, the keyboard is comfortable, not too small. The hard disk is large and affordable. Compared with the mainstream configuration of the same grade 160G, it is more cost-effective. 
1	1. This configuration is right. Starting at this price, Jingdong’s activities are very good 2. Delivery is still OK, now I am engaged in activities, and I can get it 3 days after placing the order. Jingdong delivery has improved 3. Computer speed is very good Fast, the switch is fast, and it’s no problem to run VISTA 
0	The towels and other things are too old, and there are no small squares, and no bottled water. These small places do not tell that they are four stars. The only advantage is that they are close to the river. 
1	The noise is really small and almost inaudible. The optical drive is great. You can read the flower discs from a few years ago. 
0	"Checking in on September 9th, you can see from small things: the shower curtain is 200mm higher than the bathtub, which makes the toilet water on the floor and loses its function. It is better to say that it is a fig leaf; the restaurant tablecloth is stained with oil, and the waiter always answered with confidence, last night Forgot to change. What is incredible is that the room cannot make international calls! At 23:00 on the 11th, I want to make an international long distance call. The front desk first stated that it was not working well. It is recommended to buy an IC card for the call (you want to make money?). At my insistence, the international long-distance call was opened, but after dialing, a Chinese prompt came out: This number is empty... Obviously there is no ""going abroad"". According to the theory of the front desk, looking for the manager on duty didn't solve the problem, but I found an IP card, tried to dial 17900, but couldn't make the call, and tried to dial 10060 (the hotel called Netcom's phone), but couldn't make the call. Finally, I dialed the international long distance with my mobile phone. I have been on the phone, but I can’t fall asleep for a long time. It’s not my heartache that the phone bill is too high. It's the horror in my heart. In case of fire or theft in the night, can I dial 119 or 110? Lovely authentic three-star hotel! Look up at the calendar, ah! September 11th-horrible 911! ! ! Check out early the next day and leave. Leave Ctrip for long-term cooperation with you. "
1	1. Perfect screen, no dead pixels; 2. Excellent sound effect; 3. Beautiful appearance and face; 4. Good heat dissipation, plus the heat dissipation frame of Kyushu Fengshen N15, which is good; 5. Install XP and run Fast; 6. The interface is rich, beyond imagination, even the rare infrared interface; 7. There is nothing to say, I hope Lenovo can stand up for the Chinese people and not disappoint everyone’s expectations and support 
0	It's so damp, it's not human at all! The price is not high, but Ctrip is not competitive! 
0	Very old facilities, poor service, it feels average. Can't compare with big cities. 
0	The room is fairly clean, but the air in the room is not good, and there is a musty smell from the air conditioner; the facilities are very general, the shower faucet is turned for a long time and I don’t know which one is cold water or which is hot water, and it almost turned off in the end. No, it is estimated that the hot and cold water faucets are probably installed back; the restaurant service is very average, the breakfast quality is extremely average, and the restaurant is like a canteen in a large unit. 
0	I have already read the book halfway through. It’s really pretty, easy to understand, and worth reading. I’m hesitant to buy the next few copies as a Nanchang native. I have to correct the author. He wrote in the book that someone is looking at Poyang from the Pavilion of King Teng. lake. . . (The book is not at hand, I don’t remember the exact statement.) In fact, what Tengwang Pavilion can see is the Ganjiang River. I hope everyone will not be misled. 
1	After three days, the system was replaced with XP and it worked well, the heat dissipation was good, and the hard disk was good. There is a little card to run Need for Speed 12. Sound is very good 
0	"The 31st waiter deliberately cheated! ! We went back to the hotel at 12 o'clock to prepare for dinner and cleaned up and settled the bill. The waiter on the 31st asked us when to leave, and we said immediately. As usual, the waiter did not remind us to charge overtime, so we thought that there was no charge. So we didn't rush to eat and clean up... When we checked out at two o'clock, we actually charged for a long time! ! No notification, no reminder, no words about the charge, and the deposit will be deducted from the deposit directly after the invoice is issued. What is this not deliberately cheating? ? ? What's more ridiculous is that the 501 we lived in was a suite. When we first went in, we didn't find the remote control of the TV, so we called the front desk and sent an aunt to see it. The aunt walked in the door and said: ""It seems that 501 has no remote control."" After that, we found the remote control on the TV. Such a waiter and such a service really make Dunhuang dark! ! The breakfast is also ridiculous, at 8 o'clock, the porridge is cold... Alas, this hotel, I can’t go! ! "
1	I also added that parents should watch with children and guide children to think of more wonderful things.This is the main thing. Parents should extend the methods taught in the book, and hope that children can give full play to their rich imagination. Let them think more, use their brains more 
0	Very average facilities, very old. Service is also very average, price and facilities are completely unrelated to a hotel. Will not consider staying again. 
0	I really don’t know why the book has been ranked high. This is the history book I have read. The writing level and grammar are the worst! ! ! Can't comment on bad ones. Novels are not like novels, biographies are not like biography, prose is not like prose, official history is not like official history, and joking is not like joking.....I want to learn Yi Zhongtian, but not like gods, but I want to learn Guo Degang. I lack a sense of humor... It's all because the author is inferior to middle school students, and the seemingly gorgeous words are constantly being piled up...I wonder if other readers feel the same? 
1	The whole machine looks very exquisite in workmanship and beautiful in appearance. The led cold light screen feels more comfortable, and the graphics card is very good. After adding 2G memory, Live 2009 runs perfectly under the highest quality, and it is extremely smooth. The LCD screen wipes that come with it are very considerate, worthy of being produced by a major manufacturer. In addition, the heat dissipation is also very good, not as bad as the legend, it seems that you need to experience it before you know it. The mouse with is Logitech, feels very good. 
0	3. Appearance and size: First of all, the 16:9 screen ratio is really uncomfortable at first glance, but it can control the volume very well, and it does not feel like a silly and big 16:10 in the past. The appearance is much better than the picture. The keyboard is duckweed, and I personally like this design. 
1	This book needs to be studied well, even if it is not well written, the learning object is ideal. 
0	The surface is well done, and the bottom plastic materials and abrasives feel not of the same grade as the mold line boss 
1	Very nice hotel, first-class service, the staff are very dedicated, whether it is the front desk, the service desk, the porter or the driver, they are very enthusiastic and polite. On the last day, the hotel learned that I was on a flight at more than five in the afternoon and took the initiative to check out The time was delayed to three o'clock, and a bus was arranged to be delivered to the airport. This is the first time I have stayed in so many hotels. 
1	Learning from the experience of netizens, we booked a high-rise sea-view double bed room in the resort, which will stay on June 21-23. I am very happy that the service in Asia Pacific is not bad, and the rooms are arranged exactly according to our requirements. The waiter will also say hello when meeting guests in the corridor; having barbecue at the hotel at night, the service is also good. In general, the hotel's environment and bathing beaches are good. The swimming pool is beautiful in shape and the water is clear. The lighting of the pool at night is also very beautiful. This may be the reason for the off-season. The beaches are very quiet and suitable for vacation. The catch is that the room facilities are relatively old, the TV is too small, the fans and air conditioners are noisy, the telephone is also very old, and the slippers don't look very clean. Fortunately, we brought our own slippers. Another thing is that the breakfast should be criticized. Although there are many types, the taste is really not flattering. As an old five-star hotel, the room facilities are understandable and the cost of updating is too high. However, the quality of breakfast should be improved as soon as possible to match the star rating. . In addition, five-star hotels in Beijing will deliver fruits on the first day of stay, and even Guanhai Mulou on Wuzhizhou Island will deliver fruits. Unfortunately, Asia Pacific does not have them. This is also a service that welcomes guests. It is recommended Think about it in Asia Pacific. In general, the hotel is still very comfortable, which left us a good impression. 
1	The location of the hotel is good, the transportation is very convenient, the overall room feels okay, but the bathroom is a bit small. The breakfast provided by the hotel is not rich enough. The overall service consciousness of the hotel staff is good, especially the lobby manager, who specially sent us a local map when arranging the car reservation, which was very careful and thoughtful. 
1	"When I took the TAXI, I asked the driver how the hotel is, ""Old hotel, popular, good service, well-known."" When I arrived at the hotel, I felt very warm. The first time I came to this hotel, the staff were very enthusiastic, like knowing I’m the same, I’ve been on business for so long before I feel at home! The doorman went to find a car for me in heavy rain. When I got home, my pants were wet, which made me very touched. I can see the room, newly renovated, furniture/ The bedding is also new, but for people who have been on business for a long time, the feeling of home is more important./ "
1	"Recommend to everyone who wants to be independent and sober. Especially in China in recent years, there have been many kinds of cults and pyramid schemes. It is a great help to distinguish this group tour. It also helped me realize why the Chinese are always the targets of national violence attacks from other countries. The Chinese are too low-key outside, so that they lose themselves, lack of independent personality, national character and national character, and are not enough to maintain their dignity. So it is easy to become the object of imaginary teddy bears from other nations. Combined with ""We Want to Live with Dignity"", we can know what we want to do. "
1	This model is 2140 in shape, and is dressed in a black coat of the 1000 series. In terms of configuration and domestic licensed prices, this book has reached my ideal price. There are 3 USB ports, a video switch, a multi-function card reader slot, a wired network jack, microphone and headset share a jack. 
1	The configuration is worth the price, and the operation is stable. atmosphere. It took 20 minutes to install a GOUST version XP3 in the computer city. All the drivers are available, unexpected! I installed a fingerprint from the disk! Delivery is still almost 3 days! 
0	From the facade, the hotel does not appear to be grand enough, although the floors are high. The room has never been arranged with a front lake view, especially the reception standard at the front desk is really poor, there are complaints, and some are expressionless. 
1	The configuration is not low, but it is independent, chocolate keyboard, and mouse, only 5000 yuan, very cost-effective 
1	Low price RMB4599, good surface painting process, good overall configuration, independent display 256M with HDMI high-definition interface, good sound with built-in speakers, and a mouse and bag 
1	It's small and the keyboard is so big, I really like it. The system is also very good. I will continue to buy your things in the future. 
0	I have used THINKPAD for 6 years, and I have always considered it to be the best among notebooks! Now this new one makes me... hey!! 
0	I bought this book only after seeing the recommendation. After reading it, I felt that it did not conform to my judgment of values. Haha, the ideas in the book are too realistic, but the examples given are too unrealistic. I don't understand why so many people recommend this book. . . 
1	Fast delivery is an advantage. It’s the first time I buy something on JD. It feels like I was cheated. JD.com also claims to engage in event rebates, but it turns out that it can’t be used if it returns 150. It prompts that only three thousand can be used to use the 150; it’s like getting on a thief ship. 
1	R series has all the technology of TP, much better than SL. The price is not too expensive, the dual graphics card switching is very convenient. 
1	"I wrote two reviews, and I don’t know what to say in this one, haha... But I just saw someone saying that it’s normal, and I think it’s a little bit magical. Maybe my evaluation of this set of books is really too high~ ~Like ""Love and Life"", although this book is called ""Full of Love in the World"", it is not limited to the love of men and women, but also has social or family love, after reading it, there will still be a lot of feelings; If you just want to watch love, you can buy the ""Endless Love"". Finally, according to my classmate’s statement, this blue is a bit shabby, ha ha, but I personally think it’s pretty good ^^ "
0	Yu Dan's eloquence is outstanding, and his writing is fashionable but superficial. Although I can't understand the real Analects, I don't believe that the original intention of the old sage is so superficial! 
0	The worst 4-star hotel I have ever stayed in, the walls are not soundproof at all, the karaoke downstairs is noisy at night and I can’t sleep. The breakfast restaurants are all old men who come to drink morning tea nearby 
0	I regret that I don’t like this book very much. Although it’s a bestseller, I think I read a lot, and I don’t even want it to appear on my bookshelf. 
0	The sunny deluxe executive room booked was actually much smaller than the deluxe room booked by my colleague. If I didn't happen to visit my colleague, I would let the wine pass. The price difference between the two types of rooms is ￥150, and the expensive room is much smaller in size-not even as big as the standard room, and there is no change in other facilities! This kind of disguised cut-off approach is a fraud to consumers! There is no staff on duty on the executive floor of the hotel, nor any special services for executive guests: no executive lounge, no Happyhour, no dedicated service. 
1	Staying for the second time in Beijing, the room for 398 yuan is already very good. There is nowhere to eat breakfast, the hotel requires more than 100 breakfasts, which is too much to eat. The single room is very small, and it's still alive just for one or two nights. The room is very clean. 
1	When you talk about management, you may think of corporate management. In fact, human life and life also need management. In the book, Mr. Wu takes the identity of Zigong—a successful Confucian businessman. By explaining Confucius's daily preaching, teaching, and solving puzzles, he perfectly combines Confucianism and management to make our thinking Being baptized once has a great guiding significance for how to build a harmonious life system. At the same time, Mr. Wu corrected some misunderstandings and misunderstandings of Confucius' thoughts through this book, restored the true image of Confucius, and activated current effective wisdom.

0	The following is the information of Zhongtong ---------------- 06-17 The express arrived in Beijing and is being sorted 2009-06-20 Hu Xuemei in Mianyang is sending the parcel to pick it up on the afternoon of the 20th , Or the 21st 
0	Advantages: good location, large rooms, fast internet speed Disadvantages: not very clean (Xiaoqiang is found on the floor of the bathroom and restaurant), some negligence in cleaning the room (the bath liquid has not been replenished, and the water in the kettle has not been cleaned for a while ), the outside is noisy but the room has poor soundproofing. It took 20 minutes to leave the office. 
0	I read the room booked by the previous man on the Internet, and only stayed one night on the 12th. We were really enthusiastic when we first arrived and arranged for the driver to pick us up at the station. After check-in, Aunt Li (the owner’s sister) introduced and recommended attractions, itinerary arrangements, etc., because we don’t like prior arrangements and like to play casually. After chatting with Aunt Li for a while, we didn’t let her make arrangements. It is self-arranged. In the self-arranged play, I learned that they can get a certain benefit when they arrange or recommend tourists. The next day, we checked out and went to Lijiang River (Essence Tour, a section of Lijiang River from Xingping to Yangdi). Because of the large amount of luggage, we specifically asked the waiter if we could go ashore on Yangdi and go directly to Guilin. The waiter didn't know, so he ran to ask Aunt Li, and when he came back, he told him that he could go directly to Guilin in Yangdi. In this way, we carry all our luggage and go to the Lijiang River. However, in fact, the essence of the Lijiang River tour is to take a car from Yangshuo to Xingping Town. Xingping starts to take a motorized bamboo raft, upstream to the vicinity of Yangdi, and directly returns to Xingping without getting off the bamboo raft. In this way, it means that we have to run back and forth with heavy luggage, and the original intention was that if we had to return to Guilin or Yangshuo, we would find a place to store our luggage instead of running back and forth. Very unkind! Overall evaluation, the scenery is good, the picturesque mountains and rivers can be seen on the bed (view room), but it is not recommended because there is nothing to do after the evening, you can only go to Yangshuo city (actually there, no matter Any hotel, as long as there is a window, you will definitely be able to see the mountains and rivers), you still have to find a taxi or motorbike when you come back; there is no broadband in the room; it is best to bring your own toiletries; the waiter is still very kind and simple. 
0	Heavier, average heat dissipation, reaching more than 70 degrees when fully loaded. And the damn ASUS machine doesn't even have a corresponding XP driver, it's maddening. Only vista can be used. The XP compatible drive system is very unstable. 
1	Very close to the railway station and very convenient. Living in a standard room in the East Building, the room is larger compared to another hotel in Jiujiang. The toilet facilities are slightly old. The service is good. The 10 yuan Chinese breakfast is also good, very rich, and there is actually a sliced green vegetable soup. 
0	I've been to Sanya several times. The first few times were organized by the company. This time I went to Dadonghai with my wife and mother to take a vacation and take wedding photos. We chose the Sanya Pearl Sea View Hotel. Dadonghai’s light distribution is not as good as Yalong Bay. The facilities and services of the Pearl Sea View Hotel are even more disappointing and even annoying. We stayed in two rooms 3218 and 3219. The rooms are small and very old. During the day, I went to the beach and ate seafood. I came back to bed at night. I closed the doors and windows and heard some sounds that seemed to be waves. I didn’t pay much attention. At 12 o’clock in the evening, the sound became louder and louder, just like the roar of an airplane. People cannot sleep. The next day, my mother said that her head hurts because of the noise. I found out that the hotel’s boiler was at work. At this time, I made a wrong decision—be patient! The result was the same for three consecutive nights. The noise in the middle of the night was maddening. On the fourth night, I couldn’t fall asleep. At around 5 in the morning, I asked their manager on duty to see. They temporarily turned off the boiler but turned it back on at 8 in the morning. It’s really irritating. I approached their assistant in the lobby, a lady surnamed Li, to negotiate. She repeatedly dodged her until after 12 o’clock. Finally, I became angry. She let them go through a lady surnamed Zhou and talk to me. As a result, there were no compensation measures at all, and the attitude was quite hateful. I had to complain to 12315. As a result, the people at 12315 made me complain to the environmental protection department. They said that they would arrive at the scene for 40 minutes, but they were delayed. Due to time constraints, I Had to leave this hotel very disappointed. This painful trip made me remember this garbage hotel-Sanya Pearl Hotel! Especially that Ms. Lin and Ms. Zhou's shop bullied the customers! Supplementary comments January 3, 2008: If the majority of travellers must stay at this hotel, it is best to check the noise of the room on the spot, it should not be less than 60 decibels. 
1	"If the title is changed to ""Goldman Sachs History"" more appropriate text content! Because, according to this topic, I have always wanted to find out what techniques and far-reaching strategies Goldman Sachs used to win the current dominance. However, this article is only in the last chapter, and it has no expected effect. However, this book describes the development history of the US investment industry and Goldman Sachs and its different glory and failures, and it is worth reading. I just want to exhort the authors of today's literary world that when naming a book, you must be worthy of the audience, and you can't use the name to attract people first-the name should be preconceived, but the content should be more true!

1	The hotel is very quiet and is a typical business accommodation choice. Breakfast is not a buffet but a set menu is also very distinctive. The traffic is convenient mainly on the main roads of Tianjin. There are no entertainment facilities and people who like to live should not live here.

0	There are also shortcomings, but they are not big. 1. The trademark on the cover of the machine is scratched. Jingdong should report it to the manufacturer. Many netizens have encountered it; 2. The driver was difficult. The XP driver was driven overnight, but the driver of one camera did not come down. The server was too bad. Fortunately, the driver of the camera is universal, and it should be reported to the manufacturer.

He also took decoctions. The shortage is getting worse and worse. After reading Ma Yueling's book, I just After stopping fruits and cold medicine for the child, the child’s condition has improved significantly.

0	Checked in on May 1st, there is no room in other places, I have set up a special standard room of Jindi Constellation. When I checked in, I was told to upgrade to a superior standard room. I was overjoyed. I didn't expect to pass a messy road (like the outside of the kitchen) ) After arriving at Building 1, I was even more disappointed when I entered the room. Not to mention the small bed, there was nothing, the facilities were outdated, and the noise of the cars on the road was unbearable. I took a shower and the water flowed all over the place, hey, next time Might as well live in a chain business hotel, the price for the same conditions is only 2/3 at most.

0	It's not suitable for me when I am 29 years old. How can I find it so boring. I bought two Gaozhi comics, and I didn't like one of them, nor did one of my friends who love comics. 
0	The sound is too low. When it is turned to the maximum, the sound is too small and scary. It is best to buy headphones to listen to the song. The video is a bit dark at night, and the brightness is adjusted to the maximum. It is also a bit dark. The inner bag provided is too bad, I bought The white, black liner bag is provided, and the liner bag can't be sealed, I don't think it looks like the liner bag. 
1	The government hotel feels very grand and clean. The room layout of the entire hotel is also very neat. I checked in in May. Since the room could not be connected to the Internet on the first day, I coordinated with the front desk and changed another one with Internet access. I also helped to debug the laptop. The service was very attentive. There were people getting married during the two days of staying, and I feel that the banquet hall on the first floor of the hotel is very suitable for weddings 
1	Product positioning: mainstream entertainment notebook. After Lenovo acquired IBM, its design capabilities have become more powerful. At the 4,000 yuan level, Lenovo has basically never done it. This notebook looks good, the performance is still mainstream, and the design is relatively user-friendly. The only downside is that it uses Pentium Duo instead of Core Duo.

1	It took a whole week. feel good. Led screen with 130 graphics card to play games well. It's a little waste to use it for office alone. It should be worth the price. 
0	This book was touted very well at the time, it looks very easy to understand, and it has a bit of truth in life, but after I bought it, it may be because I don’t like reading foreign books. I don’t even go into it. It's from Korea, but there are still some differences in some places, and the written text feels quite theoretical, maybe you can read it with patience. But at least it is certain that some of the words in it are very reasonable. 
0	The keyboard hits loudly, especially the small keyboard, the opening button is not easy to use, it is not easy to open, there are burrs on the edge of the shell, and it cannot be activated with OEM VISTA 
0	This book was pretty good at first, but later I found the content to be too boring. I read one third of it and I don’t want to read it anymore. This book advocates that finding a good job is better than finding a good husband. I hate this view. 
1	Screen 15.4, widescreen 16:10 is good for watching movies. I won’t say a G keyboard. IBM’s keyboard is recognized as the world’s best hard drive with the best hand-feeling and quality 250G. I usually download 480p movies in mkv format. The movie is only about 1.5GB, haha, this hard drive is more than enough for more than a hundred movies. The CPU is a dual-core 1.6G main frequency, although it is a relatively low-end Celeron series, but as long as it is not a large-scale professional software or something , The gap with Core and Pentium is basically indistinguishable 
0	The overall quality of this hotel is very poor, there is a strong smell of oily smoke in the room. 
1	The standard room in the VIP building is well decorated and can reach the three-star standard. The service is also very good, very quiet at night. It was when I checked out on the third day after staying for two nights that the internet was blocked and I couldn't use a credit card. I was very depressed at that time. Since I didn't bring much cash, I went to the bank to withdraw money to pay the room fee. Hotel feedback July 30, 2008: Dear customer: Hello! Thank you for your support to Jincheng Hotel! The inconvenience caused by the hotel's network failure, we apologize to you! Related issues have been reported to relevant departments! Welcome to stay at my hotel again! 
0	The lobby is too disappointing. The room is small. The price is very low. Will not live again next time. 
0	The boyfriend is the first time a foreigner came to Shanghai, so he chose to stay in a hotel close to the Bund. Checking in on the 25th is all OK. The surrounding environment of the hotel is not good, but the closeness to the Bund is generally acceptable. When we checked out on the 26th, the lady at the front desk said that we had to charge 10 yuan for the condom in the room, but I really didn’t use it. Of course we would bring this kind of stuff. If the front desk said you were useless, the foreigner took it. There are a lot of people. I’m really embarrassed to argue with the front desk for this set of issues. My boyfriend also said that he didn’t take it. I didn’t say it for 10 yuan after thinking about it. But if this hotel treats every guest like this How much more can you earn on a day of 10 yuan? Due to a lot of luggage, we left things in the hotel on the 27th and came back to live. My boyfriend stayed in the hotel alone when I had something to do that day. The next day I came to pick up my boyfriend. The boyfriend said that a young lady called last night and asked if he wanted a massage. Don’t wait a while. An old woman brought two young ladies to knock on the door and say that your girlfriend is not here tonight. It only costs 200 yuan for a lady to help you massage. I am shocked. Is the hotel’s monitoring function just like this? ? Is it rare that there are eyeliners everywhere in the hotel to monitor guests? When her boyfriend said he didn't want to, they just didn't leave. Later, when her boyfriend said you don't leave, I called them to the police and left. In the evening, my boyfriend and I went out to have a meal. Next to our room is the recreation center. A thin man just saw my boyfriend and I come out of the room. He actually came to me and asked me with a very bad attitude. Who are you? I said I was his girlfriend. He asked the foreigner if she was your girlfriend? What is it about him? Why did he ask me, my boyfriend asked WHAT HAPPEN? Later, my boyfriend said that we were on vacation, not to affect our mood for this kind of thing. But I was so angry that I called the lobby manager to complain and asked the man to apologize to me. The lobby manager surnamed Lu said sorry on the phone that the recreation center massage was contracted to someone else. It’s rare to contract to others and let them do things without management? No one knocked on the door the next day, but no one came to apologize in person. In short, staying in this hotel is the flaw of our entire holiday, I will never stay in this hotel again. Hotel Feedback January 4, 2008: First of all, thank you very much for staying at our hotel. Secondly, the hotel would like to explain the main issues raised by the guests: The old woman and the two young ladies mentioned in the article are not employees of our hotel and have nothing to do with our hotel. The three ladies have indeed visited the room. When they visited, they entered the lobby of our hotel as a friend of the guest in the room. The security staff registered the three ladies in accordance with the normal visitor procedures, and the monitoring system of our hotel did it. To monitor. In order to protect the privacy of visitors, the hotel will not disclose their names here. The hotel aims to provide guests with the highest quality and most comfortable service, and is also very willing to accept guests’ opinions, suggestions and even criticisms in order to make our services better. 
1	It looks pretty good, and I don't feel any big changes in Lenovo now. But it’s not for me to buy it for others. 
0	1. The battery is only 3 cores. 2. There is no CD-ROM drive, it is troublesome to install the system, and it does not support USB-ZIP. It can only be started in USB-HDD mode, which took me a lot of time. 3. The price is still quite expensive 
1	The accommodation environment is good and relatively clean. The service attitude at the front desk was very good. A young man, we said we wanted to karaoke, so he took us to see the room and told me how to eat more conveniently. Speaking of eating, I suggest eating in the restaurant of the hotel, which is not much more expensive than the so-called food court outside. I feel it personally. There is also a self-driving car. The last thing I can't figure out is to drive to the store by myself, and actually charge me 20 yuan for parking fees. This is simply too unreasonable. I feel a little crazy about money! ! ! 
1	It has been thirty years since reform and opening up, and not everyone has accompanied it all the way down. Even if it is, you may be in the Lushan Mountain and only have a glimpse of the leopard. Therefore, it is undoubtedly a good choice to use such a good book to understand the past thirty years. In fact, I read this book because of the recommendation of the Minister of Finance. After I bought it, I spent a week reading the first volume, and I was very attracted. After 80s, I graduated from university and I am preparing to show my skills in the financial center of Shanghai. This kind of economics books has helped me understand the experience of my predecessors and has really benefited me a lot. 
1	I just received it today. Repartitioning and installing the driver. The wireless network card is the legendary RTL dropped network card, but everything is working normally. 
0	If you can have Bluetooth, it will be perfect. It is not convenient for business use without Bluetooth. The model with Bluetooth also has a camera. Besides, why didn’t I find the original package in the box? Doesn't everyone have it? 
1	I can't say that there is no problem, but all the staff of the hotel are using a kind of enthusiasm to give every guest the best possible service, so I am willing to give the highest evaluation to this hotel. 
1	Price is an advantage. . . Haha I bought the computer for my colleague and installed a system for him. . . Blue screen several times. . . Stuck several times. . . But I think it is normal, the new machine in my hands. . Few of them don’t even make a blue screen. . . . I feel that the speed of the machine is good. . . The most important thing is the high cost performance~ 
0	The book is still new and can't be read. The protagonist is a woman, the working environment is a multinational company, there is no resonance~ I really can't stand it~ Maybe it's a good book~ Maybe it's too popular~ I don't like it~ 
0	The pre-installed vista partition is quite abnormal; after being converted to XP, after running pplive to open the accelerator, it often gets stuck. The left hand part is hot 
0	The customer service was a little foolish, and the hard disk was faulty. The customer service had no choice but to take a tough attitude. Fortunately, the customer service staff was sent to replace the hard disk and the problem was solved. 
0	The most abused hotel can't do anything. Don't go to this kind of hotel. 3 stars in the 80s 
0	I thought a three-star hotel would be good, and booked four single rooms. The receptionist saw that we were out of town. The smallest single room he gave us was only 6 square meters. The other room was very musty, and the conditions were obviously not met. Three-star single room standard, we ask to check out, no. The one who lives in 6 square meters is a driver, dare not to say, thought I arranged for him to be so big. Later, when we learned that we had negotiated with the main station, we barely changed two rooms for us. Our colleagues agree that this hotel is terrible. Evaluation: Poor service attitude, poor rooms, no parking lot... Anyway, everything is terrible, and I immediately changed places the next day. This member's evaluation is absolutely true, and it is recommended not to choose this hotel. 
1	The heat dissipation is very good, the material is acceptable, the distribution is fast and the price is protected, and it is a very cost-effective notebook 
0	I placed an order but did not receive the book, depressed! ! ! If you don’t update the webpage and discover that the stock is out of stock during the distribution, you should notify the customer in time! 
0	"Dear readers, I especially like reading books and I very much support Dangdang.com for providing me with a platform for buying books. After reading the book ""Those Things in the Ming Dynasty"", to be honest, I personally dislike it very much. The most important thing is the lack of literary talent. It is difficult for a book to succeed without good language. As a history book, its story is very poor, sometimes humorous for the sake of humor, it seems particularly vulgar. A lot of reasoning is interspersed in the book, which makes the content of the book very complicated, uncoordinated, and uncomfortable. I don't know if I feel the same with me, this is just my humble opinion. In this tumultuous age, it is really not easy to write a book, but not easy to write a high-quality book. "
1	Catch up with the event, free memory, free mobile hard drive, free leather bag, it's a great deal! Great value book, using genuine Vista system, after configuration, the speed is not bad! Jingdong’s delivery speed is really fast! Order in the morning and pick up in the afternoon! 
1	I stayed in the Xinhaohua Seaview Room. The only advantage is that you can see the sea but the room is very small and very old. It is a very old hotel. Next time I have a chance to come to Dadonghai, I should not choose this hotel. The only advantage of this hotel The transportation is convenient. Although it is an old hotel, the hygiene is very good. Additional comment December 24, 2007: The room is too small 
0	The room is okay, relatively large, but it is close to the road, and I was woken up by the sound of vehicles in the morning, and the sauna is not good. After a shower, my friend and I lost 200 yuan. I suspect that someone has stolen money there. If you friends go , Never bring cash. 
0	The appearance is too easy to leave fingerprints, and the Lenovo staff is too rubbish, can't it be divided into more areas? ? A big area, really terrible. Also, the Vista system is too rubbish, it is better to pre-install XP. 
1	Overall it feels good, the standard room of 191 yuan/room is good value for money. 
0	The content inside is very shallow, and not systematic, there is no need to buy and collect. However, the author's love for life is still worth learning. I believe that only those who love life can live hard. 
0	When I came to Lhasa, I realized that the price of this hotel is indeed high. The same level of hotel on Beijing Road only costs less than 200 yuan. The biggest problem is the noisy environment and poor sleep. 
0	When using the power adapter, the heat generation is amazing, I am a little worried that it will burn out, the touchpad is too sensitive, the buttons of the touchpad are indeed a bit hard, the plastic shell is not very strong, like a toy, not as good as the assembly process of ASUS's big book. 
0	Only stayed for one night, the room was small, but considering that it was only a three-star hotel, the requirements could not be too high, but the facilities in the room were very outdated, and some facilities were obviously broken for a long time and were not repaired. My credit card is not from the four major state-owned banks, so I can’t do pre-sales. I can’t swipe my card directly. The lady at the front desk said that my card is not a credit card, so I feel dizzy. Even if I don’t recognize the visa logo, I should recognize the UnionPay logo. Well, it wouldn't be said that you can't even swipe your card like a savings card! 
0	There are still some details to be perfected: 1. The delivery service must be perfect. The order was placed on June 10, and the same city delivery only arrived on the 16th. 2. The picture shows that the computer operation surface is black, and the actual received is gray. 3. The supporting driver The program is based on vista, you need to download it yourself to install windows 
1	The lobby is not very good, but the room is very comfortable. The most satisfying place is the hotel's lobby assistant and customer service staff, who can timely and do their best to complete the customer's requirements. It makes people feel at home. Take this to thank them. 
1	Because it is a computer I like, of course I feel good. Although the configuration is not high, but it is very good to have such a computer at this price`~ 
1	The keyboard is relatively large, larger than the S2 keyboard of the same factory, and has good comfort. The sinking shaft design is also better than the original S2, which is much simpler and smaller when opened. 
0	I ordered a single room, but there was no broadband. I changed to a business single room, but it was in the VIP building at the back, a four-story building. The room condition is very general, but it is a standard room with one bed removed. Outside the window is the courtyard wall. The soundproofing of the room is poor, and the snoring sound of the next room can be heard. 
1	The rooms are well decorated and the breakfast is good. Easy access. recommend. 
0	It’s not as good as imagined. The book reviews are overly boasting. The book is very large and heavy, and the pictures are very similar. It may be an early American work, which is outdated 
1	The rooms on the executive floor of the same price are large and small, so please pay attention. The restrooms are well decorated and furnished, with showers and bathtubs, as well as light windows. The interior of the room is relatively large and the service is better! The overall feeling is pretty good. Many foreigners stay here. 
1	I bought it at 4999. In all fairness, I bought this workmanship at this price, which is pretty good. He looks very capable and is good for business. 
1	I got it yesterday. I usually buy it with 5.1. It’s 200 yuan cheaper. It’s very affordable. You don’t need to bargain with others. It’s easy to get more colors on JD.com. After waiting for a long time, it’s good. 
0	It is the five-star hotel with the worst service I have ever stayed in. The temperature dropped and the air conditioner was not hot, and it was shivering with cold. The massage lady is all-pervasive. Regardless of whether the male guests are traveling with their wives, even in the elevator, they are crazy about whether or not to massage. Mother Sang was even more exaggerated and asked my husband at the door of our room if he would like to massage her. She is the most beautiful lady his mother Sang can arrange. If there is a problem, the duty manager will be ignored. I don't know how this hotel is rated as a five-star. 
1	The configuration is reasonable, the functions are complete, the wine red is beautiful, the keyboard is very flexible, and the hand feels good. The current price is also good, no bright spots and dark spots were found. Jingdong delivery is fast enough. 
1	Perfect screen, stylish appearance, beautiful keyboard, high performance-price ratio, and if the budget is not too high, you can consider it. The heat dissipation of the cooling base provided is still good. Booting without the system is all in English, you can install xp by changing the hard disk transmission mode to IDE, and the machine comes with a driver CD. 
1	The LED screen is really good. It's not bad to drop by 100 before picking it up, and it saves a little bit. Haha, it's a bit depressing when I pick up the goods and go home. It may be to suppress the opponent, hehe is out of stock! 
0	A very bad hotel, I only considered staying at this hotel after reading online reviews. As a result, everything was overstated. I stayed in the 788 deluxe single room. After I checked in, I found that the hotel room was very bad, the room was very small, and the towels and bed sheets were very dirty. I feel unclean. I feel a bit cold at night. I want to have more quilts with the hotel. As a result, I was told that if I added more quilts, I had to add more money. Psychologically very upset. So I decided to check out the next day. When I checked out in the morning, I told me that I stained the bed sheet (there were mosquitoes in the night, and some blood stains on the bed sheet might be broken when I was scratching. I haven't claimed a claim from your hotel. It). So I argued with the front desk, and then brought me the sheets down and confronted the front desk. Maybe the front desk also thinks that the blood stains are nothing. Even if I ask for money, it will pass. If I insist on giving me money, I will quarrel with the front desk, but it is not enough. I will consider calling the police. Then gave me the bill and found out that I was overcharged by RMB 5, and asked what was going on, saying it was the city construction fee. I don't care if I have this fee or not, but I have been booking hotels on Xiecheng for as much as possible. If you charge any city construction fees, you can. Please add this fee to the room rate when signing a contract with Xiecheng. What the hell. Five yuan is nothing, but it makes me feel very uncomfortable. So he asked his hotel to show me the relevant regulations. As a result, the so-called lobby manager never came out after entering. Fortunately, a Shanghai friend used the Shanghai dialect to talk to them. I don't know what to say. I didn't dare to ask for the money after I came here. Later, a friend told me that the front desk said that Japanese people like to live in this hotel. Sorry, I'm not Japanese. Japanese people like it. That's someone else's business. It has nothing to do with me. If you like Japanese people, please explain to me and don't accept Chinese people. After checking out and leaving, I felt like escaping from a black shop. I don't know if Xiecheng will take care of this matter. However, if this happens again in the future, it will affect my impression of Xiecheng. All in all, a bad hotel. Now it is the off-season to dare to ask for this price, it is really crazy. Maybe this hotel is mainly aimed at monthly subscription customers, and other individual customers caught a black one. I suggest you not go to this bad hotel. 
0	1 The bottom is hotter. 2 In windows7 system, the network card driver will be lost when the network cable driver is unplugged. It needs to be reinstalled. I wonder if it is a software problem. 
0	No shortcomings have been found for the time being. . The Guangzhou headquarters is too concealed. After searching for a long time, there is also a test machine for nearly two hours. If the waiter can get a glass of water, there is nothing to say. 
1	"It is the greatest success of a horror novel author who can make people feel fearful. I am opposed to those gods and ghosts, which are too virtual and have no sense of reality. Some people’s works have good plots. Mysterious and horrible, because it is very close to reality. I have read a lot of Zhou Dedong’s novels. I don’t know if some of them are written in the name of the author. The writing is too fake, and the mysterious stuff is enough for one time. It's boring. ""The Dead"" is a good novel, worth recommending. Because only ""people"" are the most scary things, and ghosts only exist in people's hearts. "
1	This book is good. After reading it, I will know how to face and solve the problems in my own or surrounding relationships. This is not available in the school. Of course, this is to rely on oneself to comprehend the thoughts in the book. Since this is a translation, and most of it is collected from speeches, it is more colloquial, but it doesn't matter. Read it a few times and you will gain a lot. I prefer the way of asking and answering in the book, because there are some questions I want to ask. I suggest that friends who have just made their debut in society can read it. Maybe he can bring you some sober awareness. 
0	The battery life is weak, and the battery is dead in less than two hours. Without the system CD, the machine is easy to get fingerprints 
1	I have stayed twice. I am quite satisfied, especially the pick-up service, which can be picked up by one person, timely and thoughtful. The broadband speed is also relatively fast. But there is no free fruit plate that everyone said. 
0	The appearance is okay, but the environment inside can’t be mentioned. The bathroom has an inexplicable smell, I wanted to take a bath, but after seeing the bathroom, I still dismissed the idea! Breakfast only has bread, porridge, pickles, and pigeon eggs The size of the eggs. After eating, unexpectedly 
0	This is an elementary school book. I used the method of storytelling in the past to write books. It is deeply loved by elementary students. As for whether middle school students like it, it is not known. As an adult, I am not too interested. 
0	The configuration is general, maybe the small book is basically like this, it is very portable to take it out. Sima gift bag, mouse, inner liner are not sent 
0	"I felt cheated when I bought this book. The content in it is really average, but it's suitable for elementary school students. Through the 100 forums of CCTV10, Yu Dan became an academic star like Yi Zhongtian. It is true that Yu Dan has a very attractive personality and cultural temperament, but this is very empty and very one-sided. ""The Analects of Yu Dan"" has sold more than 4.5 million copies, which does not explain much, it is just the effect of the flock. If you are still at the elementary or junior high school level, I suggest you read Yu Dan's ""The Analects"" and ""Zhuangzi"" experience. For those above high school, it is best to read the series of works by Fu Peirong. If you read Fu Peirong's ""The Analects"" and ""Zhuangzi"", you will feel that Yu Dan's understanding of the Analects is far lower than that of Mr. Fu Peirong. To evaluate Yu Dan with one of the famous lines that Mr. Yi Zhongtian said in the forum of one hundred schools, ""but that's it."" "
1	1. The basic configuration is perfect-1.6GHZ chip, 1G memory, 160G hard disk, 1024*600 display, wireless network card, 1.3 million pixels, 3 USB ports 2. The white small book is more beautiful in shape, an important point for girls when shopping 3. The battery is powerful (the most important part of choosing it, the price is more weight), it can have 6-7 hours of use time by browsing the web only 4. The heat dissipation is really good, and it is not hot after a few hours 
0	It's very heavy, and it’s very tiring to carry it out. It seems that there is a bright spot on the screen, but it is small (the screen is originally small, haha), not obvious, but this does not seem to be a quality problem? I don’t understand it well, it’s not obvious. Up... 
0	I bought the full set and I have never seen such a rubbish. In fact, only one copy is enough, and the rest is permutation and combination. Such a book can also be a best-selling book in the United States? This is why you can’t see it in bookstores. In less than two minutes, you can understand what piece together and repetition are. After seeing the real thing, I am afraid that no one wants to buy it. This is just a set of books that the booksellers have collected irresponsibly, but if I don’t pay attention, I will be fooled. I'm stupid! 
0	"Checking in this hotel should be regarded as being misled by Ctrip and put it in the first choice position. If the introduction of the hotel adds a note saying ""next to the cemetery"", it is estimated that all business is gone. Li Yue (and Lido) should really thank Ctrip. "
1	I bought this book as a gift to my dad, so I took a look at it myself. well. Although the story chapters of the mythological content in the middle are not well understood, the author's deep analysis and interpretation and symbolic meaning are very good. Although it is a book for men, I am a girl and I think it is suitable. Maybe it's my relatively masculine character and thinking. . Or I understand that there are many things that are suitable not only for sons and fathers, but also for children and parents (including the relationship between daughters and mothers). well. I feel as long as I am interested in my inner self. You can try this book. 
1	At this price, the configuration in ASUS is very strong, very good value, the appearance is more beautiful than the picture, the heat dissipation is also good, the screen is better than other brands used before, and it is very cool to watch movies. 
1	Can't live in a room close to the road, too noisy, I didn't sleep well all night. There is a big supermarket next to it, easy to eat 
1	After reading this book, what made me cry more than the part describing the family relationship, the description was very successful, very sincere, without any pretentiousness, the author's knowledge is really good. If a book can make you cry and laugh, then it is really worth seeing. If I want to recommend this book, it is absolutely family! In this way, it is a step higher than ordinary romance novels, but I still feel a little inadequate, that is, the heroine finally missed Lu Licheng. Alas, maybe I am her, I will choose Lu. The ending of the novel is over, but the ending in my heart is still not over. Who can guarantee that they really have no future. 
1	The hotel hardware and software facilities are good, the service is also very professional, I will often stay in this hotel when I go to Hong Kong. 
1	I can't believe that people who once loved each other will go farther and farther in the long river of time. The ending of the story is that they are divorced, but this is not the only one. This is not the only thing that the actor did not cheat under the strong temptation. The reason for their divorce is that everyone is tired, and more people will feel sad for this entanglement. So, the hero and heroine finally wanted to leave and left. But in our lives, there are too many heroes and heroines who can't figure it out, and they barely live together for a heavy fame. Whether to leave or not to leave, this is really a difficult question to answer. 
0	After receiving the goods, I found that the keyboard of the fuselage was seriously deformed. I hope Jingdong can handle it. I hope to return the goods. . 
1	The hotel is relatively old, but the equipment is well maintained. The service is good and the surrounding area is more attentive. I came back at night and turned down and I felt very good. The mall downstairs is said to be the best in Jinan, I feel good~~` 
1	The location of the hotel is very convenient. It is very close to the first floor and the night market. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is very affordable for 10 yuan. The service is good but the room is large but the facilities are a bit old, especially the bathroom is small. 
1	Hotel service is in place, always considerate to customers. The room is clean. Will stay next time. Additional comment July 2, 2008: Miss Yan Lei's service is very good. 
0	I went to the direct store to mention it. The attitude of the lady at the front desk was not good, as if she had just quarreled with her husband, her facial expression was stiff and she had a big frame. 
1	Very clean and beautiful. The keyboard is not as small as in the legend. It is easy to use. A good choice for girls. 
0	"Check in, it's ""Eleventh"" soon, don't stay in this hotel! Especially friends in their own cars! My car was parked in their underground parking lot and it was marked out of recognition! So far, the hotel has not given a statement. It is said that the parking lot belongs to the property management, except for parking problems, find the property company. The room was adjusted three times to reach the predetermined standard! It is said to be five-star, but in fact it is under decoration. I think it is the target five-star. "
0	"I have never seen such a dilapidated five-star hotel. The elevators, corridors, and the carpets in the rooms can be described as terrible. The edges of the carpets in the elevators are fluffy and tattered. It is a bad analogy. Our house uses it to cushion dogs. The carpet tiles in the house look cleaner and neater than it is. The carpets in the room and corridors feel like they have been used for at least ten years; the wall tiles in the bathroom look like low-grade things, white cement in the ditch. Small holes began to appear, like the door of an ant’s nest; the faucet and towel rack were rusty and the color was suspicious, and the brand of sanitary ware was unpredictable. On the contrary, the brand of the soap box for bath soap clearly showed that it was ""COTTO ""What kind of thing is this? I believe anyone who knows a little about building materials will know that the brand of towels in the bathroom is unknown, but it feels dry and hard. It seems to be at least three years old. What's more terrifying is the curtains, God. Ah, I suspect that the curtains of this hotel have never been cleaned, and the colors are obscure. I just opened and closed them twice. When I washed my hands, the soap bubbles turned dark. I lived in Room 1520, and it seemed that they had been flooded. Water and the color of the carpet are not counted as weird, and the boards of the footing line are obviously not installed at the same time. Originally, the service in the lobby of this hotel was quite satisfactory to me. Whether it was the check-in or the smiles of the check-in attendants, I was very happy, but the room service was a bit unclear. I checked in around 4pm. The room took a nap for an hour before going out to socialize, but when I returned to the hotel more than nine o’clock after socializing, the complimentary fruit was already on the bar counter, and the bed, what it looked like when I got up, was still so naturally messed up. There, I suddenly lost my appetite like swallowing a fly, and my good feelings disappeared. The security and porter services at the entrance are also very poor. The square in front of the entrance is a circle. The taxis that come in can stop at any position of the circle to pick up and drop off the passengers. The small entrance often stops several times from various angles. There is a car to pick up and drop off passengers there, and the hotel is ignored. No one is keeping order. The same is true for taxis at the hotel. There is no queuing corridor. Everyone is standing at the door waiting for the bus. It is really unclear. First come first, there are some minor disputes arising from the order of taxis from time to time! The biggest feature of this hotel is sales. There are price lists for selling things and promotion cards that encourage them to join their points program everywhere in the room. Even stationery and personal items have sales price lists erected on the bedside table. I really don’t know. Is this for convenience or to maximize sales. And for free things, because I’m used to bringing my own toiletries on business trips, I don’t know the quality of their toiletries, but the quality of the disposable slippers, ahem, are they bought from Yiwu Commodity City? Hey, it’s rare to see it. The water presented is from C'estbon, but I added a hotel advertisement as if I was afraid of losing money. The elevator that came up from the parking lot of this hotel was at the entrance of Sichuan Hotel. When I checked in, I saw the registration desk as soon as I went out. I used to know that it was the front desk of Sichuan Hotel when I was almost finished registering. So I apologized and transferred to Holiday Hotel. The front desk went through the check-in procedures again. As a result, ahem, the result made me regret that I should have made a mistake at the beginning. According to a friend in Chengdu, the hardware conditions of Sichuan Hotel are slightly better than Crowne Plaza, and the price is only Crowne Plaza’s It's only half, the two families are next to each other and have a common door. What and what is this? I am already a diamond member of Ctrip. I have never made any reviews on any hotel. During my trip to Sichuan, I first checked in at the Fuleshan Jiuzhou International Hotel in Mianyang. It was so exquisite that I was breathless and uncomfortable. I was in Chengdu due to the change of itinerary. I stayed at Crowne Plaza temporarily, both of which are five-star hotels. It made me feel that I moved from a real five-star hotel to a guest house at the railway station, and I paid twice as much for accommodation than a real five-star hotel. fee. You can't make money by getting the selection agency to get five small stars and then earn it so deliberately! Five-star big car shop, goodbye, I will never go again, to paraphrase the buzzword: make money, be kind! "
1	"The story is simple, but the ordinary reflects life, mainly because the author's writing makes people feel bored. I still like it, but it still makes people a little bit chilling. Men always do this. They use a woman as a tool to retaliate against another woman, and then they like this ""tool"". The original sweetheart is gone. In fact, women are the same, but if a woman does this, she will be crushed to death by a man, and she will really get true love if she does. It’s not like a man, as long as the skin is thick enough, it can be worn until a woman nods her head for forgiveness, but women dare to wait like this? All of a sudden there will be women left. "
0	Why is the delivery so slow? My order on the 17th hasn't arrived yet? I'm eager to use these books and hope they can be delivered before this weekend. Thank you. 
0	If you do not provide drinking water in accordance with the service agreement, you still have to argue and are unwilling to improve. Many places in foreign countries are accustomed to drinking drinking water directly, not requiring guests to drink tap water that has been boiled. The two cannot be equated. Additional comments February 5, 2008: This hotel was rated as Ctrip 4 stars, I think there is a problem. Some evaluations are not objective. Some evaluation articles say that they are booking rooms for people who come to Beijing on a business trip, and then talk about the feelings of staying in Beijing. I hope that Ctrip (I heard that it has been listed in the United States and has great ambitions) will not become a street soliciting company. 
0	In the same grade of laptops, the cost performance is high, the configuration is sufficient, the brand effect is good, the appearance is good, and more advantages are to be discovered in use 
1	I grabbed it at 1599 and bought something for someone else to collect 2000. It just so happened that a ticket of 2000-100 was used in the lottery, and I used a U disk to do the system at once. 
1	The hardware and software are quite good, the room environment is elegant, the service is warm and considerate, and the breakfast is also very good. It is a pity that the road at the entrance has become a one-way street, which is a bit inconvenient. But the price-performance ratio is absolutely high. Next time I go to Shenyang, I will still choose this hotel unswervingly! ! 
1	The most cost-effective and cost-effective laptop! (Sex—performance, beauty—beautiful) The configuration of 5,000 yuan, the price of 3,000 yuan, the salary loves the Americans, who is it? The 3,000-dollar Gateway notebook and the 4,000-plus HP notebook are placed together, and the HP notebook looks like shit! 
1	If the country of Japan is still only about book knowledge, then this book is really worth reading~~ The entire book is in the form of comics to drip Japan’s history, national conditions, and certain social roots. It was revealed that even the most boring economic issues for me were written very simple and easy to understand, vivid and interesting~ I almost read this book in one breath, and I have definitely benefited a lot. The only thing that makes me feel a little puzzled is The introduction on the back cover does not seem to have much to do with the content in the book (?) A family statement, for reference only~ In general, this book is worth recommending! 
1	This book by Mr. Chen is wonderful! Whether it is from the text, materials or the logical structure of the entire book, it is very unforgettable! Read it carefully, it is very helpful for both professionals and non-professionals! The viewpoint of metabolism in modern society that Chen Lao put forward is also very influential in academic circles! And in this academic work, Mr. Chen explained to us this result of his hard work in plain but beautiful words! Many of Chen Lao's disciples also inherited his style of study and rigorous scholarship. impressive! 
0	Dirty, noisy, small, slow, so I won’t say much. Mainly a safety issue! ! ! ! I forgot to bring the door card, and just saw the waiter nearby, I told him to open the door. She actually opened the door and let me in without asking my name. Waterfall cold... I have never seen such a convenient one. If it is a thief, haha, it must be laughed to death. My computer PSP or something is still in the room, I don’t know who to cry if I lose it 
1	It feels very light in the hand, low heat generation, comfortable material, the keyboard is also very comfortable, and the keyboard light is very practical! I think of so much for the time being, and I will add it later. 
0	I don’t know if it is the cause of the machine itself, or the problem of the installed XP system, occasionally the keyboard will not respond 
1	The breakfast food is quite average, not in line with its service standard, I hope further improvement. 
1	The appearance and workmanship are first-class, the metal body has a very good texture, the borderless screen is cool, and the built-in HP management software is convenient and practical. 
0	The keyboard layout has been modified. I still like the previous IBM layout and keep it the same as the desktop computer. I was delayed by Lenovo and the keyboard light was also removed. No wonder the price is so cheap. 
0	Outside the window on the 6th floor is the fan of the entire building, which is very noisy! It may be reserved for Ctrip customers, and the house has not been cleaned after returning to the room at 4 pm the next day. It is too outrageous!!!!! 
0	Give up, don't be fooled by the title of the book, this book is not suitable for Chinese parents at all, and there is no actual content at all. The most worth remembering is the title of this book, read it out loud for your children! 
0	"Friends who come to Suzhou, think about it, recommend the Royal Court, who makes it close. I remembered when I arrived at the door. I haven't booked yet. I immediately dialed 4008206666, and the car arrived at the door. The guard asked: Is there a reservation? Answer: Booking is in progress. Please raise the railing and we will go to the front desk. Guard: No. Q: Why? Doorman: Cannot enter without a reservation. Q: We can make a reservation directly at the front desk. Doorman: No, there is no room. Q: How do you know? We are contacting the front desk, and your elder brother calls to ask, or let us go in and ask directly, if there is no room, we turn around and leave, and you have nothing to lose. Doorman: Just no, there is no room, and there are regulations that you cannot enter without reservation. Question: Then I tell you that I have a reservation, can I go in? ...... But no matter how we explain, there is no way to move a step. At this time, a car came from behind and wanted to enter the hotel. As my car was blocked, no one could get in. At this time, Ctrip's call has been answered, the room has been booked, and you can move in immediately. He also received a notice from the front desk, so he lifted the bar to release the car, but he didn't even apologize, and didn't feel that he was doing something wrong. At this time, the fire in my heart had burned to the top of my head, and it was really uncontrollable, so I shouted at him a few words, ""Why do you say there is no room?"" Fortunately, my friends didn't care. But for such management, such a service attitude is really annoying. If the doorman makes a phone call to the front desk of the hotel, it is easy to know if there is a room, and doing so will not do any good to the hotel itself. Obviously, the room is not sold. Is the hotel so wealthy and the shop bullies its customers? Hotel feedback August 14, 2008: Thank you for choosing and staying at Suzhou Regalia Hotel Apartments. Your valuable comments have attracted great attention. Our hotel will continue to work hard and actively improve to create a beautiful, warm Comfortable living environment, sincerely thank you for your support to our hotel. "
0	It's a bit heavy and thick; the outer frame of the screen is a bit wider, if it's narrower, the touchpad feels bad. LINUX system is very unaccustomed to use. 
0	The weight is a bit heavier, and the heat is still a bit after long-term operation. With VISTA, it is basically a tasteless. XP is still used for small books. There is no XP driver in the driver disk. You need to find it online, which is more troublesome. 
1	"My kid was very happy when he got the book on eight days a week and asked us to tell him. I listened to it again and again, and pestered his father five times that night. Now I open the book myself, and when I see that God got the one, I will say ""God."" Sometimes he will do bad things, we say: David can't! He listens occasionally. If I squat on the ground, open my hand and say: baby, come here. He will come happily, even if he is being naughty or making trouble, he will come, and then I hug him and tell him: baby, mother loves you. He will also say happily, love his mother. Ha ha. . "
0	1. There is no XP sound card driver in the driver disk. Go to the website to download. 2. A lot of drivers, almost install one and restart once 3. The plastic feels too strong 
0	It's too tasteless. It seems that the rankings should be pretty good, but I didn't expect it to be so boring and empty, no one would be able to tell the truth, it's too boring, not to mention the general truth is still... how to put it, people dare to agree. 
0	The keyboard feels bad, I don't dare to apply a lot of energy, and it is very light and careful when typing. It feels easy to break 
1	"After reading ""Charlotte's Net"", I met a pig who can spend a few springs and autumns (the 2 protagonists of this book)-Wilbur. Of course there is the protagonist-Charlotte. A. Kavatika-a spider. She spent her life for Wilbur through several springs and autumns. At the last moment of her life, she hatched her children: five hundred and fourteen children (little spiders) and asked Wilbur to take them back to the farm. I think this book can be said to be an animal world (of course many animals are not mentioned in this book, only our common animals) "
0	Why is it easy to blue screen after installing the system in half an hour? What's the situation? Know the contact under QQ: 252620710! 
0	1. The pre-installed LINUX will affect the installation of XP or VISTA. 2. The left side cooling vent will affect the keyboard. If you use it in summer, you may need to install the base 3. The driver installation disk is not easy to use 
1	The CPU is powerful, P8600　2.4G, good heat dissipation, the machine basically does not heat up, there is a keyboard light on the top, and a built-in microphone. Basically worth the price, I still grabbed it when I snapped it up. The ThinkPad service staff was very attentive. After I bought the pre-installed VISTA system, I changed the operating system in less than 20 minutes. 
0	It’s too annoying to install the driver, the wireless network card driver can’t recognize the wireless network, I don’t know when I can think about it. The camera can’t find the driver, go to the official MSI website, there is no, and the computer can’t find the camera hardware.__ Estimate It's that this one doesn't match it at all! The sound of the optical drive is a bit scary, it's best not to 
0	It's ridiculous. When you check in at this hotel, you have to pay for a bag of pistachios. They can't count the number of their items, and they made a mistake. It is consumers who pay the bill. I would like to ask everyone: do you dare to go to such a place? I chose to resolutely never go again. If I want to rate this hotel, I give it 0 points. The goodwill of their service to customers is completely wiped out by their stupid actions at checkout. Additional comment April 15, 2008: I suggest you Choose other hotels when you arrive in Rizhao, I wish you all a happy stay in Rizhao. 
0	"What kind of electric hotel? ! It's like a private ""car shop"" at all! The service is not generally irregular (except for collection). When I checked into the hotel, I opened the door to see: the paper basket was full, the wash basin was full of sewage, the toilet was also sewage (the toilet was still ""long running water""), and the towels and floor were gray. In the cleaned room, the sink is still full of black oil. The next morning, when we just woke up, the waiter pushed in without knocking the door, saying that he wanted to clean the room. When we left the room, I told the front desk to clean, but when we came back 4 hours later, the room was the same as when we left. The TV and broadband in the room are gone. I went to the reception again, and after waiting for half an hour, no one came...In short, I felt like I was fooled. It is recommended that Ctrip cancel the contract of the hotel, otherwise it may affect its reputation. "
0	Do you want your child to be a humorous person? Do you want your child to be an imaginative person? Do you want to make your children happy and laugh? Carmela is a good choice. Carmela's peculiar thoughts give life a small episode, just like gentle ripples on the calm lake. After getting Carmela, the first thing I enjoyed was myself, and the second was my husband. Then was my two-year-old baby girl. Although she still can't understand the whole storyline, many scenes inside make her very happy. For example, Carmelas pose for fishing in various poses. Egg laying scene. The daughter who has a strong imitative ability also poses various poses, filling the whole family with joy. I think everyone will like Carmela and needs Carmela in life. 
1	The delivery speed is fast, and the product is running at a good speed. When I bought it, I rushed to buy it. The price was 300 yuan lower than the previous day. 
0	It often happens that the memory is exhausted and cannot be released. It seems that there is no cache, it is very cumbersome, and it looks ordinary, and the heat dissipation is still on the right, which is very depressing. After installing xp twice, the system cannot run multiple files, the computer is not very fast, and often crashes. The system has been reinstalled twice. Too depressed. 
0	I don't know how to use the camera. There is not much introduction in the system. In addition, the machine crashed when it was running during the partition, and it could not be restarted for unknown reasons. It succeeded after removing the battery and restarting. Why does it feel so slow to run Vista on 2G? It's a bit unresponsive, and it will be reflected at least 5 seconds after clicking. Are they all like this 
0	The classmate recommended it and said it was very good. Maybe the expectations were too high. After reading it, I was very disappointed. Things written by foreigners don't seem to make much sense in China. 
0	Because it is a well-reviewed book! I bought it! The baby is two years old and three months old, and he usually likes to read books, but this set of books is not touchable! It may be too small! This set of books is not suitable for small children Look!. 
0	I regret buying a set. The description looks like a running account. There are no highlights. If you want to watch it, you can just watch it online. Collection is simply unnecessary. 
0	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in, I suspect that all the comments above are the hotel’s trust, and it is the only four-star hotel in Hengshui. When I first entered the room, there were melon seeds on the floor. The room was very bad and the service attitude was very poor. , There is still a smell in the room. Will never live again. 
1	The appearance is beautiful and the performance is not bad. The first order is 4555, and the refund will be 100 when you watch it in the evening. Re-order immediately. 
0	1. The so-called piano paint is neither abrasion-resistant nor scratch-resistant, and it is easy to leave fingerprints. 2. Changing to XP is very troublesome. 3. The battery life is average. 
0	The room facilities are decent~ But the worst hotel service I have encountered is this hotel, especially the front desk service is simply disgusting! ! First of all, when I checked in, it was unclear. Not only was my attitude indifferent, but also when I used a credit card, I even paid directly for consumption. I couldn't do the prepayment right and didn't even call me. But the most horrible moment has not happened yet, and the experience of checking out made me vomit! ! When I checked out in the morning, there were three people at the front desk. One was chatting on the mobile phone and the other two were chatting. One of them was facing me. I called out and gave her the room card. She actually put the room card on the table. on. Continue to use my butt to chat with the other one, and call the housekeeping department for a round after about a minute after talking about a topic! ! ! Then something more disgusting happened. The front desk who was facing my chat unexpectedly spit out two mouthfuls of sputum on the ground. He didn't even move his back, spitting in front of the guests. For so many years, he stayed in a hotel from Shanghai. Radisson at Zendai went to a small hotel in Gansu, the first time I met! ! ! Finally, I asked her to give me a bill. The content above overlaps and cannot be cleared at all~ Huiyuan, Suzhou, I served U 
0	I booked this hotel because I went to work on Changshou Road, but it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in Shanghai! The hotel is a single building without any beautifying environment such as greenery. Calling a car at the door is super difficult, because the drivers in Shanghai don't stop at this hotel for some reason. They can only be called when a passenger gets off the car at this location. It is really freezing to death at the door! The lobby is on the sixth floor. There is no parking lot downstairs. The basement parking lot is very small. The superior double room is very small and not square. It is a triangular structure. The bed faces the door. It feels very insecure when lying on the bed. When you open the door, you can see people. Could it be that Ctrip can only arrange this room? ! The facilities and equipment of the room are barely three-star. Nearly 600 yuan a night is really not worth it. I will never step into this hotel next time, and I will tell my friends that Shanghai must not stay in this hotel, the price is too low! ! ! 
0	"I have also been watching ""Dulala's Promotion"" during my travel these days. It is indeed a recommended workplace reading. Although they are virtual, many skills can be used in real life. They are not fully used, but they can also be used for reference. After reading it, I found it more useful. "
0	There are many good hotels in Yibin. For example, Xufu Hotel is not bad. I don't know why Ctrip didn't sign this hotel. 
1	I like Professor Lang’s books and speeches. The most persuasive remarks without restraint and pressure are always outspoken when we dare not speak, and they can always point out fatal when we feel that something is wrong. key. The language itself does not need to be modified, unless you want to escape some sensitive things. And Professor Lang's language has always been the most simple and simple, and it is this most primitive language that makes us aware of the most modern problems. Is the hot spot discussed by everyone the hot spot itself? After reading it, you will definitely feel as much as I do. 
1	I booked it for two colleagues and I was quite satisfied, but felt that the price was too high. In such a small western city like this hotel, 300-350 yuan including breakfast is more reasonable. 
1	Although the cases in the book are quite special or exaggerated, I personally still think this is a very useful book. The opinion of this book should be to choose useful information for yourself, there is no need to dispute some boring details or the authenticity of the case. Everyone’s living habits and dietary styles are different. It is impossible that all the plans in the book can be used for you, or all can be used for you. This book is not a heavenly book and it should be expensive. The content is right at this price. Keep a copy at home, useful. 
0	There is an error in the service, the kind of surprise, the room card will be mistaken! 
0	Very ordinary hotel, the special hotel sign on the service counter can not be reflected at all, and the service attitude is also cold. The environment is also quite ordinary, there is no such thing as a seductive appearance in the legend, not worth it 
0	I bought this book because it was affected by sales. After I bought it back, I opened it and saw that it was not a vocabulary that I really wanted to collect. I would also write such a book! 
1	Small, cheap, and easy to carry. When you go out, you can surf the Internet, send emails, etc., enough 
1	"My friend asked me to buy it for her, so I bought a copy and took a look, because I believed her vision. She said she knew this book when she was in high school. When I look at it, besides being surprised, I really want to be on the scene, but after another thought, those of us who are afraid of dogs, I am afraid that we will not reach this state. Just for viewing, ha ha. It was for myself, but I didn't expect children to be very interested, too. Children naturally like animals. There are also many classic remarks, such as: ""Mom, why does your hair look like an ostrich?"" Dumbfounded. "
1	The design is very user-friendly, and it is very comfortable to use; the delivery is very fast, and it will arrive in Shigatse in a week! 
1	The series of Onmyoji is really classic. Although it is said to be the Strange Tales of Chinese Liao Zhai, it still feels very different. The feeling of Onmyoji is very light, but in the light description, it makes people understand a lot of the world. The truth makes people feel calm. My language skills are limited, but I really recommend it! ! Moreover, the layout design and quality of the book are very good. I especially like its layout. The characters are not very large, but the spacing between the characters is relatively large. It looks very comfortable. There is a small picture on the corner of the page below each story. I think the design is very careful. Very good, it is recommended to collect! ! ! 
1	Although this book is not very long, I finished it in two nights as an adult. I was thinking: If I had encountered such a book in my childhood, it would be great! The messages and emotions conveyed in each of this set of international award-winning novels are all about beauty, love, bravery, friendship, tenacity, and sincerity... As a teacher, I now take this The book is recommended to our students. They are at the age of eight or nine. They have a beautiful vision for this world. One more reading and one more true love. I hope this book can give them more than just words. . 
0	"A very unpleasant experience!!! The hotel service is in a mess!!! I checked in at around 3pm and the room was not cleaned! I went through the formalities (paid the deposit), and then got the room card at night. In this way, it was even a big deal for Ctrip Said I did not check in!!! It took more than a week to confirm! The room rate is not advantageous compared to the hotel (very objective! There is no evil) New hotels across the street are everywhere! Except for the big room, everything else is average, special The soundproofing can’t be worse, it’s a great place for people who have time and like to listen to live sex next door! I ""appreciated"" all night! The feeling of ""immersive""!!! Anyway! I will never again Went to this hotel!!! "
0	"I ordered 2 books. Why did I only distribute one? I used the gift certificate, ""The Beauty Sutra of a 31-year-old Little Beauty? This book was not shipped. Order number: 1450990450 can you check it for me? "
0	Because of the difference in cultural background, I feel that this book is more suitable for Western children! The content of the story emphasizes individuality! More self! Although we can treat it more rationally, it is not easy for children to understand. 
0	Linux is pre-installed, and it is troublesome to reinstall XP to install the driver. The screen is not perfect, and there is a red dot on the left side of the screen. Super depressing! 
1	This book is worth reading. It is written in a simple way. There are not so many data and theories, and most people can understand it. Maybe Professor Lang is afraid that we ordinary people will not understand and can't remember, so a lot of content in the book is repeated over and over again. Said endlessly. The main point of view is fiduciary responsibility. In fact, a lot of the dual economy has been mentioned in his lectures. I came up with this book, as he said, he must consider his own pension issues. In the end, I still support what he said, because few people can speak so directly and thoroughly. 
1	The built-in camera saves the trouble of external connection. The machine can cope with general applications. The matte hand feels very good. The machine is very light. It feels much better than my previous Dell D430. 
0	This hotel is simply terrible! The environment is very old, a bit far from the city! Living in it is a large number of travel agency teams, messy. The price of surfing the Internet will scare you to death! I am very dissatisfied with Ctrip's priority recommendation of this hotel, and I definitely gave more rebates. It is better to live in the Home Inn Business Hotel opposite the railway station, and the Internet is free! I don't know how Ctrip did it! I don’t recommend my own joint venture hotel, so I build this broken hotel. 
1	Cost-effective. Delivery is super fast (the order placed yesterday at 3 pm will be delivered the next morning.) Great, the goods are very new. The production date is 0905, and the original inventory has disappeared. 
1	The arrangement of this set of books is very good. My little guy has fallen in love with this set since I bought the first one. He likes the content of the book very much. With his interest from 2 to 6 years old, the little guy is now 5 years old and 5th grade. The later he has to do the questions, the longer and the more difficult it is. I personally like this set of numbers. The content of each volume is very targeted and helpful for children's learning. 
0	I have bought the DVD of Cat and Mouse more than 10 times on Dangdang.com. In addition to giving as a gift to relatives and friends, some children, I also leave it to watch for myself, and I will never tire... 
1	The location is good, the room is small but clean, suitable for business activities. 
0	Lived once in 2007 and it feels okay. I feel bad this time. The quilt and bed sheets are too, too, and too old, and it's time to get new ones. Other service industries are general. 
1	All IBMX series pursue fashion and perfection. The LED screen has all the major functions. In fact, I want Linux, but if this configuration is good, I need to install another Linux. 
1	The sound quality is good, and the battery life is also good. 3dmax2001 ran for more than 14,000 points and I don't know what it will look like after adding memory. 
0	"Henan people are Henan people! If you don't be fooled once, it is considered a timeless one; in the whole country and even the whole world, the room called economic room is called ""VIP Building"" in Jiyuan, Henan Province, which is really funny! ! ! "
0	Very unpleasant stay. My friend arrived at around 11:30 in the evening. At this time, there was only 1 person at the counter, and there were only 3 people in the lobby including the waiter. Because they were older, they wanted the waiter to help with their luggage. After beckoning, they ignored it and ran. open. When I checked in, I even swiped two credit cards and even said that the credit card is not available, which is very inexplicable. The facilities of the room are very poor, the lights are very dark, and the things in the hotel are very shabby, which really detracts from the 5-star standard. No wonder friends would say that there are very few guests in this hotel and they are scared away. It's really shameful to be still near the bustling Nanjing Road. 
1	The cost performance is relatively high. I like the 15-inch feeling. The 160G hard disk is enough. The colleagues from the combo company are also very satisfied. 
1	The child really likes this book. I also often buy some good books that are highly reviewed or recommended by friends. Children like to read them. However, according to the process of observing children reading this book, I found that this is a book that makes children very excited. During the festival, everyone was shouting and shouting on the ground excitedly. I asked why it was because the book was too good to read, and I really liked the claws. Bravery and fearlessness are the evaluation of the characters in the book. And I don’t even watch TV, I watch it whenever I have time, and I put the book under my pillow. Yes, although I haven't read it, I feel that it must be a very attractive book for children. 
1	Beautiful, generous, not easy to stick fingerprints, good heat dissipation, good luck, it is a perfect screen, and the Lenovo outer packaging is not opened, and the sound is very soft when it runs. I always thought that Jingdong would open it for inspection. It didn’t happen this time, haha, happy, and now the official XP driver for V450 has also come out. Apart from the process and time spent installing XP, no difficult problems have been encountered. The system has been adapted to the environment by itself, except for the wireless network card. And the card reader has not been verified, the rest are all working well, with only some minor flaws. Date of delivery of the machine: April 18, 2009 
0	Even 128m of video memory is good, but not. It is best to have accessories for sale and detailed operation methods. For example, remove the optical drive and install a second hard drive. I think many people will like it. 
1	"The author used ""hug"" before the war, which is amazing. If Japan is not defeated, there will be American occupation, without the continuation of Hu bureaucracy, without post-war civil development reflection, without ~, Japan will not be allowed to become an economic power. Of course, the Americans also brought shame to the Japanese. It has also had a profound impact on Japan-China relations. The article exposes many little-known things in the ""Tokyo Trial"". Arousing people. Ugh! Does the Chinese people know too little about Japan? "
0	It’s a bit thicker. The screen’s clarity is a bit worse than other brands. The mouse buttons on the fuselage don’t feel good. The 1024X600 display rate is still a bit smaller. If you use 1024X768 compressed display, the speed will be better. A lot slower. 
1	Overall, it was OK, but the front desk staff was not dedicated enough. After checking in, I didn't see if it was me, so I gave my guest's passport to other people. Fortunately, I was right next to me. Otherwise, I didn't know what the consequences would be. Sorry, or sorry for nothing!!! Hope to improve!!! 
1	It is sold at special price and is very affordable. The current price of 4488 is without a bag. The exterior design is high-grade. The interior and exterior are all black piano lacquer with metal dark lines. It is much more beautiful than the picture. It is exquisite and elegant. Friends like it. The performance is not bad 6400.2G.250G.9300 alone, and the LED screen, the effect is super good, my colleagues say it is as bright as a mirror, ha ha. And it should be relatively power-saving, the battery is SONY, the quality is good. The mouse in the box is original Lenovo, not delivered, and the quality feels good. The Lenovo bag is of good workmanship, and it is indeed genuine, better than the high copy in the store. 
0	Many of Jingdong’s product descriptions are wrong. The 320g hard drive is written to 250. The system vista 1g memory is very slow. 
0	"I arrived at Lanzhou Railway Station at 12 o'clock in the evening. After I got off the train, I asked three passers-by who didn’t know there was the hotel. Finally, we chose to take a taxi. Because it was far away from the railway station, it cost 11 yuan. Friends at the transfer station are best to choose other hotels. Maybe because of the remoteness of the hotel lobby at night, even if the car stopped at the door of the hotel, it took us 5 minutes to find the entrance of the main door. When registering, the waitress actually asked ""We have breakfast here, do you need it?"" I asked her if the room does not include breakfast, and her answer was yes. At that time, I was very surprised that she asked me why Would you like breakfast? We entered the room at 12:30. At that time, we found that the weather was very cold and there were only two quilts in the whole room. So we called the front desk and asked for one more quilt, maybe because it was too late. If I said no, I said it was too cold to ask her for help. She said that she could ask for me but she could do nothing if not. My feeling at the time was that the service of this hotel was too reluctant. In the end, of course, her reply was gone. I didn’t want to say anything to her. When I arrived at 8 o’clock the next morning, I went to the 2nd floor and ate the breakfast that I have seen the least food in my life. Up. We booked rooms through Ctrip for 12 days before and after this trip. We stayed in Ningxia-Gansu-Qinghai. In general, I feel the worst in all aspects of this hotel. I can't feel the service at all and I have to be angry. Additional comments October 9, 2007: I think the price of 330 yuan is totally unreasonable. "
1	Point: The all-black appearance is suitable for men, it looks good, the workmanship is good, the keyboard, battery, fan are all satisfied 
0	Slow check-in and check-out, slow elevator, broken supermarket, old rooms, poor service attitude! 
0	Lenovo destroyed the IBM brand, and the quality is too bad! As soon as I got the goods, I found the whole LCD display was yellowish. 
0	The CD-ROM reading sound is too loud, but fortunately, it does not affect the use. I encountered a problem when installing the system, and the GHOST could not be installed. In the BIOS, change the icha to IDE. Later, I used the rain forest tree to enter the WINPE and then the GHOST was completed in it. I wonder if you have a good way. 
1	After using it for half a month, I haven't found any bad conditions so far, and I feel pretty good overall. Under the same configuration, this price is really affordable... 
0	The machine is really hot...The screen has no snaps, so I am not used to it. 
0	I feel very disappointed. This book is so popular. But it is not what I want. The author is a blogger. It is his freedom to write. But the book should be published with rigorous chapters. The source is well cited. Otherwise, how can you be worthy of the reader? See in In my eyes, I can only think of this comment-I have the desire to write novels. I don't have the ability to write history. 1. In Zhu Yuanzhang's life, how important roles Liu Ji and Hu Weiyong are. But in this book, the so-called resourceful Liu Ji. The author only wrote about the so-called Battle of Anfeng. And it was just two sentences from Liu Ji admonishing Zhu Yuanzhang not to attack. In this way, Liu Ji’s miraculous plan could be positioned? What about other battles. What about other tactics. Where is Liu Ji’s role? Hu Weiyong writes more. But what about his evil appearances. What about his use of tactics? They are all in one stroke. Compared with his description of war scenes. That is really insignificant. 2. The author's strength is obviously war scenes. And some short stories. Although I still quote ancient texts. I also help us translate. But I don’t think the general direction has been set. The important protagonist group configuration weight is not well grasped. Many events are just a light stroke. It can be seen that the references are insufficient 3. The tone of writing Of course it can be the author’s own style. The author reinterpreted the chaotic history of Ming Dynasty in modern buzzwords. But the author has repeatedly tried to describe the mood in the first person. But it is sensational and spends a long chapter... He can only say... A book should be a novel 
0	Because of price constraints, the overall machine is still heavy and not very convenient to carry. You still need to flash the BIOS to install XP, otherwise the sound card driver will have problems. I have already flashed XP, then flashed back to Vista, the partitioning is still convenient, and Vista's built-in functions can be done. 
1	The price is cheaper and the workmanship is stronger than the previous model with a unique display, but the plastic traces are still too heavy. The sense of technology is not strong. Maybe my request is too high. The screen is not point. Haha. Good RP 
0	This is almost the best hotel in Jiangyin, and many foreigners live here. The size of the room is okay, the decoration and facilities don't feel like a five-star standard, it's about the same as a four-star. The most unbearable thing is the parking lot of this hotel. I went there on an ordinary day, and it turned out that someone got married in a hotel. The underground and the ground were full of cars of people attending wedding banquets. As a result, the people who stayed in our store had to park their cars far away across the road. It was still raining that day. There was a Frenchman, a Filipino, and two Chinese in my car who had to carry their luggage and braved the rain to escape one puddle after another to the hotel lobby. The security guard at the door seemed to have taken no surprises at this situation, and looked blankly at the four of us jumping around. It sucks. 
0	I placed an order to buy on March 24, but yesterday the text message told me that the delivery was beyond the scope of delivery and no delivery. Now the money has been paid, and I still don’t know if I can get the things. Call back and say I don’t know about this, no Know what Dangdang. What courier I found, really bad! The customer service line is always busy, I don’t know what I am doing. Can anyone tell me when I can get the book!!! 
0	It was ok before, this time I went, the carpets in the room were dark, very dirty, the buffet was unpalatable, the number of waiters was less than the number of managers, and the whole hotel seemed to be closed. 
0	This hotel is too dark and requires broadband access. The waiter sends a network cable and asks you to sign. There is no text. 
1	Because of work, I will live every month. It is the best choice around 400 in Jinhua City. The service is very good, the breakfast is good, and it is close to the city center. The decoration style of the 360 standard room is slightly old but still clean and tidy .Highly recommended. The front desk service feels good every time I am praised. 
1	Early, the hotel environment is very good. But Dingshan Tower is still far from the main building 
0	Thinkpad's partitioning is reasonable or an old problem. The rear shell of the fuselage is a bit deformed. The front touch screen side shell is not firm. 
0	A lot of the content of the article is something I haven't seen before, I have thought of it, and it is practical! But the level of the translator is really not very good, especially when it comes to person conversion that makes people dizzy. It is recommended that Dangdang can have the original (English version) to buy. 
1	The only downside is that the wall charts are not easy to check. They often have to be viewed from both sides, and the directions are also inconsistent, making it difficult to check. 
0	The hotel is very old, small and dark in the corridors. It is actually a small hotel. It is recommended not to go, the hotel in Jilin Province is not bad. 
1	1. It is a small surprise to see the cpu information from cmos shows N280 instead of 270. 2. XPH has been patched with sp3, using magicset, the patch is basically complete. 3. There are some commonly used software: mcafee antivirus software, office2007 trial version. 
0	"The display screen is not clear enough, it is gray under a white background, like frosted glass, not white, there are countless snowflakes or horizontal stripes on the entire screen. Commonly known as ""Snowflake Screen"". The result of the optimization master test is: AUO brand screen, the manufacturing date is: the first week of 2006. "
1	I remember watching one more TV series called Xue Linglong, which has the same meaning as this book. It was also a child who had a terminal illness and gave birth to another as a medication. At that time, I thought about ethical issues. The ending of this book is that the second child died suddenly and gave the kidney to the first child, very suddenly. The book is written from different perspectives of each person. It was a bit confusing at first, but then it got better. There are also stories from other people in it, which is not bad. The mother inside is very persistent, the father is basically normal, the lawyer is also very interesting, even the dog named the judge is also very funny. 
0	The day before I bought the package, and the day after I bought it, the package was given, that is, I did not send the package on the day I bought it. I was depressed, depressed, depressed, and I did not send it again. Continue...depressed, depressed, depressed. 
0	I wanted to look through it when I was okay, but unfortunately I couldn’t stand it. It’s still incomparable with Zhang. Most of his books sell well because of Zhang’s influence. I really don’t like this man. I don’t know how to buy it. I regret it. 
0	It seems more moldy. 1. Place an order on June 14th, pay on the 16th, and can't wait for Shanghai Zhongtong to pick it up on the 25th. Delivery is nearly 10 days! 2. I don't know whether it is a driver problem or a machine problem. Once the touchpad is opened, it will always right-click. The same applies to LINUX and XP. You can only use the mouse now. 3. The system is not XP. 
1	hp 6535B (VA051PA) Brand new. I bought it on JD. It had an invoice. It was sold at a loss due to urgent need. The invoice dated June 1, 2009, with complete packaging. 13774321320 Mr. Li (No. 63, Chifeng Road, Shanghai) 
0	I was quite angry after reading this book. I have never seen such a shameless man! But for Zhang Ailing, this book is still worth buying 
0	The appearance of the hotel is good! After entering, everything becomes very complicated! Maybe the entertainment venue is too convenient. The in and out are all ladies and moms (7 or 8 o'clock in the evening). The hair salon at the back is a bit exaggerated, right? We must not let the ladies think that we often live in this hotel! The environment of the hotel at noon and morning is OK! Is the hotel room floor okay? But the occupants who opened the door and played cards made the whole corridor smell very heavy! And there are many people entering and leaving the floor of the room, and it feels a bit unsafe. 
0	I bought a book that I read at the time, but I didn’t like it very much after reading it. Personally, everyone has different feelings when reading the book. 
1	I watched it all night, and it was really exciting. The quality of the book was definitely worth it. At first glance, I felt that the paper quality was not that good. But after seeing the real pirated version, I knew that the real book was still very good! 
1	The geographical position is superior, the transportation is convenient, the hotel environment is good, the service is excellent, and the laundry is fast. 
0	I booked a night for a guest from abroad. When I left the restaurant the next day, the guest said that the dinner was eaten in the hotel restaurant and the stomach was upset. But I had to catch a plane and sent it to the airport lounge and vomited and diarrhea. When I arrived in Bangkok, I was admitted to the hospital. I stayed for two days, unaccompanied in Thailand. The next business trip was cancelled and I went back to the United States from Bangkok. It made me feel guilty and worried. You are also considered Shanghai 4 stars. Level? Note: They have entered the country for 3 weeks. This is the last day. It will not be unacceptable! The hotel feedback August 13, 2008: We attach great importance to the situation you reported. Our hotel is a foreign-related four-star hotel. The operating regulations for guest rooms and catering are quite strict. The preservation of food raw materials and food processing in the hotel's Chinese and Western restaurants are very professional. Since the hotel opened, there has never been a complaint of discomfort caused by food. But we still apologize for what happened to our guests! Hope he can recover soon! 
0	The one with the battery management installed does not turn on the best effect, there will be some cards~~~ And I bought it in less than 3 days, it dropped by 200~~~Cry~~~ 
1	The environmental facilities are quite good, especially the guards at the door are very safe, worthy of the state guesthouse in Jilin Province. I live in the main building, but the corresponding price is relatively high. I personally think that the main building is not much different from the seven buildings. In fact, it is a 3-star standard in the south. The waiters are very enthusiastic, but the hardware I can only give me 3 points. 
0	The facilities are not bad, but a guest house. My towel was hung in the bathroom, and when I needed it, I found bed bugs crawling on it. Can only throw it away. The restaurant price is also high, a scrambled egg with green onions costs 25 yuan, other dishes can be imagined. The location is good, the service attitude is okay, and you can swipe your card all the way. 
0	The weight is a little heavier, the screen is not mirrored, and the screen is widened and a bit bigger. The 12-inch screen on the mold should not be a problem 
0	The price of Ctrip is 360 yuan per room, and I see that other customers who check out at the same time are 298 yuan. Ctrip told me that it was four stars. What I saw was a worse room than Jinjiang Inn. The paint peeled off in the elevator and the stainless steel pipe in the bathroom was rusted. There must be no star rating. The place is also in an alley. I live in room 1512. The only thing is that Koreans come and go frequently. It is recommended that Ctrip negotiate with the hotel. I have already complained to the lobby, and such a room is not worth the price of 360 yuan. Ctrip should go to the hotel to conduct an on-site survey before recommending it to guests. 
1	Where was the concierge when I checked in? The flower pots in the room were very ugly like those in the early 90s. What's more frightening was that when I checked in, I didn't care about the guests at the door, and we would do extensive cleaning as usual. 
1	Small, light, and reasonable configuration, different from ordinary netbooks with a six-cell battery, it can be used as fast as 6 hours, very good 
0	Why should Vista be pre-installed? Only divided into two zones, C drive 160G...this is quite damning... 
1	It’s much lighter than my 14-inch Asus, and it’s not too much to put in a bag. The battery time is longer. If you go out to watch movies or work at night, you don’t need to bring an adapter. 
1	The sea view is good, which is the best in Weihai. The service is okay, but it didn't impress. The facilities in the room are not bad, but they are in good condition, which is worse than the Blue Sky Hotel. I think the breakfast is not much better than the 38, but it costs 68 yuan. The soundproofing of the room is very poor. I checked in a few people next door and started singing and then playing cards. I heard very clearly. 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
1	Strong endurance! The appearance is also good, it is very light and it runs faster than most of the brand netbooks I have seen before 
0	Generally speaking, the impression of Dengfeng is relatively poor, which is basically a typical of dirty, messy and poor! The hotel’s facilities are extremely rudimentary, there is no shower curtain in the bathroom, and a shower is full of water! Moreover, there is no place to hang clothes. The restaurant in the hotel was already blacked out before 7 o'clock. In short, a rather dark and old hotel, and the condition is very average. However, the location is good, opposite is a supermarket, and there is a snack street. 
0	With 1024*600 screen, many programs are awkward to use. The machine is a bit heavy, and the game speed is almost too fast. 
1	T4200, 1GB (Samsung DDR2 800), 160G (Western Digital), DVD burner (Hitachi LG), it runs quietly and does not generate much heat 
1	In addition to Apple, I like the design of ThinkPad. Classic appearance, good price/performance ratio, and balanced configuration in all aspects. My favorite is its own camera. My colleague is a relatively careless person, so he didn't pick him up with a hardworking machine like Xiao Hei. 
1	I started to book a single room for a large room, but I went to the hotel and told me that there was no Ctrip reservation. I was about to call to inquire and told me that there was another one. Go and see, the room is too small to fit a bed. So I retired and booked a business executive suite. The suites are not bad, the rooms are big, the facilities are always good, but the price is a bit expensive. The overall feeling is average. 
1	The machine brought the VISTA HOME BASIC version, but it was formatted after the purchase, and the XP system was changed. The installation process went smoothly. The memory is a single 2G Samsung DDR3 1066 sliver. I installed the YMLF9.9 system. After the GHOST was good, the system recognized it, and the graphics card recognized it as G98, and I ran 3D MARK2001, with more than 15,000 points. And the official ACER driver was updated, and I recognized that the G 105M score is only 14,000 points anyway, which is more than a thousand less, hey! Can't figure it out. The camera is really not so clear. 
1	The price is right, the screen is good, and the heat dissipation is good. I don’t feel very hot all morning, especially in summer. 
0	The internet fee of one dollar per minute is amazingly expensive. Of the three doors, only the middle revolving door was open, and the others were sealed (for unknown reasons). There was no doorman to push the door or pick up my luggage. Only two hands took the luggage and kicked the door around. Breakfast is horrible. I wanted to order for lunch, but was told that only buffets are available. Put the bath towel in the bathtub and hope to change it. At night, I saw hair on the changed bath towel. I hope the lady just folded the towel in the bathtub and put it back on the towel rack, otherwise it would be really disgusting. I really don’t know why this four-star hotel is inferior to the local three-star hotel. It is better to find a business hotel in this hotel. 
1	This book is not thick, but it takes some effort to read it all. Xu You Tang Yongtong's son, Tang Yijie said, father and son are both academic dignitaries. Mr. Tang Yongtong is very accomplished in the study of Buddhism. It is said that he personally studied Sanskrit in order to have a deeper understanding of the essentials of Buddhist scriptures, and then wrote his own pen to translate. The old man's academic attitude has always been respectful. This book was originally a lecture draft of my husband, and was later compiled into a book. It is a good channel to understand Wei Jin metaphysics. Although the book is not thick, it has a lot of content, which shows that Mr.'s scholarship is extensive. 
1	I finished reading Professor Lang's book in one sitting, which is very easy to understand. The book uses considerable data to illustrate the problem, which is worth thinking about. In contrast, the news media collectively report that the economic situation has recovered, this book is even more commendable. I suggest everyone read it. China should not be the first to emerge from the crisis. On the contrary, it is possible that everyone has gone through the crisis and we are still in the crisis. It is recommended that government officials who are clamoring for growth all the time should take a closer look, and do not spend taxpayers' money all day long in the name of infrastructure construction. 
0	This is the second time to stay, because it is very close to the customer, it is convenient. Let me talk about the first time I checked in. The air conditioner was not cold and the room was like a sauna. I classified it as a problem of luck and ignored it, but the internet speed was so slow that it could only be described as unbelievably slow. China Telecom's broadband service in this hotel is actually slower than dial-up Internet access. I am an eye-opener. Let me say the second time, starting from the checkin, I decided not to come to this hotel for the third time. The male employee at the front desk should not say anything, plus a nonchalant tone, asking for three sentences. I barely returned a few words, I thought, maybe it's the boss's son, otherwise I really can't think of the reason why the hotel uses this kind of staff. The chef in the breakfast cooking area didn’t know how to educate. He always hid and wanted to get a bowl of noodles. After standing for a long time, he couldn’t see anyone. The lady at the service counter just pretended not to see me. I hope that one thing is worse than one thing less. The room equipment is normal this time. It's so easy to drive away a guest. There is no way to find or manage the inapplicable employees, that is the problem of hotel management. I can only say that if your hotel feels that you don't want to be a four-star hotel at all, then I apologize for my fault. I also apologize to the vast majority of dedicated employees. 
0	This hotel sucks. The lobby is noisy, the room equipment is outdated, and the carpets, toilets and beds are dirty. My child slept all night and there were many red peas (due to mites) on his face. Calling to the customer service department, almost no effective service. It doesn't match the star rating at all. It is strongly recommended that Ctrip delete this hotel from the reservation list. 
0	Other configurations are pretty good, but 1G memory is definitely not enough to run VISTA. The genuine system does not contain the VISTA CD, which is unacceptable. 
1	The price is relatively affordable, and it looks pretty flattering. There is no fragile label on the upgrade bin. I wonder if it encourages upgrades? Or forgot to post it? ? There is a good seal on the box. 
1	The lobby environment of the hotel has improved compared to before, possibly because of the arrangement of flowers. The facilities in the room are clean, fresh and comfortable. 
0	It’s a bit heavy, and it’s too tiring to carry on to and from get off work; there is also the system, which is really annoying, just a C drive partition, I have found many ways to partition, but the system is still broken and the backup is not done. used. NND only has to get the service point, and it has to spend two hundred dollars to change the system. 
1	I have been using it for more than 2 months. The performance is good and stable. If it is fast, I think it will be more difficult at this price. But it can be said that this portable has all the necessary memory, and the memory is a little less, so I also replaced a 2G memory stick. The processor speed of the P8400 is not bad, all the functional parts are very easy to use, and it is very light, now I go there and hold it. The 160G hard disk is still enough, and it is recommended to put large items on the mobile hard disk. I bought a 9-cell battery, which has excellent battery life and can reach 7-8 hours of normal operation. The standard 4-cell battery can only last for more than 2 hours. 
0	The Vista system is not easy to use. I installed it as XP. I don’t know why it’s a bit chromatic and unnatural. It’s okay in general~ It shouldn’t be a problem with the system installation. 
0	Very bad! 1. We chartered a car to tour the West Lake through its business center. The car drove us to buy tea at an irregular scenic spot (we bought it), and then suddenly said that there was something at home in the middle of the trip, and finally stopped the chartered service. Can you imagine the feeling of being left behind in an unfamiliar place in life? - Later, the business center apologized that the driver was thinking about going home to play mahjong! 2. The guest room consumption instructions are manually altered, which is very easy to mislead-the hotel later admitted this and said that it will be corrected in the future, but the misleading consumption still forces the customer to bear it! - Standard small farmer-conscious management ‘hotel’! It is recommended that you book a regular/international/chain hotel. There are usually misunderstandings/unclear points, and the interests of the customers are the best! Hotel feedback July 10, 2008: The hotel attaches great importance to your question. The hotel business center is an outsourcing unit of the hotel. This has adversely affected the hotel. In order to prevent the recurrence of such things, the hotel has to contract the business center Criticized and punished, and the business center fired the driver. In addition, the hotel bill has been changed, thank you for your comments! 
1	Actually, this is not a successful picture book. A really good picture book should be based on pictures. Even if the text is removed, the pictures can tell stories. But this one is not because the pictures are not beautiful, but Because its text is so touching, it has surpassed the beauty of the picture~ Even if you don’t look at the picture and just read the text, you’re already satisfied. This story is perfect. Therefore, even if it is judged from strict picture book requirements, it is not considered successful, but what does it matter? This story is enough. This story is a story that hits the heart. 
0	The network card is too rubbish. Except for windows 7 vista, I don't want to use it by accident. The driver simply doesn't exist. The xp driver is not officially provided 
1	"What I like most about this book is the phrase ""If life is like first time"". That is the name of this book. If life is just like seeing it for the first time, all the past will turn into a smile. Only the surprise and love at first sight will remain. Forget the betrayal, sorrow, helplessness and grief you may have had. What a wonderful state of life this is. Time flies, we can't go back to the past, maybe we fell in love at first sight, but when we meet again, it might be a sad time. If so, it's not as good as the feeling when I first saw it...This book not only introduces poetry, but also makes me feel the beautiful love of ancient times~! "
1	I learned a lot of rules and survival methods of foreign companies, and many things have broadened my horizons, as if I had been trained once. I like Lara's character, humorous, kind, and smart. Her clear thinking is something I admire very much and it is worth learning. I have been looking for my own direction, and through this book, I have opened some of my ideas, such as obtaining financial freedom, such as achieving early retirement... We who are still struggling, need to continue to cheer! Recommend this book to my friends, I believe they will like it too. I believe it will be equally useful to students who are new to the workplace! 
1	Nice hotel, one of the best in Liuzhou. The surrounding environment is also very good. 
0	I haven't read the details yet. The quality of the book is so bad that it can't even be counted as pirated! There are missing pages, and some even a whole page is exposed! ! I was disappointed when I bought it for the first time! ! 
0	Basically a hotel with poor hardware and acceptable service. On the first night of staying, the air vent of the air conditioner was not installed properly, and there was a sound of metal crashing. It was not loud, but it was enough to make me struggle ideologically in bed overnight to ask someone to fix it. In short, I didn't sleep well. The bathroom is very narrow and the lights are dim. You have to turn on the bathroom heater to make it brighter. None of the towels did not shed hair. It is estimated that they have been used since the time of the planned economy. Washing for so many years is not easy enough. Fortunately, the bedding is very clean. The furniture is very old. Good service, check-in and check-out are fast. The doorman looked at us with a bunch of salutes and walked into the store with almost provocative eyes, and went to the front desk to check in. No greetings, no help. Uh, as the old man mentioned before, the elevator is really inconvenient. The three elevators are scattered and linked, and there is a corner in the middle, which makes them run back and forth with bad luck. Never stay here. Uh, there is a street in the back, and the door of a family that makes fat sausage is a bit bigger. The food is not delicious. The dishes on the table contain plastic ropes. 
0	The keyboard feel hasn’t been better when it started. The heat dissipation is average, and the hard disk temperature of the machine once reached 58 degrees. 
0	"Among the nearly 100 3-star hotels I have stayed in for more than 10 years, the service, rooms and catering of this hotel are simply ""good"" and nothing to say! ! ! Report the problem to the lobby manager, and the lobby manager's reply is ""Go to 315 to complain"" (the check-in day is March 12), so powerful! ! ! "
0	1. I have been on the Internet for a long time, but I can’t get there. I asked the hotel and the answer was broken. Angry! 2. Checking in at night happened when the weather changed. The weather became cold. After turning on the air conditioner for a long time, it was still cold. Ask the hotel, and the answer was to turn off the air conditioner at night. gosh! There was only one quilt on the bed, and I looked for quilts everywhere, none. I asked the hotel to call me three times in half an hour. It was still cold, and asked for an extra quilt. The waiter never returned after he went. He called the reception desk and waited for a long time, but the quilt was gone. Don't treat customers as human beings. 3. I didn't sleep in the whole night, and was awakened by a low roar that didn't know where it came from at 5 o'clock in the morning. After searching the room for a long time, I didn't find out where the sound was coming from, and called the waiter. The waiter came after six o'clock, and it couldn't be solved. Just stayed up all night. Buying gas is accepted. 4. I went to the main station and asked the manager on duty to explain. I changed a few people and said it several times. The hotel continued to implement the truth of the matter. Finally, a self-proclaimed customer service manager came and said something happened. He apologized and did something. After hours of cold bench, I didn't drink any hot water and my mouth was dry. This is their sincerity. Summary: The hardware is old and the service is poor. 
0	The hotel does not reach the five-star standard. High price, poor environment, average service 
1	When I first bought the book, I never expected that my son would like this book so much. In the past six months or so, he has read it early and late. So I had to buy another one. Let him read freely most of the time, and occasionally practice dialogue with him. Perhaps it is more suitable for his preferences. Basically, he completed his self-study with great interest, and tried to use the sentence patterns and expressions in his daily life. For him, it is definitely worth the money. He was about 7 years old when he started to read this book. Because he already had some English vocabulary and reading basics, he could accept it well. 
1	The International Hotel could not book a room, so I booked this with a try. It feels very good and the environment is good, especially the bed and quilt, which are really comfortable and much better than the international ones. The only drawback is that the location is a bit off 
0	For girls in their twenties, I personally feel that the content of this book is not suitable, some are too simple, and a bit tacky, and it takes less than ten minutes to read it. 
0	I liked this book... after I sent it... I found that the crease on the cover was particularly serious. . . It’s also inside... I’m very disappointed... don’t do this next time. 
1	In short, it is definitely a good book for people who know little about Chinese medicine, and it may be more general to people who learn Chinese medicine. The book has its own golden house. 
0	The hotel is by the river in Sha Tin with a nice view. However, it seems that the attitude of the waiters is very bad because they are all mainlanders. I asked them to ask for internet access at night, and a waiter tricked me to buy an internet card outside, and later ignored me when complaining. 
1	It feels good, it's a nice hotel, and I plan to stay there next month for errands. 
0	I just stayed in August, I advise everyone not to stay in this state-owned enterprise. The room attendant is extremely scary. Before the check-out time at 12 noon, the magnetic card in your room was cancelled, and the personal belongings are still in the room. They settled after a big fight, and they called Ctrip for help, wasting a lot of time. Additional comment September 18, 2006: Breakfast was not very good 
0	Although the reservation is more convenient, the hotel's care for customers is insufficient, and the room is so cold that people can't sleep. The service staff also said that it is warm! ! ! Hotel feedback May 4, 2008: First of all, thank you for staying at Huibin Building and asking us questions. Due to the high altitude of Mount Wutai, the climate is humid and the temperature difference is large, the hotel is closed in winter, the temperature of the room may be a little cool at night after opening The hotel apologizes for the inconvenience caused. 
0	It is the LINUX system, it will not be used. There are only two USBs, and the built-in driver only supports VISTA, so you have to download it online. 
0	"After reading the chapter of Brothers' grievances in ""The Law of Fairness"", I want to say that ""one slap can't make a sound"". Sun Yingui is defending himself and redressing his grievances, but it makes viewers feel disgusted. Boss Sun has the money to use 15 million yuan to speculate this book, why can't he wait to sell himself Tianjin Bailong Company! "
1	The content is very different from the previous Yishu novels. There are many suspense, and the heroine's fate is too miserable. There is no parent to rely on. The original beloved degenerates into a devil when he encounters a financial blow. The friends who lend a hand have other plans. , And got into an affair with the husband of a friend again, until he realized that the crisis had been extinguished. I can see that the cold sweat is coming out, and I feel that the heroine lacks determination to some extent, and has a weak temperament. She wants to entrust the future to live a stable life before she can see it thoroughly. Unfortunately, things are often very different after a slow beat. . Poor blessing. 
1	The hotel is large in scale and there is no room for service staff on the floor, so no waiter can be found; the room is cold (especially on the first floor), so be sure to book the second floor or higher when booking. 
1	The advantage is that this machine is cheap and does not have an operating system, which is a trouble. Fortunately, if you know a little computer knowledge, you have to be pissed off if you don’t understand computers. First of all, it looks like the south bridge chip used by this machine, and what sata. What is the interface lock? General pirated disks are not installed directly. Every time you choose to install, you will get an error. You can only download the version that supports South Bridge, but I prefer WINPE so I still use my pe to install it, but I don’t recognize it. When I got to the C drive, I was very depressed. Later I found that it needed another integrated version of pe to show the c drive. 
0	The room layout is simple, the bed and quilt feel cheap, the air conditioner is extremely cold and the temperature is not well adjusted, so I can only turn it off before going to bed, but I still have a cold because of this, and the breakfast quality is very average. I will not go again in the future. . 
1	Older hotels, rooms and other facilities are also older, the service is still OK 
1	The choice was wrong just now. . Khan~ The mood index should have benefited a lot~ 
0	The laptop bag and the mouse are not equipped. There is also the laptop’s heat sink on the right. The mouse will become hot if you hold the mouse in your right hand for a long time. 
1	The room I gave for the first time was on the ground floor, with the window facing the bar. Changed to the front desk request. The front desk has a good attitude. On the third floor, the windows are generally blocked by the building in front of the corridor, and the other half faces the roof of the bar. The room is small, the software should reach a three-star level, and the hardware is slightly poor. The air conditioner is not well controlled and it is extremely hot, ha ha. The carpet is a bit dirty. Go out and turn left 50 meters to the subway station. It is also convenient to take a taxi from Dongsishitiao. The location is good. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is decent in Beijing. The taste of the restaurant is also good, and the price is reasonable. 
0	This hotel disappointed me too much, the room is so small that it can't be smaller and the service attitude is generally ok except for the rooftop swimming pool, it is better to stay at the sea view hotel, which is close to the Tin Hau station and the price is cheap. I will definitely not stay in Hong Kong next time this home 
1	I must have read the book of Sun Ruixue more than once. As a lecturer at Sun Ruixue's educational institution, I have also listened to her lectures many times. It should be said that this book is the result of her years of research on child psychology, and the language is easy to understand, easy to understand, and operable. The examples of other parents’ teaching children in the book are particularly inspiring to me. It can be said to be a mirror. Through the behavior of other parents’ teaching children, I can see my shortcomings. There are still many areas to improve. 
1	Very good machine, surprising workmanship, beautiful appearance, including the design of the lighting system is very user-friendly, the machine configuration is balanced, overall the configuration is not bad, running Vista is smoother than I thought, I have been using XP before, never used After using Vista, I originally planned to switch to XP if it didn't work, but after using it, I found that Vista is also very easy to use. The dual-channel 2G DDR1066 memory of this machine can completely ensure the smooth operation of Vista, so I don't plan to change to XP! The CPU graphics card is also sufficient, and the interface is very complete. Overall, I am very satisfied! 
1	This book's introduction to Zhejiang is quite comprehensive, and the style is a bit similar to the lonely planet series, but obviously it is still insufficient. Perhaps it is because it is comprehensive, but the introduction to the key scenes seems a bit thin. Therefore, there are still many shortcomings in the application, but it should already be a pretty good one among similar products. I hope that the introduction of the allusions to the scenic spots will be strengthened. It might be better if it is similar to the Frommer's series. I personally hope that I can visit the relevant scenic spots in depth without a guide, and learn about some history and culture. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, compact and easy to carry. XP is installed after receiving it. It is recommended that you install it with an external optical drive. It is much simpler. 
0	The heat dissipation of the machine is not particularly ideal, and the bottom heats up! The pre-installed linux system, reinstalling the xp system is more laborious, but there are many online tutorials, and you will be able to explore it! The battery is not very durable, only about two hours, the power supply still has to be carried with you, if you are not careful, there will be no electricity! 
1	"The service is very good and fast, but the hardware facilities are too old, the bathroom smells, and it is currently being renovated, and the sound of the machine starting at 7 am disturbs the dream. But at the checkout, the front desk took the initiative to consult, and apologize, very user-friendly service, and take the initiative to let guests in the elevator, very good service. The breakfast is very Chinese. Those who are used to western food may not eat it. Hotel feedback June 2, 2008: Dear guest: Hello! Thank you for patronizing Tangshan Jinjiang VIP Building Hotel. We are deeply honored to have your stay. We have received your message. First of all, thank you for your good evaluation of the front desk service of our store. In addition, regarding your suggestion that ""hardware facilities are too old"", you may have noticed that our store is undergoing renovations, and strives to create a comfortable and beautiful living environment for the majority of guests. This also interrupts your rest. We are very sorry, and have contacted the construction unit, try to avoid the guests' rest time, we kindly ask for your understanding and support. At the same time, after receiving your suggestion that ""the variety of western breakfast is less"", the catering department of our shop has paid special attention to it, and will appropriately change the variety according to the taste of the guests. I believe that it will be improved next time. Regarding your suggestion that ""the bathroom smells like"", because you have left the store, we cannot communicate with you face to face, but we will further strengthen the operation procedures of the room attendant to make the room environment more tidy and cleaner. Thank you again for your pertinent evaluation, and sincerely thank you for your support to Tangshan Jinjiang VIP Hotel, and we look forward to your stay again! I wish you good health, smooth work and all the best! "
0	The hotel room sucks. Service is average. The location is also poor. The room is small and the bathroom is small, so I still squat. . . 
0	The noise is a little bit louder, and the chance of installing XP system is indeed blue screen is relatively high, just install VISTA, other shortcomings are really not noticed for the time being, and the level is limited 
0	What kind of messy things are installed in Lenovo's system, and the 60-day anti-virus trial version is also not installed, it is tiring! In addition, the power adapter is very hot and I am worried. 
1	The additional equipment is there, the heat dissipation is gone, the installation of XP is very smooth, the official website of the driver is available, and it can be used quickly, and the cpu personally feels that it is enough. 
1	When I first got this book, I flipped through it, and it felt normal. When I returned home in the evening and finished eating, my daughter studied. I took out this book and read it. Is it possible to use these diet remedies for my daughter’s symptoms? Try it first. My daughter has been coughing for a month, but nothing is getting better. Use six cloves of garlic, put it in a small bowl, and put it in the pot to steam. My daughter drank it for two consecutive days and really stopped coughing. It seems that I have to study this book carefully, the methods in it are really useful. Friends who are considering buying, please don’t hesitate, this book is worth buying. 
0	Very average, the location is super bad, the facilities are very old, I live on the 2nd, it cost me 500 oceans, distressed 
1	In the past, I often participated in many prize-winning competitions, and I often encountered Sudoku questions. In the previous section, I saw a new Hong Kong film in which the bishop was answering Sudoku questions when he was on the bus. It felt like a realm. I had nothing to do in my spare time, and I had a sudden inspiration to book four Sudoku books, one on the bedside at home, one in the car, and one in the office. The rest of the book is already in charge-mine. Son now. Develop intelligence, exercise logic and reasoning skills! Take a book with you and have fun on the road, at home, after work, and at any leisure time! 
1	This book is a classic. Whether you study history or not, whether you love history or not, whether you understand even a little bit of history, you should read this book. Although the whole chapter is about historical research methods, and it is a high-level and wise explanation of historical research methods, what is more important and valuable is the philosophy of a generation of masters in dealing with affairs and life. It is a generation of great Confucianism and history. And even a deep understanding of Chinese culture. The way of pursuing scholarship, first and foremost, is to treat the mind, which is fully reflected here. What kind of life attitude to live with, look at Qian Mu, it is very enlightening. 
0	The service is poor and the room heating is insufficient. I changed the room twice. have a bad attitude. There are other people's hair on the bed in the new room. I am very upset to ask the waiter to change. 
1	The hardware is good, the service attitude is good, I will choose to live here next time I am nearby 
1	I bought several parenting books before and after giving birth, and this one is the most practical. Because he is very considerate, he can best relieve the tension of the new mother. There are already many things that new mothers have to worry about. This book always says that it’s okay, it’s okay, as long as your child laughs often and is energetic, don’t focus on issues such as height and weight. Although I don't like the Japanese tone, but compared to other books, he is really good. The Japanese are really considerate. When can we make our own classic~ 
1	Whether it is the perfect drill Wu Baiyan or the silly girl Ning Mo, they are all trapped in the past feelings, staying in their lonely but safe emotional world. Both are looking for a safe way of feeling. Although attracted to each other, they are afraid of getting hurt again and losing again. The two have always kept this proper distance, and the ambiguous attitude is very consistent with the mentality of modern men and women. Therefore, I personally think that maintaining an ambiguous attitude is reasonable and ambiguous is a safe way of feelings. Facts have proved that distance and ambiguity will not hinder the development of the relationship between the two people, sincere hearts, and finally gain love. 
0	"I couldn't resist the temptation of so many good reviews from Ctrip. I didn't plan to come again, but decided to experience it again in order to decide whether to choose. Sure enough, I basically didn't disappoint me this time. The 358 yuan exquisite room I stayed last time, the 456 yuan executive suite I stayed this time, alas! You get what you pay for. Hygiene can be better-there are many black spots on the sheets. You can pay more attention to the details-why is there no time on the meal coupon? I have to call again to ask; The bathroom exhaust fan is too noisy, it feels like on an airplane; The decoration uses too much glass, which is a bit dazzling, and the bathroom should use an opaque door. In the review on November 15, 2007, I mentioned ""The King's Landing"", and then I really went to live once, and I felt that it was just three words-""very disappointed"". It was a waste of such a high building and this good name. The decoration is too Amateur, no class, poor service, I went to live on 11.18, there was no heating measures, and I didn’t tell the guests, so I left the air conditioner for the whole night and caught a cold directly. When I checked out at the front desk, I found the waiter also caught a cold. The symptoms are obvious, and I still ""stick to work with illness""-don't want to think about the feelings of the opposite customer? Just in time for the invoice to run out, I stood there waiting for the waiter to replace the new invoice for more than five minutes. There was no apologetic word from beginning to end. Additional comments February 29, 2008: Sorry, 2 points are given to ""Jun Lin Tian Xia"", give Hongyu 4.2 points. "
1	I got it yesterday. I usually buy it with 5.1. It’s 200 yuan cheaper. It’s very affordable. You don’t need to bargain with others. It’s easy to get more colors on JD.com. After waiting for a long time, it’s good. 
1	I like the author’s writing very much, and I can find a way of getting along between them. Whether it’s a couple in a relationship or a married couple, everyone should accommodate each other and study hard. I think this should be a life-long effort. The topic of business:) It is regardless of gender, age, and level of life experience. Every time in life, there are philosophies we want to understand and know! I also hope that everyone can share your own thoughts with each other, thank you~ 
1	I bought a notebook with this configuration at this price. There is nothing to choose from. There are many things to give away, the machine is good, and the configuration is reasonable. In addition, the camera is very clear~ 
0	I just received it and found that the keyboard is a little loose, and the touch screen is too difficult to press.The most important thing is that the system blue screen is caused by turning on and off the optical drive when turning on the computer.I don't know if this is the reason. The others are normal so far. 
0	"Being fooled, there is nothing substantive, but some living habits of the author, the idea is showing off here, and the title of the book is suspect. I prefer the book ""Internal Factors Determine Appearance"" "
0	The processing of individual buttons is a bit rough, and the surface is not smooth enough. There was a blue screen when drawing pictures with 3D software. This problem did not reappear after restarting. It may be a misoperation; it is a 13.3-inch screen that looks like a 14-inch screen and is carried in hand The inside is a bit heavy; the deliveryman is uncomfortable asking for payment before inspecting the goods; 
1	The configuration is quite good and can meet the general household needs, and the heat dissipation can also not cause obvious discomfort. Some drivers need to be downloaded from the official website. The installation of the XP system is very smooth. It has been used for two days and it is still normal. 
1	Wu Ruijun’s paintings are very simple, just like when I was a child, I liked to scribble on paper, draw a chick, draw a tortoise, draw a dragonfly... I’ll be very happy. The author’s paintings are simple but often One picture depicts the different expressions of each character in each situation. After reading it, it will make me smile unconsciously at the corner of my mouth, faintly, but after laughing, it will make me fall into contemplation. Is the man in the comic saying what I think? Have you already done that? Not only me has changed, but you, us, and them have all changed... 
1	Jingdong's distribution speed is getting faster and faster, it is worth topping one. Things are pretty good too, perfect screen, powerful and affordable, it is an excellent choice for our common people. It is really rare to have such a model at this price point. Come on Jingdong. . . Support you,,,,, 
0	The room is ok, the breakfast is not good, and the surrounding is relatively remote. Service attitude is average. 
0	Things are good, can be small, things are good, can be small, things are good, can be small 
1	I bought it for half a month, and I haven’t found any major problems. There are some minor problems. After a day’s use, the computer is still slightly hot and not as loud as other books. 
1	The location is very convenient, the room is very comfortable, and the service is also very good, but the price is not cheap! 
0	The memory is relatively small. If you install windows 7 in the future, you need to install a 1GB memory. . 
1	This notebook is very good value. Don’t have any misunderstandings. The installation is actually very easy. Although there is no windows operating system, it is also a good thing, that is, software costs are not included. Don't give bad comments for this, and ask customers to watch the question. No nonsense, to say something practical, there are several points to note when installing winXP: 
0	The camera is not bright enough, I don't know if it is a computer problem, the color can't be adjusted, tell me if you can adjust it 
0	This should be the most disgusting five-star hotel I have ever seen. The service is not good, the room is not good, and the early is not good. I heard that it was opened without a boss. I'm not too particular about it. Change it! Trouble Ctrip recommends a good hotel! 
0	This is definitely a black-hearted shop, which fully shows the ugly characteristics of Henan people. A bed sheet was dyed a little red by my faded underwear. It turns out that it can be washed off, but they (she) charged me 40 yuan Money. In fact, bed sheets are only worth 10 yuan. I didn't want to issue an invoice at the beginning. I asked them for taxation before giving up. Friends, don't live. 
1	There are no gorgeous sentences, no modified words, and it makes me feel as warm and casual as eating home-cooked meals. The little Doudou from the book appears by my side at any time and talks to me from time to time. No matter which child, when he was born, he had good qualities. How to carry forward these good qualities in children is more important than asking children to write more sets of exercises. Xiaodoudou is undoubtedly lucky, Ba Academy gave her a fertile land, but how many Ba Academy has a principal Xiaolin? Education itself is a very profound thing, it is definitely not just the score on the exam paper 
1	Garden-style hotel, in the city, a bit old, but the rooms by the garden are nice! 
0	I was really disappointed. I was looking forward to this set of books, but when I received it in the morning, I found that it was almost the same as the set of crackling books I bought before, except that there were a few more small copies. I was particularly disappointed. Bought 
0	The printing quality of the book is very good, but I personally find it worthless! It feels that the content is not good, and the packaging feels very luxurious! What is sold is not the content but the packaging! 
0	The biggest reason for buying this book is that I read a lot of reviews and gave a high evaluation of this book. After I bought it, I was disappointed. The first is the printing quality. Many reviews think it is very exquisite. I personally think that it should be rough in the children's books. The second is the content of the books, most of which are outdated, which is quite different from the current society. Finally, let's talk about the plot of the story. After all, it was written by a foreigner. Many plots are far from the national conditions. I wonder if reading it to a child will affect her in the future. 
0	I didn’t receive &#183;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183; I ordered two books and only one book was received. Fortunately, it was paid on arrival. When there are rare errors and errors 
1	I received the goods faster than I thought, and it was good for viewing from the outside on the computer. I was a little surprised that it was too small. The system has not been replaced yet. I felt a little hot after I tried it for less than two minutes. I hope there will be nothing wrong with using it. 
1	Compared to a hotel in this price range, it is still very good. The rooms are small but very clean, and the toilet facilities are also very sincere. The taps are very large and the washing is very comfortable. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but it is a buffet The kitchen is connected to the dining room, and the food prepared by the waiter is taken out. It looks very warm and really feels like home. The soundproofing effect of the room is not good. 
0	It can be said that it is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. The shabby lobby, dirty rooms, and terrible bathrooms are definitely a nightmare! ! 
1	The hotel is located in Sha Tin, with fresh air and large rooms. The LCD TV is placed on a large window sill. The door of the hotel is the Shing Mun River in Sha Tin, and across the river is the largest commercial area in Sha Tin, as well as the Hong Kong Heritage Museum. By the way, every Wednesday, the Hong Kong Museum of Art, Hong Kong Science Museum and Hong Kong Heritage Museum are open for free. Interested travelers can visit them. 
1	"The deluxe room is very new and beautiful. It is as big as a suite and has a special luggage room; the balcony is large, the bathroom has both a bathtub and a shower, and a small dressing room. The service is also top-notch. They are all girls who have seen the world, professional and decent. The restaurant is also very good, ""eat in Dingshan"", even the price is five-star. All in all it is a super nice hotel, designed for staying here, it is also worth coming to Nanjing once! "
0	There is no system, and the attached driver disk is Vista. The system that wants to install XP must download the driver from ASUS official website, which is more troublesome 
1	"After reading this book, I once again felt that I was really talented and inexperienced, and once again saw the demeanor of an expert in the world. Yes, in this era of drunken gold and gold, how can we ensure that our unchanging nature will not be disturbed and confused by external disturbances? We need to think. I have not read the book ""China is Not Happy"" seriously, but after only reading ""Why is China Not Happy"", I already feel that I have nothing to be complacent about for the motherland. After all, we lack There are still many things. "
0	The surface of the piano paint will easily leave fingerprints and scratches. Some people comment that the C drive is too large, but this partitioning method is almost a common method for all factory notebooks! 
0	To be honest, I was disappointed. After reading other people's reviews, I thought it was okay before going. The result was a surprise. I don't think I will go to this hotel anymore in the future. 
1	1. Originally, the system was equipped with DOS, but the received was genuine Vista 2. Originally, the hard disk was 250G, and the received was 320G 
1	The configuration bought at the cashback special price is relatively high cost-effective. The battery can be used for about seven hours (the so-called power-saving to nine-hour setting was not found), and the keyboard is also relatively beautiful, which is greatly improved over the 900 series 
1	The Home Inn mentioned earlier should be Home Inn Shenzhen Railway Station, located in the Yumen Village community. 
1	Good appearance, good speed, comfortable keyboard, low heat, long battery time, fast delivery and high cost performance. 
1	The front desk service is very friendly, and the surrounding traffic is also convenient. It's just that the carpet next to the hotel bathroom is damp and a bit moldy. But the price is cheap and the price/performance ratio is decent. 
0	The breakfast is terrible, but the four stars of this kind of place are almost like this. 
1	Advantages: This is my first notebook, so the concept of good or bad is not clear, and the current game is OK. 
0	I bought the books for the ranking list. I don’t know why so many people commented very well, but for me, it’s tasteless. Why do you say that? First, if it is a book of determination, it cannot be mentioned. Second, if you talk about things that everyone encounters in the workplace, I think it's a marginal shot. Third, a little bit of the so-called love in the book is even weaker. Books are really not to my appetite. After reading it, I just put it aside, feeling that I won't go to read the second book again. 
0	This ghost place is actually a Samsung. It’s hard to believe it. 
1	"I received the book in good condition, but the delivery was not fast, it took a week. ""Where is the person you like, where is the cutest.""——The reason for buying this book, I:) Hush, the main line of this story is the distribution of property. The children get together due to the distribution of the property of their parents, and finally take each Needs, separate things. ——Unexpectedly, this is the main content of the story~ The story ends, alone, continue to move forward, continue to happen new stories——Reminds me of the days when I was reading in a university campus lecture classroom, I was quiet and hungry Flatbread to fill your hunger, drink cold water...

0	Deleting the LIUNX system is a bit troublesome. The screen is too small and the resolution is only 1024*600 and it is uncomfortable to see. 
0	"This hotel will never be used again. I booked a day stay on June 24 through Ctrip a week ago. On the way from the airport to the hotel at noon on the check-in day, I received a Ctrip SMS saying: ""You booked the Best Western Hangzhou Meiyuan Hotel for 6/24 stay. , Due to government requisition, you must check out before 8:30 in the morning on 6/25. Please be aware."" Inquired to Ctrip and said that they had just received such a notice from the hotel that day, and the hotel front desk could not explain why such an arrangement was made. As a hotel guest, staying until 12:00 noon is the most basic right. How to ask guests to leave early with a short message is really absurd, and it has also seriously lost the name of an international group. How do you know that this hotel will treat its guests under the name of the government in the future. Although after some theory with the hotel, the front desk called my room to change and said that I will not leave early, which is even more irritating. On the one hand, guests have to fight for the basic right to stay. It turns out that government expropriation is actually quite flexible and does not necessarily have to be implemented. Ctrip is also very different. How can we accept this arrangement from our partners? If the hotel has activities that cannot be rented out, it should be handled as early as possible. It is impossible to accept the reservation and rent the room while sacrificing the most basic rights of the guest. Send this SMS for the hotel so late , And did not take the initiative to provide guests with contingency arrangements, only to say that it is a hotel matter, has nothing to do with Ctrip, which is unacceptable. Hotel feedback August 12, 2008: Re: Dear guest: Our hotel deeply regrets the mistake that should not have occurred this time; I sincerely apologize for the unpleasant experience brought to you! Sincerely look forward to receiving your understanding and support again! "
0	The heat is amazing and the fan is very noisy. Some software cannot be updated, and some of the trial C drives have nearly 200G, can't they be divided into 2 drives? The most depressing thing is that after delivery, it will become an IPOD 1G delivery today. Although I don’t like SHUFFLE, it’s better to deliver something than not. 
1	This book is the crystallization of the author's half-life wisdom and a major contribution to Chinese ancient culture and modern science. I read this book with a lot of respect. I am deeply grateful to the author for his selfless mind, and unreservedly contributing his talents to future generations. He is far more brilliant than those pseudo-scholars who have some achievements and rely on intellectual property to make money. I would like to pay high tribute to this scholar. On behalf of my descendants, I would like to express our respect to him and thank him for his work for the cultural heritage of the Chinese nation. Gongze will always be respected for future generations. 
0	My son likes it, we just watched I want to have a star, I want to see the sea and I want to have a younger brother, I have to read each book 3 times before I am willing to change it! 
1	Product segmentation strategies are worth learning, and Wang Wenjing’s personal enthusiasm for customers is also worth learning. However, UFIDA’s executive power seems to be average, and the strategic decision-making is very good, but the implementation is not very good. I understand some of the projects that UFIDA does, and the evaluation is not good, even the people of UFIDA. In a market like China, with an industry position like UFIDA, his performance should reach the tens of billions level, and it is still far short. 
0	Whether to send a mouse and whether to have a built-in microphone is not stated in advance, the customer service consultation part of the customer service is also somewhat irresponsible. . . I bought an extra mouse and headset. . . 
0	The system installation is fairly smooth, why the network card driver has not been installed. depressed. fn+f11 is useless. 
0	"I must admit that the slogan of this book is really well written, which touched my heart deeply, so I bought both 1 and 2 at once. It's a pity that, in addition to the exquisite printing, there are a few comic illustrations that are okay. The content is really blunt and funny. It doesn't make me unable to help laughing, nor does it attract me to read it all at once. Naturally, the memory of words can't be said to be vivid, profound, and effective. In this case, I feel a little bit deceived, so I have a poor impression of this set of books, and I feel that the ""name"" is much greater than the actual book. I hope that others will be cautious when buying. "
0	The courier didn't deliver it upstairs. It felt a bit awkward to ask me to go down and pick up the goods. I hope that Jingdong will improve it in express delivery. 
1	Very satisfied, the location is good, the road in front of the door has been repaired. The decoration and facilities are relatively new, and the detailed services are very good. No harassing calls were received. 
1	1. Good packaging and complete accessories 2. High cost performance 3. Good LED display, no dead pixels found 4. The shape looks very light and simple 
0	Ctrip's staff claimed to be built according to the 4-star standard, so they booked with confidence. The result was surprising. The room is very small, the bathroom facilities are in a mess, the hot water faucet and the water are broken, and the staff is called to repair it for a long time. The room facilities are not 4 stars at all, at best 2 stars. The check out rounds are also waiting for a while. The service attitude is only average. Ask the door boy to call a car, but in the end he still has to walk to the street with his bag and wait. I changed Crowne Plaza the next day, a world of difference! Do not recommend this home 
0	The frame is too thick. The frame of the T40 that is put together is a bit too much. The system vista home is too tasteless. It took a lot of time to install 2003. It is recommended that comrades who do not have an optical drive be prepared. 
1	"Compared with cartoons, I think a lot of beautifully written text is the highlight of this book. So my daughter has listened to me reading this set of books from the age of 3/4, and now she has been reading this book by herself at the age of 7 and a half. She has always been interested in this set of books, especially the ""Mole and the Eagle"". How many times have I read it. To make her daughter fall in love with reading, ""The Mole's Story"", ""Tim and Saran"", ""A Different Carmela"", ""Fable Insects"", etc. have all contributed. It is also highly recommended to parents, these sets are indeed good books that can attract children. "
1	The environment of the hotel itself is good, the terrace and pavilion are very quiet, and it feels like living in a garden. There is also a free swimming pool, which made us feel very surprised, but unfortunately we did not bring a swimsuit. The room is average, there is no special feeling, the service is not bad, there is a waiter to help bring the luggage to the room (no tip: -)), the company arranges a business trip, I booked the hotel myself, and finally found that I forgot to get the invoice and call Call the hotel, and the hotel agreed to send it to me. Although it is payable, they are still very grateful. There is no elevator, and the building is very short, it seems to have only 3 to 4 floors. The outside environment is not very good, the surroundings are relatively backward, and the town center is still a 10-minute drive away. 
0	The soundproofing of the room is really poor, and there are people in the next room, so I didn't sleep well all night! The house price is not low, only 50 yuan cheaper than Huayang! 
0	It was delivered at 4799 on the first day, and 4699 on the second day. I felt unbalanced. The driver's support for vista is really good, and it is installed automatically, but XP is a pain for me. I fumbled one by one, but the result was not satisfied. 
1	The hotel is relatively close to the airport, the scale looks good, the service is good, the hotel restaurant is also good, the best is the big bed room, which is great. 
1	I like it. Since I bought it, I have read it with my daughter. My daughter asked me how a mathematician became a writer. I said that anyone who engages in scientific research, even if it is not a writer, needs a certain amount of writing skills before he can tell others his views. This is why you must read and practice frequently. The most valuable thing about Academician Li Yupei is that he uses fairy tales to express the mathematical problems that have caused many people's headaches, and it is so contagious. I think every child who reads his works will like mathematics and can stop worrying about mathematics because it is a wonderful world 
1	Advantages: Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
0	It is recommended that the hotel restaurant prepare locally produced drinks for foreign guests to taste. 
0	The mouse is uncomfortable, and the monitor resolution and refresh rate are too low. It’s a bit numb to install the XP system. It took a whole afternoon. It is recommended that the manufacturer write a detailed installation manual on the disk. 
0	The price is too expensive, more expensive than Acer...The hard disk of the entire machine is divided into a C drive, with a VISTA family version system, it is more troublesome to modify other systems. It is necessary to retain the C drive data, lossless partitions, and multiple operating system startups Problem...Under XP system, the sound quality of computer speakers is significantly reduced... 
1	We arrived in Qingdao at more than one o’clock in the night. The hotel arranged a free airport pick-up. The hotel’s service began from then on. When we got on the locomotive, the driver handed us disinfection towels and mineral water. It was cool, when the car was approaching the hotel, the driver informed the hotel that the guests would arrive immediately. The car entered the hotel and stopped directly in front of the door of the room where we were staying. The waiter had already been waiting here, opened the door for us, and sent us in. The room immediately sent two glasses of juice and told us that it was too late. In order not to affect our rest, we will check in tomorrow. The VIP building we stayed in was newly renovated. We booked the North Room. It was arranged on the first floor. The facilities in the room were good. The beds and beddings were all standard enough to sleep well this night. The next day during the day, when there was a small decoration sound, LG gave some comments. The hotel immediately changed the room and upgraded it to a sea-view room on the 4th floor. The hotel’s open-air seawater swimming pool normally starts at 10 o’clock. LG has the habit of swimming in the morning. The waiter in the swimming pool said that you only need to greet you when you come. LG was very happy. I also made an exception and did not sleep late, so I went for a morning swim. After having dinner at the hotel, LG coughed a few times in the dining room. The waiter in the restaurant immediately delivered a white fungus soup, and then delivered cough lozenges. It is really rare to see such meticulous care. Everywhere in the hotel, every hotel employee I see smiles sincerely to you, making people feel like this is a big family, everyone in the family is very friendly, and our hearts are smiling. From many subtle points, it reflects the management level of the hotel. From the hotel employees we contacted, we saw their love for the hotel. It is really rare to be proud of working in this hotel. Among the hotels we have stayed in, this hotel impressed us deeply with its first-class service, first-class smile, and first-class management, and it is none other than Qingdao in the future. 
1	very beautiful! ! It runs fast! ! Recommended! ! ! The keyboard is not resistant to dirt! ! ! ! 
1	Nice hotel, but the room is a bit smaller, the bed is a bit harder, and everything else is good 
0	When registering at the front desk at the scheduled time, the service staff told us: XC did not make a reservation, and later made multiple calls... In addition, the reservation price and the retail price are only 4 yuan difference... 
1	Although the room is small, it is acceptable. It has complete facilities. The only thing I feel is that the room is full of mirrors, and the wife can be seen from all angles in the shower. It's cool. The only downside is the inconvenient transportation. Every day we take a minibus from the hotel entrance to Kowloon City to change to the subway (the price is 4.7 yuan). The minibus is gone after 11 o'clock. Luggage can be stored for free, but it must be locked. 
0	1. The machine does not have XP driver, it took a long time to find the driver. There is no xp driver on the official website. 2. The touchpad cannot be locked. 
0	The price of a beautiful surface is the fingerprint recorder. I have asked my friend to put a protective film on the outer surface and inner screen of the machine. 
1	I like this book, the one I really like. I read it one day after I bought it and reviewed it again the next day. I still love it now. I bought another version of Wang Gui and Anna on Dangdang. I called that version the script version. Although it is rich in content, it lacks the author’s pen. When writing, the kind of crystal clear, clear, long-lost water that slowly flows into the heart is as refreshing and happy as the cold spring water in summer. Thank you Dangdang, thank you Liuliu, thank you for providing me with good spiritual food. 
1	I haven't finished it yet. I read it roughly, and my heart is very heavy. This is a fact that I cannot accept. As a mother, I was shocked, but I couldn't blame those children, because after all, the responsibilities are many. I am glad I found this book and let me know this fact. I read with my husband, intermittently, and sometimes I can't bear to read it, but we know the direction of our education. This summer, I will give this book to my daughter who is in the second grade of junior high school so that she can read it carefully. We will discuss the problems in the growth process together to make her a healthy and happy talent. 
1	From the moment I read this book for the first time, I found more and more that the details in it have too many similarities between me and you, this. . . . . . . . Is it a coincidence? So no matter if I have watched this book or this movie a thousand times, I still shed tears. Every time I cried more sadly, but I don’t know why I cry. It’s not because of the plot, it’s not! Because the movie is not touching, even. . . . It can even be said to be a bit boring. . . . But I still shed tears unconsciously. . . For you and for yourself. . . 
1	Advantages: The room conditions are simple, the atmosphere is warm, the accommodation environment is relatively quiet, the price is relatively reasonable, and the service attitude is good; Insufficiency: The windows are almost as high as the roof behind, and there is no anti-theft window (net), so the sense of security is not high. 
1	As soon as I received it, I turned it on immediately, replaced it with XP SP3, and used it for nearly ten hours before confirming the receipt. The heat dissipation is good, and the keyboard is easier to use. There is an interface for an external display, and the SD slot is very useful for me. After the Bluetooth driver is installed, I have purchased a Bluetooth device, so it is more practical. The factory and the drive are backed up after booting, so the optical drive is okay to use. Normal CD-ROM drives will have some noise and vibration, which is normal. There are no dead pixels and bright spots. After downloading the driver from the Internet, it is quite easy to use. 
0	1. The USB interface setting is not reasonable, but an external USB socket is fine. 2. The mouse is too sensitive and easy to operate 
1	The speed can also be very humane. If you buy it, you can make a system backup disk. If there is a problem with the system, you can install the genuine Vista at any time. 
1	All the necessary configurations are available. Daily office and home should have no problem. The appearance is fashionable. The blue background light is very foreign and the buttons feel good, but the first and second shortcut keys on the right don’t know what function the camera works well. , But unfortunately can't rotate 
0	It is a pity that the machine wifi does not support wpa2-psk, and finally connect with limited MAC without password. The machine has a large abrasive tool, and it is estimated that a 12-inch screen will work. 10g eee storage feels bad to use, and the internet speed is too slow. The xp driver is not compatible under win7. 
1	Many people have mentioned that the left hand rest is very hot, indeed it is. The sound is not good. You can't hear the external sound effect! 
0	Fooled, each article is very short, it looks very unsatisfactory, it just feels like it is over. But later I learned that Zhang Ailing’s articles are in this style. 
0	"At first the SD card could not be inserted. Later I learned that when it was inserted halfway, the end of the card should be ""lifted"" to insert it to the end. The same is true for the PC socket? The card can only be inserted halfway. The lock lever did not pop out. No, I haven't studied this issue so far. "
0	First of all, I am not satisfied with the express delivery. The goods should have been delivered to me when they arrived, but the courier took leave and said to deliver the next day. I can't wait to pick it up! I opened the notebook and saw that the keyboard cap jumped out. It must be a fall It was caused, but the machine was fine. Why did JD embezzle the laptop bag that Asus should send? 
1	The environment is very good, the service is very good, the traffic is inconvenient, and the price is a bit expensive 
1	The hotel is still very good, I booked a suite, the service is very good, on call, the checkout is very fast. By the way, the third floor of this hotel is a high-end KTV, the service lady inside is very beautiful, and I have a chance to see it. 
1	"Finally, after reading it carefully, Hahabi's ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" is more comprehensive and more interesting! Both practical and readable! "
0	"I couldn’t stand it after I watched half of it. In the second half, I hesitated a few times and let go of the passion that I didn’t continue watching. The story was so plain that there was no ups and downs. I learned that little thing in the workplace too vaguely, without specific description, and Du Lala is just an administration. It is an unskilled job that can be described by an individual. It is really embarrassing to have such a technical content. The author originally bought it for the best-selling ranking first. I think it will not affect most people. Have no taste, right? It turns out that this cruel fact is a ""bestseller"" that makes people chew the wax... "
0	Purchase process: 09.5.27. If you don’t cooperate with the inspection, the box will flash when you open it, the manual is not packaged after opening, the battery is not sealed, and the folds have slight friction. The system occupies a 200G panel for 2 hours. The transformer on the power supply is hot enough for barbecue , There is a sizzling noise. 
0	Yes, I chose it for my friend. My friend is more satisfied, but there are fewer USB ports, and they are all on the left. The picture is wrong. 
0	AMD is really hot, the fan speed is high, the standby fan sound is not too loud, and compared with intel, the heat at full speed is a bit higher 
1	The appearance design is very smooth, using ultra-thin design, the visual effect is very good! The touchpad is a bit of an IPHONE phone, and the color matching is very cool, which is very suitable for girls! 
1	It has been tested for a long time at the self-pickup point. It is a perfect screen, and it has good performance in all aspects. There is nothing wrong with running Vista, so XP is not modified. It looks pretty good. I have done the partitioning online. 
1	The machine is very cost-effective. The workmanship of the machine is very good, the perfect screen of Chi Mei (unfortunately the screen in 2006), the keyboard is very comfortable to use, the camera is very clear, the microphone volume is also good, the speaker sound quality is very good, the 15.4 machine does not feel very heavy, ASUS's after-sales service is pretty good. All in all, the configuration of this brand is good 
0	I bought it after seeing the rave reviews on the Internet, and I felt disappointed when the book arrived. Means nothing. The 2-and-a-half-year-old son didn't like it either. 
1	The front desk service attitude of the Bank of China Building is very good. Helped me solve the reservation problem in time. I am very satisfied. The best hotel in Baoding city is the Bank of China, with a four-star standard. When I arrive in Baoding, I live in the Bank of China Tower, and there is no other choice. 
0	This battery is really a little weird. It’s bulging, which affects the appearance, and the connection is a bit loose, and the balance is good. Find a good angle. 
0	The driver is super troublesome. It is easy to use VISTA. The driver of the wireless network card can be found on mydriver. The model of the network card is NE771, and you can find the F50 model. 
0	"I bought it because I received a ""recommendation"". There is no content at a glance, it's too foolish. It is better to search for related articles on the Internet. "
0	This one can also be called a three-star? Go in the house and don't know what it smells like. The towels in the bathroom are terribly dirty and there is no hot water in the bath. The next day I changed to the hotel next door, which was cheaper and clean. I hope Ctrip will not recommend this hotel anymore, it is disappointing! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	Cost-effective, the mold is very suitable for women, choose wine red. The match is very good! The combination of hardware is also relatively balanced! It is not very complicated to install XP. If you have some understanding of the file system of Linux and Windows, you can install the familiar XP system on this baby soon. 
0	Very general. The price/performance ratio is poor. Compared with the express hotels in Shanghai, the price is expensive and the service is poor; the air outside is good. But the interior decoration needs to be improved; the height of the windows is too low, and they will fall down accidentally; what is incredible is that the double bed room was booked, but the bed was broken; it felt very bad. 
0	The place is remote, and the concierge is not serviced at all. When I went to live a few days ago, the air conditioning was not available. The hotel excused that it had been turned on, but there was no sound of it. In order to save money, it was an exaggeration. I will definitely not stay in this shop next time. 
0	This one can also be called a three-star? Go in the house and don't know what it smells like. The towels in the bathroom are terribly dirty and there is no hot water in the bath. The next day I changed to the hotel next door, which was cheaper and clean. I hope Ctrip will not recommend this hotel anymore, it is disappointing! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	I stayed for the first time last Saturday and I feel good. I often travel to and from Hong Kong and Macau. I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Hong Kong. Yuelai is the most cost-effective one I have ever stayed in. The rooms are big and clean in Hong Kong hotels. The transportation is also very convenient, 20 minutes to Mong Kok, shopping is also very convenient, a lot of food. In fact, shopping in Hong Kong does not necessarily have to be Mong Kok or Causeway Bay. The general shops in Tsuen Wan are also very complete, and the price is cheaper than Mong Kok, unless you want to buy real brand names in Central. Traveling on business only needs a clean and affordable bed, Yuelai is a good choice 
0	Everyone is advised not to stay in this hotel, which is known as a four-star standard, but the items in the room are very resistant, especially the towels, which are not as good as business hotels such as Home Inn and Jinjiang Inn. After living in, it is really fooled, except for the sea view. The scenery in the room is fair, but the others are really unsatisfactory. I checked in at the end of April and the room was very cold. I called to ask the hotel. The answer to me was that there is no warm air now. Let me cover the bed with more quilts. You said it was ridiculous. laugh? 
0	It's huge and heavy, with a fingerprint board on the A side~ Lenovo's video software is pretty bad, and the noise is scary~ The sound is gone~ Barely accept~ 
0	Very disappointed, the content of the book is messy and meaningless. The whole psychiatric hospital looks like a mental clinic. My brain is blank after seeing it, and my mood is not light at all. For friends who want to read and have fun, this book is definitely not the best choice. 
0	It didn't take much time to read this book! It's done in one go, and it doesn't feel much afterwards! It makes no sense! I advise you not to buy it! 
1	The configuration is high, the heat dissipation is very good, the body has no obvious heat after 8 hours of use, the LED backlight tube, and the interface design is reasonable. 
0	The room is small and the style is old. Especially the service is bad. I stayed in early March, when the room air conditioner was blowing cold, and I told the waiter three times that there was no effect. Even though they asked for a quilt, I almost got cold. For three days, I went to Wuhua and went to Wuhua. The price ratio is too bad. Compared with the next Wuhua, the house is more than half the size of the same price, and the style is very domestic, especially I lived in the corner room, and the large-curved floor-to-ceiling glass brought Furong Road and Hexi scenic spots into view. 
0	Because the screen is 16:9, the fonts are very small when playing games or browsing the web, which makes it hard to read! 
0	The heat dissipation is a little bad. And the confirmation of the payment in the store is too troublesome??? Confirmation was confirmed for three days! 
0	Chronicles, unlike novels, can’t be read by literature lovers. Office workers can also take a look at pastimes. Literature and art can’t be talked about, and there is no mood to appreciate it. The publicity is too exaggerated. My reading speed is still relatively fast, but this book only has more than 60 pages after two nights. My favorite book can read 150-200 pages in one night. 
1	At this price, the configuration and the brand are no more worthwhile. Compared with the machine, the appearance is more fashionable and thinner, and the function also meets most needs 
0	Reading a good book can see the soul of the author, but Yu Dan's book does not, it is general, not worth reading, not worth buying. 
1	"I really want to write a review after reading a set, but ""dang as a sincere invitation"", haha, in fact, think about this book is indeed worth writing, when I first read it, I felt that this book is ""under the prestige, it is actually difficult"". It's duller than I thought, but I just want to watch it. It is not the same as the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty Zhu Yuanzhang in our memory. Everyone knows how he treated his former comrades in arms after the founding of the country. But after reading this book, he felt that this man was quite up to the standards of an emperor. Haha, look at the problem by the emperor’s standards "
1	At this price, you can buy THINK brand notebooks. They are very good. They are made by large factories, good heat dissipation and good screen effects. 
1	When I first saw the title of the book, I secretly guessed the content of the book and opened it to see, my God, the entire encyclopedia. Due to the nature of my previous work, I am very sensitive to this knowledge. When I read it carefully after a meal, I feel that there is something special. The wide range of content and the amount of study show the painstaking effort of the editor. But Jin is not full, the breadth of knowledge in this book is enough, but the depth is not enough. If you want to broaden your horizons and broaden your knowledge, you can be regarded as good friends, but if you want to learn more, you need to use professional works. All in all, it's still a good book, and it's worth reading. 
1	I started to read the comments of several friends in 2005, but I didn't dare to move in. Unexpectedly, it has changed a lot now. The room is small but tidy. I will choose this hotel again next time. I just hope that broadband will always be free! 
0	I bought it after reading a lot of good reviews on the Internet. I feel cheated. Is this a good book? The picture is gloomy. I even want to sleep when I read it, let alone show it to my children. In fact, the original purpose of the book is very good, but after copying it from abroad, the picture is really ugly, it is really not interesting at all. Want to retire! ! ! 
0	I have paid for the third day and have not received the goods so far! I entered this interface because of a wrong point. Helpless! ! ! 
0	The environment of this hotel is too bad, the service is average, the bathroom feels like a flood, the hotel has not been rated, and the more annoying is the cabaret on the first floor. It is so noisy at night that you can’t sleep. How uncomfortable it is to sleep well, and the hotel will arrange the worst room for you through the room booked by Ctrip. I hope that Ctrip will review member hotels more strictly in the future. 
1	Good heat control! High cost performance; the received 9400-512mb graphics card is better than the 9300-256 written on the configuration! Speed 10 can be driven, the details are a bit stuck. 
1	The white piano finish is good, the battery life is satisfactory, the weight of the notebook is appropriate, the Dolby sound is good, and the keyboard is relatively large. 
1	The basic facilities are OK and the service is warm. Breakfast is average, but has Jiangxi characteristics. The problem I feel is the sound insulation of the walls and doors, which is not very good. 
0	Except for the advantage of being on the lakeside. There is no advantage that can be mentioned. The room is old, the bedding is broken and dirty, I really take it!!! 
0	The delivery was very fast, that is, only a plastic bag was used for the outer packaging. When the courier brought it, the box itself was a little damaged. . . 
1	"Speaking of it, the part of Potter's death and resurrection is very similar to the saints. When he was defeated, he thought of the goddess or some good memories, and then said ""Burn it, the small universe"", it is very brave Jumped up and defeated the boss-level boss. ^-^ "
0	When Ctrip ordered the Veyron, it was originally focused on two points, one is the four-star level and the other is Hong Kong company management. After staying, I found out that the name was not true. First of all, the level of service has absolutely no shadow of Hong Kong's service, even the upper-middle level in the country. A huge cockroach was wiped out in the bathroom on the first night. I think there should be no cockroach guests in the four-star hotel. Although there is a swimming pool, the public opening hours are from 1 pm to 7 pm every day, but during this time, guests always come to the front desk to ask for the swimming pool. The front desk temporarily finds someone to open it, and the pool water is very cold, so most people have the courage to jump in There are not many, and the swimming pool is therefore useless. The roof of the swimming pool has become moldy or peeling, which is unpleasant to see. It is worth mentioning that the doormen in the lobby, because the hotel is in a side street and there are no taxis, they go to the main road several times to help guests take taxis. 
0	Dangdang is well advertised on the Internet, but the content has no practical significance, and there is no new knowledge and ideas learned from the book. The quality of the book is not good, you can just look at it after you buy it. 
0	Explain. I am about Dangdang. Not this book! After I purchased the book. After the payment, Dangdang is out of stock. The transaction is closed. But it has been almost a month since it should be mine The money has not been returned yet. It adds up to almost 10 orders. More than 300 yuan!!!. I am going to vote for 315. 
1	Get a perfect screen, more clear and delicate, LED backlight + 16:9 watching HD movies, good heat dissipation, good or bad, the keyboard looks very good, it can be used, this configuration can play general 3D, if the game is not high This is enough, and the price is okay 
0	The pre-installed Vista of the system is uncomfortable to use, and it would be better if you can send 1G memory. Ha ha 
0	It is purely a self-defense book, fooled! The content is simple, and the author is always eloquently defending himself. It is purely a book of hype and packaging! 
0	Many people think highly of this book. I can only say that this book is not suitable for me to read. I probably browsed it and felt that the contents of the book are already known, and there is no interest in reading it without mentioning things. ~ 
1	Although I like Zhang Xiaoxian's words very much, and I have read the Bread Tree series a long time ago, I still bought all her favorite books and collected them. The story of the Bread Tree series hates the heroine’s personality and does not like the ending. For a so-called perfect love, I gave up so many excellent men who may be suitable for me. It is not worth it, but such a dedication to love may impress many people, I do. I also shed tears for the sad plot in the book, sighing and sighing, but this is not what I want. The love that everyone pursues is different, but some feelings can be the same. 
0	But the price cut was too fast. When I ordered 4299, it took less than a week, and it dropped by more than 100. This is too unfair to consumers. Although the price reduction of electronic products is impermanent, JD.com should take the lead in regulating the electronic product market. 
1	1. Beautiful appearance design 2. Configuration suitable for most needs 3. Independent graphics card with mirror LCD display effect is first-rate 
1	I stayed in the luxurious sea-view big bed room No. 7-10. Before booking through Ctrip, I called the Blue Sky Hotel and told me that there was no room. I was still depressed. But with the idea of ​​giving it a try, I submitted an order on Ctrip, but I didn't expect to send me a text message to confirm it! At that time, I was very surprised, because I was taking the baby with me, so I was afraid of making mistakes. After arriving in Weihai, I called the main station to confirm and told me that the reservation was OK. This was relieved. It is indeed the most highly rated hotel by Ctrip netizens. The service is better, and the baby cot is prepared for us in advance, and the overall waiter is very polite and warm. The sea view has been damaged by the Qiming Holiday Hotel in front, but it is still good. You can see the sea from the bed. The breakfast is also good, very rich, with Chinese, Western, South Korean, and Japanese. I personally like western breakfast. Both cherry and chocolate cream pudding and egg tarts are good. The egg tarts are still iced. When LP drank the porridge, he whispered to me and forgot to take another spoon. The waiter brought it when he heard it. Take the initiative to prepare a baby chair for my baby. I want to eat breakfast as lunch, haha. If you go to Weihai for vacation in the future, you will still live here! A little suggestion: Evening paper can be delivered a day, that thing is nothing but a piece of cake. I have stayed in a hotel in Guangzhou and delivered the Yangcheng Evening News every day. You can also send two fruits a day. Generally, guests who come back for a day are happy to eat a peach or a small persimmon, and the cost is only one or two yuan, ha ha. Additional comment July 11, 2008: Forgot to mention, the drain valve of the bathtub seemed to be loose on the first day I lived there, and the water leaked relatively quickly, which caused most of the water in the tank to leak a lot, so I could only take a bath while draining it. Taking a bath, it makes noise and wastes water. When I went out the next morning, I told the waiter. I came back in the evening and found that it should have been handled. The service is more attentive. But later, there were still some small omissions, ha ha. Hotel feedback July 11, 2008: Dear guest, hello, thank you for your message! We will try our best to meet your needs. We welcome your valuable suggestions and hope to provide you with better services when you next stay. 
0	"Delivery is extremely slow. I placed an order on 3.1 and shipped it on the 4th. Now it has been 40 days and I haven’t received the book. I won’t sell books here next time. It took a long time before I received the book of ""Just So A Few Ways to Stock Stocks"" I bought last time. "
0	The piano paint is easy to leave fingerprints and the mold style is rigid. The original driver cannot release all the performance of the GF9650GT. Download the driver from the NVIDIA official website to play the game and will not get stuck. However, when the password is switched on and the fingerprint interface is switched on after the power is turned on, the screen will appear and then change to the original driver. 
1	Another heroine who has been favored by God! Another heroine who makes excellent heroes wait eagerly! The waiting time is seven years! Long time... what an equally good heroine that should be! ? Haha, it's a pity that the heroine is just a reckless, cute love, no scheming, silly, so-so... Oh, there is a huge difference between the hero and the hero! Humph, this can only be fate! it's fate! Divide and reconcile, and finally got what you wanted. Maybe this kind of girl must have this kind of man to care for and rely on! It's a pity that this happens only in books or idol dramas! 
0	The keyboard gets dirty too easily. I wanted to buy a gray one, but when I think about the graphics card, I chose white. I just ordered the keyboard membrane on JD.com, but it is out of stock in Shanghai and is being transferred. I don't know when I will receive it. But after all, it's really white and beautiful 
1	"1) There are fewer screws on the back, saying that there are fewer thinkpads. 2) The shell around the keyboard is not flat. When I press it down, I find the sound of ""Zila Zila"". I realized that it is a double-sided tape. It won’t come up, and it will rebound after a while. Obviously, double-sided tape alone won’t stick. You might as well take a 502. At least it will make me feel comfortable if it sticks so tightly (but this just makes up for the quality problem) ), why bother to make a screaming sound, how annoying? (There is also a place where double-sided tape is used. When I changed the memory, I found that the left side of the lower cover of the keyboard could not be opened, and I did not dare to use force. "
1	It only took me three nights to read the book roughly. After reading it, I lent the book to my sister-in-law. Because of the many methods and concepts in the book, I thought it was right, so I lent the book to my sister-in-law. , I hope to help her. Generally speaking, the content of the book is good, it will not be stale, you can even read it as a novel, and it is very interesting. Of course, some of the views in the book are quite good, so that you can learn more about breastfeeding in the future, so that you don't know how to deal with problems when you have problems. 
1	It is small and practical, and looks good; and the area where the system disk is located has been separated from other areas, although there are only two areas, it is enough 
1	"I bought 5 copies of the book ""Water Knows the Answer"" at one go, because this book is so good, because 70% of the human body is water. If you speak the language of love to water, water can produce beautiful crystals. , If people say good things to each other, I think we humans can control our emotions well, and people can be successful in everything if they have a good mood. ""Harmony"" can be seen everywhere in the society. People live in a ""harmonious"" environment. Don't everyone lead a happy life? Those who want to live a happy life on their own should watch ""Little Know the Answer""! "
0	1) The screen looks uncomfortable, that is, the fonts mentioned by the buddies in the front row are blurry. After taking the after-sales service, the result is that this is a bright screen, which is what it is... It is recommended that buddies who have the conditions go to the physical store to experience the experience; 2) The uppercase letter key is a bit loose. When will I go to the after-sales service to see if I can change it. 
1	"[Recommendation] I think many people have heard of Lin Yutang, and he is a very famous writer, but why can't I find Lin Yutang in the history of modern and contemporary Chinese literature? I think ""My Country and My People"" is one of the reasons. This book is a bit unaccustomed to read when it is compiled, half-literate and half-white. I thought it would be the full text or the vernacular. This book is a great work that analyzes ourselves. Hope that there will be a complete version of ""My Country and My People"" in the future. It is useless to confine your thoughts. We must believe that the eyes of the people are sharp! "
1	"ITIL has high reference value as the best practice of information system service management. However, just like the problems faced by many foreign standards, norms and models in the promotion of our country in the past, different cultures, social systems, management concepts, and traditional customs will lead to differences in thinking between the East and the West. Therefore, we must fully understand the experience of others. 、On the basis of practice, it is possible to ""learn from"" well. This is the role of this book and the value of purchase-the basic conditions for understanding. However, ""bringing it"" also requires effort! "
1	Generally speaking, the hygiene is good! But you can't boil water by yourself, and the price without breakfast seems to be high. The location is good. It is recommended that guests go to a breakfast shop opposite the hotel! 
0	It's not easy for men to use, it's a bit thicker, the screen resolution is a bit worse than other brands, the mouse buttons on the fuselage don't feel good, the 1024X600 display rate is still a bit smaller, and playing games is very uncomfortable! 
0	It’s really depressing. Dangdang’s speed is really slow and crashes. It’s been half a month since it was shipped from December 10 to December 26. 
1	Network marketing has actually played an indispensable role in our real economy and society. It was not until I read this book that I realized that this is a long-tail model, and suddenly realized that the various industry activities in our lives are like Kaleidoscope, you can find a wonderful thing from any angle and any direction, and you will feel the shock that you have never had before! The operation of the long-tail theory model has not only opened up a new world in online marketing, but has also greatly changed the concept of releasing social personality and enhancing understanding. Long tail is really magical, all magical! 
1	David experienced such a childhood, it is really incredible. How could there be such a cruel mother? One of the most direct feelings after reading this book is that although David's experience inspires many people, it feels cowardly. I think it’s not to struggle with life stupidly, but to try to change the bad situation and change life, and David has always been waiting and expecting. Once the expectation has passed the deadline, it is not expectation. All you have to do is change! But this book is really good. After reading it, I cried and thought for a long time. Thank you David for writing his experience to everyone. 
1	For the price of a little more than 100, the room facilities are basically okay, a bit old, the bathroom is not very good, the bathing place is not isolated, and the toilet is completely wet after the shower. Air conditioning and TV are available, and there is a radiator in winter. Very enthusiastic, provide pick-up service, the bellman will take the initiative to deliver your luggage to your room. Additional comment November 9, 2007: Another point, the hot water is a bit small, the bath is not very comfortable 
0	The silver buttons feel abrupt, and the overall feel is not very strong, at least not as strong as the HP 6XXX series. 
0	This model has no fingerprint recognition and no face recognition. The information on JD will be changed! Also, the camera needs to be well-lit and far away, otherwise the color is super light! It's super slow to run VISTA. It's great to change XP! 
1	It's still average, and it's good in domestic computer brands, but it's still far away from HP. Internet access and USB flash drives are relatively hot in the left hand area. 
0	The price is not low, the grade is not high, the environment is bad, the lobby is small, the room is average, the breakfast is unpalatable, and the feeling is average! 
0	The design of the screen is a bit small, with a wide margin, which is a bit wasteful; the blue screen of the machine just appeared, what's the matter? The new discount will come as soon as the purchase is over. Be careful with Jingdong in the future. Not to mention reminder. 
0	"It's a pity to stay here for one night during the Spring Festival. 1. There is no heating and air conditioning. The main station told us that Xiamen only has heating air conditioning with 4 stars or more. In fact, there are many budget hotels. This is misleading. 2. The attitude is not good. Maybe the business is too good. I asked for a quilt and said that there is no more. There is only one. We have two rooms. The complaint was resolved after Ctrip. What did you do earlier? 3. The bed sheet was not very clean. There was a footprint on it and asked to change it. When I changed it, I found that there were a lot of people's hair under the bed sheet and asked to clean it. The waiter's answer was ""It doesn't matter if the bed sheet is covered anyway."" Halo 4. The room is big enough, but it has been renovated for many years. "
1	I have been to Fujian more recently, and I always stayed at the Manhattan Jianlian Hotel, because the first time I lived was a good one. I stayed in a business room. Although the room is not big, the items are complete, and the dolls on the bed make people have Feel at home and good service, 
0	The deposit and checkout can not be swiped by credit card, but cash is required; the two beds in the double room are against the wall, the room is small, the facilities are very old, it is simply a guest house, I will not live here in the future. 
1	Lightweight, but the 12's heat dissipation is still a problem. After a long time, the heat around the keyboard is hot. The overall feeling is good, but the hard disk has only one C drive without partition. 1G running VISTA part-time is nonsense. I suggest other friends to add it above 2G. There are a lot of pre-installed software, and the boot is a bit slow, but it is acceptable. It is recommended to optimize the startup items. 
1	The location of the hotel, the rooms are very good, the price is more appropriate, I recommend everyone to live 
0	1 The VISTA system is really slow, and a lot of things are not used to it. 2 The hard disk keeps making noises when it is running, but the sound is not loud. 3 It is really thick for a 14-inch notebook, compared with my original 15-inch compaq Same thickness 4 Warning sound is very loud 5 Hard disk has only one partition 
0	We stayed at this hotel on May 2nd. First of all, the appearance was a bit old. The name of the hotel entrance was Jinshan Hotel, not Xinjinshan, which made us a little confused. The hotel lobby is large, but the facilities are relatively old. We booked an executive room. When we walked into the bathroom, we first noticed that the floor had a lot of hair, and it was dark, as if it had not been cleaned at all. The carpet in the room seems to have not been cleaned for a long time, and there are so many stains. The air conditioner in the room is not cooling. I told the waiter, but no one came to deal with it. I couldn't sleep well at night. However, the hotel bed can still be praised, it is moderately soft and hard. Next time I go to Hangzhou, I will not consider living here. 
1	The executive big bed room I live in really likes the environment in the western suburbs, the black swans in the yard, the red-crowned cranes, and the small wild cats in the western suburbs, a comfortable place to rest in the bustling Shanghai, and I will live here in Shanghai in the future. 
0	We stayed in the standard room of the hotel during May 1st this year. The sanitation was average and the room smelled a bit peculiar. There is a supermarket opposite the hotel. If you want to buy stuff, you have to hurry up early. It seems to close at 8pm. Lots of roadside snacks at night. 
1	The book is basically read again. This is the second time. Although the content is relatively complicated, it is easier to read, the language is gentle, attractive, and the content is vivid. It is basically a summary of the experience of health preservation and treatment, and supported by basic theories. It is easier to learn and generally feels good. 1. It's just that it may be more difficult to do it, and I need to change my personal life habits; 2. Chinese medicine is too esoteric, and I basically don't understand the meridian part, so I need to spend some time studying; 3. At the same time, I am already in teacher Ma's personal I was diagnosed on the website and I was very satisfied. 
1	Because the Yuehua Hotel has no rooms, I passed Ctrip Dingquanzhou Hotel. In fact, the whole of Quanjiu is more elegant than Yuehua, and the decoration is also very particular. The only thing that is less than Yuehua is the service and breakfast. 
0	The worst hotel, there is no sense of service at all. I booked a hotel for a friend and said that it was possible to pick up the plane at the airport, but I did not receive a call from my friend and did not even call me. My friend came back from a foreign country. I couldn't contact her. She just stayed at Jinjiang Inn next to the airport. I called the hotel more than 11 o'clock in the evening, and the other side said irresponsibly that the person had not received it. Maybe the plane was late and promised to say my friend When I arrived, I called me, it was completely nonsense!! I suggest that everyone don't stay in this hotel, it is too bad!!! In the end, no one received it, but I was so embarrassed to call me and ask for money later, it was really bad!! 
1	Concise and applicable. The required configuration is there. I was worried about dead pixels. The quality is reassuring after receipt. 
1	Big brand, trustworthy, very powerful and full of functions, moderate in feel and weight, after using it for a few days, it feels good 
0	It is said that the best hotel in the area is subjective, and everyone has different requirements. Three points are very unacceptable! 1. The locomotive repair station (locomotive depot) is directly opposite, which is whining all night... 2. Three sexual harassment calls in one night! There was actually three points, and they were called from different people! 3. Hotel sauna center! It's just that...Don't talk about it! Go to Neijiang in the future! I would rather go back to Zigong by car! 
1	I got the refund of the last computer and bought this. It's good. The return is easy. This one has good configuration and good heat dissipation. No hardware shortcomings have been found. 
0	The picture is messy, I am used to a more delicate style of painting, and the content of the story is also very boring. 
0	I have not received the order after 4 days. I don’t know if Dangdang’s delivery is all this efficiency? After the complaint was over, the customer service replied that it was a normal phenomenon, and the order processing time had the final say! 
1	Unit users must not buy, it is too inconvenient to pay. The check must be delivered to the account, but the check was given. It was not there for two days, and it took a day to find the check there. The order placed on the 18th was delivered on the 28th, and it was still paid in cash, and the check still did not arrive. I don't know which unit can tolerate such service. 
1	"I think this sentence really makes sense. Say what I feel! ""Taxis are just like that. You can't get them when you have problems, and when you see empty cars running around, you will bother you when you see one. "
0	The heat dissipation is general. I thought that the temperature was high when the system was installed. Later, I found that the bottom is also very hot in actual use. It is best to match the heat sink. The workmanship is more detailed, but the details are not perfect, and the lid is slightly tilted. 
0	The sanitary facilities are poor, the towels are dark and hard, the sewer is blocked, the mattress is not good, and it is not very comfortable to sleep on. I think the service attitude is okay. Opposite is the long-distance bus station, there are many taxis, it is very convenient to travel. 
1	The hotel recommended by a friend, the location is good, the traffic is very convenient, and the hotel’s service is also very considerate. When checking in, a glass of ice lemon tea is delivered at the front desk, which makes people feel the hotel’s attentive service. On summer nights, sit in the outdoor beer garden and drink Drinking beer and chatting with friends is very pleasant. 
1	The hotel rooms are spacious and clean, with soft lighting. Overall, they are good. The attitude of the front desk staff is also very good. But broadband still needs to be charged, whether this should be improved. 
0	Give up, don't be fooled by the title of the book, this book is not suitable for Chinese parents at all, and there is no actual content at all. The most worth remembering is the title of this book, read it out loud for your children! 
0	It is more troublesome to install the system yourself, and it takes longer to get it done. The movie felt streaks when I first played it, but I changed the display to the standard and it was OK. The touchpad is hotter. Maybe because it is AMD CPU, it consumes more power. For commercial use, intel and 14-inch screens or less are recommended. 
1	Originally bought as a gift. My child found out, and liked it so much, he just tried to read it for a few nights, and was reluctant to give it away. First of all, the quality of the book is very good. Second, it can be seen that the editor is very careful to organize, it is really a children's reader, the text is concise and easy to understand. Third, after each story, there are notes explaining the nation to which the story belongs, as well as the narrator, collector, etc., which enriches the background knowledge of the story. Fourth, the illustrations are exquisite and distinctive, allowing children to use their imagination. Incidentally, it is suitable for children above the second grade, because there is no pinyin. 
1	Toshiba has entered China many years ago. This notebook is very good in terms of weight, workmanship, screen and tone. 
0	The hotel is very quiet, it is very suitable to live here in the tourist area, a few minutes walk is the entrance of Qinyan Tower of the scenic spot. It's a long way to work in the city. There are a few problems with the hotel. First, due to the small number of guests staying in the same day, the boiler room did not boil less water at all. The front desk and the waiter kept asking us to boil the water for a while and it would be hot. The result was cold water after 10 minutes. The next day there were so few people who came to live with a little bit of warm water. Second, because of the small number of people living in the hotel, there is no buffet for breakfast. The waiter will give you a dish and a few steamed bread. The environment of the hotel is more comfortable, and the rice is very delicious, pay attention. 
1	"The first time I watched ""Ordinary World"" was in the third year of junior high. After watching it, I was very impressed. Later I watched it several times one after another. It always got me deep in it. I bought pirated copies before and there were always many mistakes. , And there are still few plots. I can finally buy a good copy of a genuine book, and I will introduce it to my children in the future. Our generation still has feelings about life in the countryside, but children today don’t know these things. , I think only these good books about rural works can help children understand the peasants and the countryside. It is indeed a good book worth buying and reading. "
0	To be honest, I waited until the book with full expectation and found that at most one-third of the content in it was about treatment methods, and the rest was just the author’s subjective metaphors and metaphors, plus a bit of reverie, which was very cumbersome, and obviously I was making up the number . sorrow. . . 
1	In Zhongshan Mausoleum, it is very quiet, there is no sound at night when sleeping, breakfast is ok, service is ok 
1	The location is very good. I lived in a superior business room. I feel that the room is a bit small. The cooling effect of the air conditioner is not good. But the doorman and waiter are very enthusiastic. And there are free fruits. The carpet and decoration are a bit old~~~ 
1	A good book, but it has not been well promoted. Although it is not as popular as the wisdom of not getting sick, it is closer to our lives and gives us careful guidance. 
0	"The writing is very good, but there are a lot of page numbers in the middle, which can be upside down when you read it-trouble! I want to change it, but I'm afraid that even this one is gone. I hope Dangdang's ""dang"" is not a fooled ""dang"". "
1	What impressed me the most was the feeling when I opened the curtains--it was a golf course outside--it was very cozy! The room was also good, but the parking was not convenient--it was too far, and it happened to rain again. 
0	"I am a person with a strong subjective color, speaking very arbitrary, I cannot proceed from the overall situation, and cannot look at issues from the perspective of literature and current affairs. Just an outsider's idea. Because of the enthusiasm caused by lust, I once again turned out Zhang Ailing's book and felt that it was not enough, so I would like to buy it again in this life and this world. After reading it, the most eye-catching among them is naturally the women of the Republic of China. In fact, in addition to this article, there are quite a few worth reading, such as writing about mother, about childhood, and hometown. However, I can't read anything that involves other women he wrote. The point is that he is not passionate, but feels innocent. He didn’t understand why he couldn’t talk to Aileen about Xiao Zhou, why Aileen was jealous, why Mr. Fan was jealous, hehe, he loved a lot of people, but whenever he left, there was a new woman beside him. You can fall in love immediately. I don't intend to refute it, because it is easy to be called ""feminism"". I always think this term is weird. People just have to respect each other, and no rights matter. However, I have put this book on top. Literary talent has literary talent, but he is not the only man in this world who has literary talent. I only pay attention to it because Aileen can't forget it. "
1	The overall price/performance ratio is relatively strong. You can buy such a notebook at the price of 2999, and it feels very worthwhile to install the system. 
0	1. The body is small, the heat dissipation is poor, and the right palm rest is hotter. 2. The price is still expensive. If it can be cheaper than 1000, I will buy another one. 3. Why do we have to bind to GSM! It is strongly demanded to remove the restrictions. Isn’t it all about the Internet fee? Who is tied? 
1	Others are ok, although it is not enough for the 5-star standard, it is still very clean and spacious. The most unbearable seafood buffet dinner in the resort area is surrounded by flies. Seeing that the food is covered with flies, it cost a lot of money. It fell into a fire.... The aisle beach is beautiful and quiet, 
0	Both hardware and software are very disappointing hotel. After reading the comments of my friends, I didn't want to stay at this Ramada in Tunhe, but due to the difficulty of booking a room during the tourist season, I had to come. Stay one night and leave, I suggest friends not to try it casually. The lobby of the shop is narrow. The room size is not small, but the furniture is few and old, and it feels cold and empty. The carpet is dirty and the decoration is old. The bathroom is small, the bathroom and sanitary ware are dirty in color, and the towels are sloppy. There are very few TV programs. The sense of service is extremely poor, and the assistant manager at the front desk and lobby is arrogant and arrogant, and arguable. The operator is like a novice, answering the wrong questions. Only the doorman took the initiative to take the luggage for the customers, showing dedication. The breakfast feels like in a guest house. There has always been a lack of internal training in the hotel, and the upper and lower staff have absolutely no idea of respecting the guests. I don't know who is responsible for Ramada's brand management in China. It's not four stars at all, I heard that it's a bit worse than Samsung's Xinrong Building. It is also hoped that Ctrip can strengthen research and provide customers with more accurate information. 
1	Liu Lin is strong, just like the doctor in the article said, in the hospital, it is the best way to show whether a person is really strong. Liu Lin is a kind of strong person, and being strong has become her protective color. However, her strength is distressing, and people want to get close to her but they don't get close. I admire Liu Lin's strength in the article, because to be a strong woman like her, you really need to disguise tears and loneliness. Although girls nowadays are also very brave. But there are few who want to be independent and strong. This is a good book, a good book that makes people think deeply after reading it. 
1	"The girls in Ming Xiaoxi's book will have many friends, especially close friends in the boudoir. Feelings are like Baicao and Xiaoying in ""The Whirlwind Girl"". There will be no negative emotions such as jealousy at all. They support and encourage each other to grow together, warm and touching. "
0	Halfway through, some pages were blank, and a good book was cut off in the middle like this. I want to return the item, but I have already made notes on the book. 
1	The location of the hotel is good, the park is just outside, but the room is small, breakfast is ok. 
0	"Meals are general, and the price is slightly more expensive than usual. Please pay attention when signing and paying the bill, because it has no details, only write ""a la carte"" and a total amount ""such as ""a la carte — 1032.00""). If it is a group transfer, please pay thousands Please pay attention to the phenomenon of overcharge, and the cycle is very long, it may take a month to reconcile the account. (Please distinguish that the sales are reconciling with you, not the finance). "
0	The content is so-so; the printing production is very bad, I don't know what garbage paper and ink is used, it is very smelly, it smells bad, and you can't get close at all... 
0	I stayed at this hotel for the third time. My previous experience was okay, so I always chose this hotel, but this time I was unable to swipe the card. I felt that the hotel was deliberately trying to save the handling fee. Fortunately, there was a cash balance, otherwise it would be really troublesome. Don't want to live next time. 
0	The executive room I booked, the room is very small, and the building is relatively old, except for the Internet access, I don’t think it is different from the general standard. The hotel itself is also very small. 
0	The optical drive sounds amazing to a few discs, but most of the discs are very light, probably because of the problems with those discs. 
0	When I saw the book, I felt that the content was messy at first. At first there were several pages of touted words, and then dozens of pages of nonsense. Then I will talk about this and that, and I have to rewrite the words in each paragraph according to a title. On the one hand, waste paper (if you want to emphasize that you can use bold printing), artificially increase the space, increase the number of pages, and increase the price. The content is not practical and feels fooled. 
1	Very satisfied overall. It is a bit far from the city center, and the rooms are clean and tidy. The big bed room I live in is slightly smaller. The service was very good. I washed my underwear for free and delivered fruit every day (2 bananas plus 2 apples). The waiter was very polite. The disadvantage is that the breakfast is not abundant, and the restaurant on the first floor is too expensive. 
1	I brought my friends back to Qingdao to play in April. The hotel was chosen for them. The room was clean and tidy, but the bathroom facilities were too simple. There was a small refrigerator in the room. The consideration was more thoughtful. It would be better if the bathroom facilities were better ! The attitude of the service staff was very good, and did not shame us Qingdao people, and the phone was on call. 
0	The location of the hotel is good and the traffic is convenient. However, the appearance and room facilities of the hotel are relatively outdated. 
1	Through this book, I have seen the personal growth of Yu Minhong, and also understand that everyone has their own different experiences, and they will encounter different situations at different times and stages. The key to whether they can cross the past is their own mentality. This positive attitude is very helpful for a person's whole life! This book also specifically talks about the employment problems of college students. Many of the problems in it are encountered by many college students now. Not only are they helpful to college students, but they are also very enlightening for our young people. It is a very good film. book! ! 
1	The writing is really simple, I suggest you read it carefully, there will definitely be different receipts! 
0	The soundproofing of the room is really poor, and there are people in the next room, so I didn't sleep well all night! The house price is not low, only 50 yuan cheaper than Huayang! 
0	I ordered the goods three weeks ago, and the delivery company delivered the goods on Saturday. I was not in the company. They said they would deliver them again in three days. They turned out to be returned to me, which delayed my time and asked me to evaluate. P, I'm so angry! I won’t buy books in Dangdang anymore~~~ 
1	It's pretty, and it looks very attractive. The function is also very complete, and it is very comfortable to use. The price is 200 cheaper than those of Gome, because there is no mouse and original bag. 
1	LD and I stayed for 7 days and 6 nights, and 2 chocolates were delivered every day. The hotel’s breakfast was very good. The waiter is very friendly, as long as you go out, the room will be cleaned when you come back. No matter how many times you go out, this is good and very responsible! The bed is big and the pillows are also very big, very comfortable! Overall it feels good! There is no dissatisfaction! 
1	The cost performance is very high. Friends who don't play games often can try it. I bought a Lenovo one for my colleague in the month. The configuration is basically the same, and it cost 4500. 
0	The partition is unreasonable and must be re-partitioned. There is no drive disk. The logistics service is not in place. The doorman signed on behalf of the staff, but there was no inspection. 
0	I bought the Vista home premium version written in this notebook, but I got the basic version. 
0	The attitude of the hotel staff is super bad. Especially the front desk. The restaurant sits without receiving guests. The most annoying is that he hung up the phone before he finished speaking. I advise everyone not to go, otherwise you will be pissed off, traffic will be inconvenient, and the surrounding environment will be complicated. 
0	I bought this book, the binding is okay, there is no color insert, the text of the book is slightly hollow, in short, among so many similar books, this price is not worth buying. 
0	I have stayed three times before, and the room, breakfast, and service are all very good, so I checked in again this time. I didn't expect that this time the room (ninth floor) was very bad, it should be old decoration, not as good as the Samsung Ziwei Hotel opposite, and The room I lived in before is very different. When comrades make a reservation, please pay attention to the level of buffet breakfast on the floor. The standard of service is not as good as before 
0	The pre-installed VISTA system HOME version is very tasteless, it is better to install the flagship version or XP professional version directly. It was a headache to drive when I changed XP. If you want to change to XP, prepare the driver in advance. 
0	"The service support for the user's installation of the system and the driver is not good. The random information and the official website do not have any related installation instructions. Users must explore, find and download by themselves. There are ""secret doors"" during the installation process, such as BIOS settings, HDMI installation, etc. Easy As a result, people who don't understand can't install the full drive. "
0	It’s a lap bigger than my friend’s ideapad S10, but considering that the keyboard is larger and the battery time is long, it’s acceptable, but the built-in Linux is too difficult to use, and it’s inconvenient to enter the bios. It costs a lot to reinstall XP after all the options effort. 
0	The service is average, the room is a bit too bad, the stuff in it is too old, mother's, it is so expensive, four stars can not be reached at all, the next day, I finally couldn't help it, and changed to a hotel. 
1	The price/performance ratio is currently the highest, the quality is also very good, and the keyboard is easy to press. The goods that are picked up now, the system is installed directly after booting, it is really brand new. The game worth 200 dollars is also very fun. 
1	The hotel is nice, the service staff are very nice and polite. It is clean, quiet and convenient. The disadvantage is that check-out is crazy slow, it took me half an hour... 
0	A very simple story, but it contains the protagonist’s bumpy life. To live is pain, and I have to admire the toughness of life 
0	It’s more important than expected, it’s not suitable for girls to carry, asus official website does not have this XP driver, you have to find it yourself 
1	I bought this book after listening to my classmates, and after reading it, I really benefited a lot. There are a lot of shocking words in the article, challenging traditional ideas, but unique achievements. The old gentleman interprets many issues in a different way, digging cultural connotation from the perspective of human nature, thinking about the age he is in, and really admiring him. After reading this book, I have a basic understanding of Chinese cultural history. For those who are not willing to spend a lot of effort to explore the entire book but are interested in cultural history, it is worth collecting. Because the book is not purely vernacular, but also contains ancient texts, it needs to be tasted slowly and carefully. My classmates and I have made an appointment to study this book for a lifetime. 
1	The location of the hotel is not far from the city center and the transportation is very convenient. The lobby is decorated with some European style. Although the space is not as big as some hotels, it is very warm. In the evening, there are professional performers performing in the lobby. When checking in, a team happened to have just arrived at the hotel. The guests sang along with the performance, feeling very atmosphere, like the feeling of this hotel. The rooms are also very spacious and the service staff are very friendly and courteous. It is a well-managed hotel. 
0	The name of Dangdang does not match the truth, and the order will not be delivered for many days. Asking the customer service will only defer, and will only ask the user to place another order. Such service can't keep customers. It is better to go to other websites to buy books. 
1	I have finished reading two books for my son. The book is a good book, but one of the very bad aspects of bilingualism is that when the child is interested in the story, he will definitely choose to read Chinese when he goes to read it. The meaning of English reading ability. 
0	This method of memorizing words is only suitable for certain people. Not everyone is suitable, including me. So please don’t rush in, and prevent being fooled like me, haha! 
1	The location is very convenient for trains, subways, airport buses and cars. Very close to Henderson Mall, you can go shopping and play time. The service is ok. 
0	Inefficient and service hotel, if you hate him/her, let him/her stay in Ningxia International Hotel 
1	"The author is considered to be the ""miracle angel of love"", which is indeed the case. Many people think that getting along with children must be full of happiness, but they do not know that a responsibility makes this happiness sometimes not necessarily in the form of a smile. The author truly reflects the truth in getting along with the child. Although he is reading her ""story"", he feels that his heart is with her. In the same way, I am very fortunate that I am engaged in a job of living with children. This job allows me to have a wonderful life. "
1	"The content of this picture book is very good, it is more suitable for parent-child reading. After I borrowed it from the children's library, my son liked it very much and was reluctant to pay it back. Simply buy it from Dangdang.com and read it again. Every time I read this book, I feel that the emotions of mother and child are sublimated, and I am infected by the deep family affection in the book. You can read this book in another way. My child and I are at home. Whenever we read the bunny's way of love in the book, we use exaggerated body language to reflect it, which is more profound, memorable and more like it. I think this book will always become a classic picture book in our family. In addition, the original ""Escape Bunny"" is perfect. "
0	I ordered a book, which was very good, but when I read it, I found that one page was missing. Then I applied for a replacement, but Dangdang didn't care about me. So I suggest you not to buy things in Dangdang. I'm finished, thank you. 
1	The cost performance is relatively high, the configuration is relatively balanced, watching movies and playing ordinary games are relatively smooth. Very affordable. At this price point: dual-core processor, 3470 independent display, 250G hard drive. It's already very good. I added two Kingston 2G-800s, no compatibility issues. 
0	It's a bit serious, I know, it's not her fault. . . You can't have both fish and bear paws, but people are more greedy 
1	"At the beginning, it gave people a positive and upward feeling. Later, as more and more complicated things happened, I felt very sad...There was a feeling of fighting like that, paying like that, but in the end it was zero. Maybe life That's it. I talked a lot about the ""hidden rules"" of the workplace, but after all, it is a novel, and it is an idol drama-style novel. A heroine always meets two excellent male protagonists at the same time or before or after... However, there are still many things that can be learned, and it’s worth seeing "
0	The expectation before check-in is still very high, but I feel disappointed after arrival. There is still a certain gap between the value of this budget hotel with a price of less than 200 yuan, such as Qidouxing and Homeinn, and the evaluation of colleagues who went with it is not high. I regret not asking for any service, but I don’t know how to check out the speed 
1	The room is newly decorated, using light colors, it feels very warm, the layout is reasonable, and it is more spacious. The linen used in the hotel is very particular, and it feels thick and soft in the hand. The service is good, especially when I am on business. There are more clothes to bring, and the waiter can consider the actual needs of the guests, and add hangers at any time. The hotel’s meals are unique and have been to different floors, and they are all satisfied. Although the hotel is superior in details, but If you improve it in some places, it can be comparable to the local four- or five-star hotels. For example, the bathroom can be hung with a small hook. 
0	Far away from Mount Tai, the actual environment does not match the price, beautiful appearance, old and broken interior, extremely poor sound insulation 
0	"Reading the introduction of this book was originally good, so I bought a set for my child. I hoped that my child could become more imaginative and brave after reading it, but I told the child ""I Can Beat the Monster"" After that, the child changed from being brave to being timid. He didn't dare to be in the house at night. He had to be accompanied by his father or mother to be in the house. I took the book from the bedroom to another room and lied to him to throw it away. After that, I became less timid. "
0	A part of the label on the box was cut off, a label at the bottom of the notebook was removed, and no explanation was given 
1	I bought this by accident. I didn’t expect my daughter to like it so much. I hung it on the wall from the living room to the hallway. After she saw it, she laughed all the time, then slapped her hands, very excited, especially the little rabbit, the little girl, These photos of Xiaoshu are simply incredible. Putting her on the floor of the study room, she would laugh all the time when she looked up and saw the painting, and then she would look up after a while. It was really amazing, so I recommended it to a few friends of the neighbor, and they also said My child likes it very much, there is always one that will make your child laugh, as long as you keep trying to flip these pictures. 
0	1: USB, network port, power port are all on the left, not used to it. 2: The power adapter is too noisy and hot 3: The mouse is not sent 
0	The hotel is far from the center of Jiangmen, and a taxi costs 25 yuan! The service at the Rhein Western restaurant in the hotel is very poor: the water has a peculiar smell, and two of the three dishes ordered claim no ingredients (shrimp scallop platter: the waitress says the scallops are not fresh and dare not serve it;'tomato fried beef': The waitress said that this beef is not available, but the raw fried beef rice and the steak do), and the customer must change to other more expensive dishes. What this beef is not that beef is obviously a lie! And the attitude of the waitress is absolutely not flattering, the action is faster than us when canceling, and we have to look at our faces! Guest room: One of the quilts has holes in the front, and there are holes when turned over, and stains! The kettle is broken, and the water cannot be boiled off normally. At first, there was no hot water in the bathroom, but workers finally supplied it after a period of refurbishment, but the water turned out to be rusty yellow. It took us a long time to take a bath! It's another chilling thing! There are mosquito harassment during sleep at night! Why is there such a phenomenon in the four-star hotel opened in 2005? ? Originally, we were going to take a rest, but we didn't expect to get angry! 
1	The design is square and square, and the keyboard is easy to use. It is a business notebook. The heat dissipation is good. It is used for 5 hours without the fan. Good price/performance ratio, 512 video memory, I have no problem with flash design. 
1	This book is mainly about digital integrated circuits. I borrowed it from the library before and thought it was pretty good, so I bought one. One of the great advantages of this book is that it is easier to read. Even people with a background in physics like me can understand most of the content in the book. As long as you have studied the physics of semiconductor devices and understand the basics of Boolean algebra, you can understand the contents of the book. However, it should be pointed out that the mathematical description of the I-V characteristics of MOSFETs in this book is different from the formulas learned in general classrooms. 
0	The cooling sound is slightly louder. It is too troublesome to install XP. After installing it for two days, I read countless posts on the Internet and made a lot of efforts, but finally failed. 
0	It may be that I am too moldy. The original system of the new notebook has a problem and cannot be started. Fortunately, the customer service is very good. The original recovery disk was sent to me by express delivery on the same day. It has been used normally. I hope that this problem will not occur again in the future. 
1	The front desk of the hotel is very attentive, fast and efficient, and the service attitude is good, with a five-star standard! I want to praise here! 
1	"I finished reading the whole book in about a week. When I first read it, I thought of abandoning it, but since I bought it, I gritted my teeth and read it. Overall it's not bad, for the heroine's boldness and childhood toughness. The content of the article is interspersed with flashbacks, but it always makes me feel that the love of men and women is a bit reluctant. Not as good-looking as recommended. However, the article describes reality well. Early marriages’ complaints about society and the envy of friends around them are very true. It's a successful article, but I feel ""full"" after reading it once, and I don't want to read it a second time. "
0	When installing the memory, I have to admire the IBM employees, how hard did you use them to screw the two screws 
0	I drove there on October. Under the enthusiasm of the hotel operator, it was easier to find it. However, after entering the room, everything changed: the room is only on the first floor, there is no TV remote control, the air conditioner is not available all day, the phone can’t be picked up, I don’t know if I ask the waitress, the travel consultation is empty, and I live. Three days and two nights are the same. However, the food in the hotel restaurant seems to be better cooked than the local restaurant outside, but the price...no comment! Never go again next time! 
0	In the aggerssive book, the body and back of the aggresive book have this kind of error. Please give the reader a reasonable explanation and correct this error! This is also a business reputation issue! 
1	After reading it in one day in one day, it feels the same as I have read the bandit book before. It is touching and romantic, and it makes people want to pick it up. I also imagined that I could meet such a male protagonist, lamenting the heroine’s tragic fate, but jumping out Soberly thought, this novel is really far away from reality. The protagonist's life is luxurious and full of corruption. Cinderella is so irrationally loved by the prince. In reality, people who are slightly mature and sensible will not be like this. Still life, and this book is just a modern fairy tale. 
0	The layout of the room is a failure in Feng Shui, the toilet is clogged, and it is a helpless night!!! 
1	Have been staying many times, the view from the window of Room 04 is still so beautiful, and the supermarket opposite is very convenient for shopping. 
1	The facilities are very good; the surrounding environment is good, close to the golden sand beach; recommended sea view room Insufficient: relatively partial; not easy to eat; the hotel's own restaurant is too cost-effective. The price is too expensive and the taste is not good; 
0	The content is simple and easy to understand, the color is soft, and teaches the politeness and behavior of the baby in daily life. For example, learn to line up and be humble when playing... 
0	The breakfast is terrible, but the four stars of this kind of place are almost like this. 
0	The environment is dirty and unclean. The bed sheets seem to have not been changed for a long time and are worn out. Hotel Feedback June 29, 2008: Thank you for your valuable comments. Our facilities and equipment have been completely replaced. Welcome to your next stay! 
1	I am always troubled by a muddy life, always at a loss because there is not enough time. Although time management is a cliché, it is really effective to stick to it. Whenever I go home from get off work, I will feel a sense of satisfaction. It is a kind of fulfillment and excitement from the heart. I read this book after I bought it home, and I reviewed the past and learned the new during the execution. If you really don’t know how to arrange your time, it’s good to buy a copy. At least from the heart, you will have the desire to work and study. Because time will not stop for anything. 
0	It is much more expensive than others under the same configuration, and big brands need advertising fees! The optical drive is a bit sunken, and it is a bit troublesome to install additional memory, but the flaws are not hidden! 
0	Although the horizontal stripes design has a sense of overallity, it seems a little jumpy, especially after opening, the keyboard area is also covered with horizontal stripes, which looks messy 
1	Lightweight, elegant, restrained, and other configurations other than memory are not bad, but fortunately, I sent a 1G memory stick. The heat dissipation is good, the noise is very low, and the operation is almost inaudible. The stability of the machine is also good. 
0	Advantages: A good notebook is a small screen. Insufficient: A good notebook is a small screen. 
1	"It’s a good hotel. If it’s a problem, the hotel attendant knocked on the door when I didn’t open ""Do Not Disturb"" twice. Before I reached the door, they opened the door without authorization. Haha, I will stay in the future. , Especially those who are doing sensitive things should pay attention! ! Additional comments July 2, 2008: When I booked a room online, I added that the requirement was ""15F or 16F, it is better to be able to see the room in Liujiang"". The room arrangement met my requirements. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable comments on our service. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. We must strengthen staff training to avoid similar service errors. The luxurious viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! "
0	Dangdang’s customer service was rubbish and had a very bad attitude. I used a gift card to pay for an order, then canceled the order, regenerated an order and wanted to pay with a gift card, and found that the gift balance was already zero. Then I called the customer, and it took me 3 to 5 working days to reply the amount of the gift card. I said why it took so long. She said that 3 to 5 days passed quickly, and she didn't know if she was living on Mars. Then I asked, what should I do if the goods of my current order are out of stock after waiting 3 to 5 days? The answer is: you can buy another time! Is this what people say? Obviously my own system is so rubbish, but the customer is required to bear the loss. 
0	Too partial place, too deserted place, too bad breakfast. depressed! ! Additional comments April 18, 2008: Ctrip is recommended not to recommend the past 
0	The service here is not up to the five-star standard, and the breakfast is particularly bad 
0	It is very superficial, and the discussion is especially like a model essay for elementary school students. It is still a very exemplary argumentative essay, with a total score and a few examples in the middle. Feeling fooled, don't like it. 
1	The machine is small, the noise is very small, the heat dissipation is also good, it is easy to carry, the cpu performance is good, the memory is not good 
0	The content is a bit hollow, the writing is babbled, somewhat deluded, and quite different from the practicality he advertised. 
1	"I’m a person who doesn’t like to read books, but since I bought ""Temperature determines birth, old age, sickness and death"" I have read it several times, and I like it very much because my body’s immunity is very poor, I often catch colds, and there are many other symptoms. I feel that many of the phenomena mentioned exist in me, and I have never known how to deal with it, and I am very worried. I have started to soak my feet with mugwort leaves. I hope it will have an effect. I am also taking food supplements, but I am afraid to try the raw loach. I will have other methods in the book. If my body improves, I will recommend this book to my friends. "
0	Quite a lot! The first is heat dissipation. The right side of the touchpad is hot and it is hard to survive the summer! The notebook is not flat on the table, and something needs to be padded in the lower right corner, which indicates that the abrasive craftsmanship is poor! Even if the system is not installed, then the CD has only the vista driver. It is troublesome to find the driver, and novices will have a headache. 
1	A moderately priced hotel in the most prosperous area, with larger rooms and a lot of harassing calls. 
0	The smell is really bad, unacceptable! ! ! The picture is too messy, my son over 2 years old will definitely not like it, I don't even bother to watch it. Regardless of the chick's personality, you must first be interested in watching it! Failure to buy! ! 
1	In addition to the small hard disk, it can catch up with the copybooks. The screen frame is too big and there is a visual misunderstanding. However, the installation of the system is very smooth and the price is affordable! ! ! 
1	I thought it was true at first because I was brain-disabled because of my broken love. Long-distance love will poison a person's love. I know. I know to give up. Know some last resort. There is no scenery, no literary talent, no traces of writings, no masterpieces. Some are just mood. Pure record. This kind of record is inevitably empty, and fiction is weak. But for those who fail in a long-distance relationship, a glass of warm water can irrigate the power of seemingly dead love. There is really no art in this novel. For those who are looking for exquisite reading, watching the online version is enough. 
1	The environment is not bad, and the service is okay. The environment is similar to the Shangri-La next door, but it is much cheaper. I wanted to swim, but I was told that the swimming pool was not open due to renovation, which made me depressed. The ladies at the front desk are stingy with their smiles. Once arrived by Mazda, there was no service at the door; once arrived by imported Audi, someone helped with luggage and got off the car. No one helped send luggage to the room. I guess we are Chinese, so there is no tip. Do you want me to learn a few sentences of Japanese? But I don't want to learn. When I was eating in the western restaurant on the second floor and drinking tea in the lobby bar on the first floor, I saw a lot of girls with different dresses and different accents. I hope I guessed wrong... If I guessed right, eat with them in the same place Not very comfortable. 
1	Room facilities are not 
0	This hotel is ok. But the last two times I stayed there for more than two nights, the hotel told Ctrip every time that I had only stayed for 1 night and then left the shop. It was outrageous and affected my points. The hotel makes this point of caution, it shouldn't be! ! ! 
0	The heat is large, without the system, the CD-ROM has only the Vista system driver, and the XP driver must be downloaded by yourself! 
1	Our family of three stayed at Oceanwide Celebrity Hotel from July 19 to 22, 2008. We have also read online reviews before. With the mentality of giving it a try and a more professional vision of being engaged in aviation services, I truly appreciate the value for money and the well-deserved reputation. Whether it is a bright lobby, floor halls, or clean guest rooms, they are all decorated in a particularly elegant and comfortable style, full of the warmth of home. We stayed in a sea-view room on the fourth floor. It really faces the sea and the spring flowers are blooming. The windowsill is decorated with beautiful flowers and plants, and the sea is endless. The trestle bridge is close at hand, open the windows, and the gentle sea breeze is blowing in the face; close the windows, there is no trace of urban noise. Let us truly feel that we have come to Qingdao and truly enjoy the comfort of a sea view room. Especially the lobby managers of Oceanwide celebrities, tall girls with big eyes, are a bit like the youth version of Ni Ping, but more beautiful than the young Ni Ping. The attitude is particularly kind, and the service to the guests is particularly attentive. He can truly think what the guests think and be anxious. Particularly actively pay attention to the needs of the guests, understand and solve the difficulties for the guests in time. She is always smiling, polite and professional in her gestures and words. Even if it's only drizzling outside, she can be especially thoughtful and take the initiative to send umbrellas to guests. I think she can be an ambassador for Qingdao. She is beautiful and dignified, especially with the style and charm of traditional Chinese women. When I go to Qingdao again, I will live with a celebrity Oceanwide. I also hope that more friends will know this excellent, beautiful and generous lobby manager with oriental femininity. Thank you Fan Hai celebrities for giving us a wonderful holiday, and thank you for the excellent service of the lobby manager and floor attendant. Guests from Beijing 2008/08/01 
0	A lot of what Yu Dan said is misleading the public. Just look at the many comments on the Internet. I personally think it is not worth watching!! 
0	There is nothing to say about the content of the book, mainly the paper, the printing is too poor, the paper used is very rough and worse than ordinary pirated books, and the cut is not good. The quality of this book sold in physical bookstores is much better than that of Dangdang 
1	The love of a woman can be used in enthusiasm, silence, silent staying together and endless quarrels in her life. Every woman's expression of love is released in her own unique way. Their struggles and blind obedience are all for the love in their hearts. The love for children is selfless, and the love for lovers is silent. Every silent movement and expression is the deposition of love in my heart. In a special age, two women struggled, but in the end, it was all for love. The author's delicacy comes from language and thoughts, but Yan Geling's best at expressing stories is layer upon layer and twists and turns. 
1	"After reading this book, I hope you new nobles, petty bourgeoisie, middle class, and returnees, don’t hold the so-called red wine cigar famous Provence grass to show your status and quality in society. If you live in the way of ""Longwuzhi"", your quality of life is really boring. Therefore, ""Longwuzhi"" is very oriental and very Chinese. This book is for Chinese and depicts a picture of real life and spiritual world blending together. From this we know that our old ancestors can play more than those guys now. "
0	The decoration of the room is outdated and the drain pipe is blocked. After more than 2 hours of tossing at night, it was still not repaired. 
1	It is a small book shared by my daughter and I. The content is a condensed version of the original, but it is complete and interesting. My daughter is still young. If she just reads the text, she still doesn't understand the meaning, and it is easy to make a difference. Therefore, the advantage of this book is that there are a large number of illustrations, which can be used to tell the baby. The effect is good. It only costs more than 1 yuan to enjoy the wonderful stories and parent-child moments. Is it good value for money? My daughter and I are both loyal fans of Thumbelina, and I bought all the other books in this set, and I had a lot of fun to read carefully. 
0	To be honest, I did not expect that this time Ctrip disappointed me too much. I have always believed in you. It may be that your company is now bigger, and the customers who have been silently supporting you are beginning to neglect, but to The service nature is the leading enterprise. What you have gradually discarded is not just a group of customers, but your corporate culture and corporate spirit. If you continue to do so, you can only gain market economic advantages by serving a company like yours; in such a fierce market economy, such Survival will be a fatal injury, take it seriously. The last day I stayed at the Jingdezhen Kaimenzi Hotel that you recommended was the worst four-star hotel in the country where I lived. Not only his hardware facilities and services could not be complimented, I was speechless, before leaving I left a message for their hotel, how can such a price and such a service be listed with 4 stars? How does the local tourism bureau review their level? You Ctrip is too irresponsible, how can you put such a hotel casually I recommend it to guests. The carpet in the room has water, and the surrounding carpets in the entire room are all white powder. The bathroom facilities are not as good as the facilities of a 200-year-old hotel in Wuyuan. You can see a lot inadvertently. With the peeling wallpaper, you need to change into their sauna suits when you go swimming. In fact, you can go directly in on the first floor. After asking, I found out that the sauna was contracted out, dizzy! ! ! The guest room asked them to send a few disposable slippers and said that they would charge extra, my God, this is the first time I heard of such a charge in a four-star hotel. After negotiation, I didn’t accept it. If you don’t say anything, you just believe it. Go try it once! ! ! The only comfort is that the service in the hotel lobby is 3 stars. Ctrip, Ctrip, you must pay attention to it! 
1	Nice hotel, good address, in the city center, hotel staff is very nice. 
0	I don’t know why everyone commented that this book is good, but I can only say it in general. At least from the perspective of a novel, the author’s literary quality is really embarrassing to compliment... 
0	The built-in 1G memory with Vista system is still very difficult. Shortcut keys are a bit less. Altec Lansing speakers always feel worse than HP's Altec Lansing speakers. 
1	A very nice five-star hotel with large rooms and new facilities. It is importantly located in the financial center. It is very convenient to go anywhere. I will consider staying again in the future. 
1	When I bought this set of books, I was worried about whether my baby's reading is a bit pediatric. After I got home, I found that the story was very simple, the baby was easy to accept, and I could learn a lot of knowledge from it. Now through this set of books, Yao Yao knows: 1 What animal night Activities, as well as the sleeping postures of various animals. 2 What elephants usually like to do, what do the little ants do before it rains 3 What makes crickets make noise 4 The gecko’s tail will grow when it is broken, and what else What parts of the body will animals lose to protect themselves? How do clouds form and why they disappear. Overall, this book is really good 
1	The surrounding area is not very prosperous. It is basically outside the city center. The traffic is very convenient and easy to find. I booked an executive big bed room, the room is average, but not big enough, the price is not low, the breakfast variety is small, the swimming pool is not small, but I did not bring swimming trunks, so I didn't try it. The service level is okay, the overall feeling is up to standard, the price is reasonable, and I will consider staying in the future. 
0	The keyboard is a bit unaccustomed, especially the cursor keys are too small. The heat dissipation part is not as good as Thinkpad, but it makes sense. 
1	1. It is very light and has a small power supply. It is usually carried in a big bag and carried around. This time the load is reduced. It is cool. The 12.1 inch Dell used originally, which is much heavier than Xiaohei. 2. Low noise, basically no sound when running. 3. Good heat dissipation, and the temperature is not high for continuous long-term use 
1	The soundproofing design of the room is really bad, the wall and the glass exterior wall are obviously not blocked, and the others are fine. 
0	The driver support is perfect. The only thing is that AMD’s heat dissipation is relatively large. I hope there will be no problems in one or two years. 
0	It’s terrible. A friend who has been there once took me there because the Royal SPA there is more attractive. As a result, the room booked in the South Building this time is known to be worse than the room in the main building, but I didn’t expect it to be that way. It is four-star. . . Not as good as the guest house downstairs in my house. Very small room, very small bed, 1 meter wide, super hard, the bedding is super uncomfortable, the TV has a set-top box but no more than 20 sets, 21 inches, very unclear, can not be seen. The room is extremely soundproof, and I always hear other people’s rooms opening and closing doors. The most exaggerated thing is that I wanted to go to bed until I wake up naturally, but I got up at 7 in the morning, just because my parents got up early and walked by the door of my room. He said in a low voice, don't call her, she must have not woken up. . . I woke up unexpectedly, as if someone was talking in the ear. . . It was SPA that I liked better at first, but when I went back to Guangzhou in the afternoon, I started to have a rash. The friend I went with did not get well, and the whole body was long, with small blisters in the center. I don’t know if it is allergies or infectious dermatitis. Anyway, it’s not a good thing. In the end, there is only one point left. There is a swimming pool downstairs, which is more convenient. In order to be objective, I still have to write it down. Don't go. Going is like being fooled. I was in a good mood for a vacation, but it turned out to be angry and sick. Additional comments August 16, 2008: Wow, I noticed that someone in front is 99, then I have lost a lot. I went to the SPA package at South Building 298. 
0	I bought it when it looked cheap. It’s not good enough, but it’s no benefit after reading it. It’s fine to find an online reading, there is no need to waste ten 
1	"The classic books are also very delicate. I feel very excited when I get them. The writing is fluent, easy to understand, and more in-depth in life. It connects psychology theory and knowledge with people's daily life and work, making it also a general public understanding of psychology. Excellent reading with myself! As the author said, ""Psychology is a science closely related to human happiness."" It is close to life and the unique style of in-depth practice is also a good reading for the general public to understand psychology, better understand human nature and improve their overall quality. .

0	The driver CD is not included. When installing the system, you have to download the driver from HP's official website, which is more troublesome. 
1	Due to the new renovation in 2007, some new problems may not be solved in time. I often live there because of work needs, so I carefully put forward the following opinions and suggestions: 1. After the new renovation, the position of the shower head in the shower room of the single room is too High, I changed the room is still the same, very difficult to use 2. Some management and services after the new opening are still not in place, especially the front desk check-in and checkout era is too inefficient (each checkout takes more than 10 minutes, it seems Does not meet the requirements of a four-star hotel) 
0	"To ridicule history in modern commercial language, and put it down after reading the first page. In terms of historical content, it is similar to Luo Guanzhong's ""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" or Er Yuehe's ""Yongzheng Emperor"". Even to the extreme. A further level of ridicule gives people a sense of disrespect for history and makes people have great doubts about the authenticity of its content. If it is an ordinary novel, it is humorous. Humor is okay. It is unacceptable to be so laid out on historical issues. It always makes people feel that the atmosphere of reading nowadays is becoming more and more impetuous. It is true that fewer and fewer people are willing to calm down and concentrate on reading. Publishing organizations and authors have adapted to this trend in other elements, but in the content elements of the book itself, it is more and more neglected. "
1	The service is very good, the environment is good, very comfortable, and the restaurant is very comfortable and warm. 
1	I am very envious of the heroine. Although she grew up in an orphanage, as she herself said, it is precisely because she has grown up in an orphanage that she can experience all the fun that she can enjoy after going to university, unlike those families. A girl with a good condition feels that everything happens for granted. New clothes, balls, travel, nothing can make them as excited as her. The most important thing is that her favorite person is watching her silently and lovingly. She, and finally came together with her, what else is more enviable for girls? 
0	What a bad hotel, there was only one waiter when I checked in at the front desk. The waiter called my colleague by his name, and the colleague even said that he felt that his beautiful classmates from the university were calling him. The so-called business room we lived in was on the 7th floor with an elevator. You can only go to the 6th floor. When you get to the room, you can see that this 7th floor should have been converted into guest rooms, or even an illegal building. The toilets are very small and are the kind of integrated products used on the plane you bought. The room couldn't be connected to the Internet. I couldn't jump up after pressing the button on the phone. I called the waiter in my colleague's room. After a long time, two stunned northeastern girls came up with an enthusiastic attitude, but they were completely rookies. 
0	The room is so poor that it is unimaginable, the carpet is dirty, and there are two large groups of spider webs hanging on the ceiling. Suspicious things that have not been cleaned for many years. Maybe it was rated four stars ten years ago. Now he is rated as two stars. Cancel all the star ratings of the hotel, deceptive thing 
0	The service staff’s service attitude is very bad, they don’t charge room fees according to hotel regulations, and they charge arbitrary fees. 
1	"""Shanyue doesn't know what's in his heart, water and wind fall in front of her eyes."" In Song Dynasty, beauty and sorrow coexist. That period of ups and downs of history remained in this person's unique feelings, polished by time. Those old things are history, the history of words, and even the history of the heart. It touches your heart lightly and takes you into a real journey. Zhang Xilin is a sensitive person. I don’t know why. He interpreted each song poem so perfectly. The soft text and the clear and beautiful words and sentences interpret Song poems into stories. Through the dusty history and the hazy moonlight, he will tell you Whispered. "
0	I originally thought that there would be some words to complement the illustrations, but the result was a full-page picture. I felt that the content was too simple and had no connotation. Just like a baby pictorial, the content was not rich enough, the price was not cheap, and it was not cost-effective. 
1	1. The location and environment are good 2. Breakfast is ok 3. The service is good, especially the indoor swimming pool facilities are more comfortable 4. The room is relatively old, especially the slippers are too thin, not like a four-star hotel 
1	Good location, rich breakfast and fast internet access. It’s just that it’s no longer managed by Marriott, I hope the service level will not drop 
1	The environment is good, the transportation is very convenient, shopping and eating are also convenient, the company always stays in this hotel when traveling in Tianjin! 
0	It's not as good as it was advertised, and there is no practicality, and no entertainment value. Now no one is smashing the wall. I really don't know, what do you do with this book??? 
0	The heat dissipation is not good, the system slows down when it heats up, hey, I bought a heat dissipation base to no effect, depressed 
0	I like this book very much and I can learn some lessons from it. Lala is a lucky person. In addition to her own efforts, the reason for her success is that she has particularly good opportunities and some kind guides. The reality is like this. Even if you put in your efforts, you may not get a good return. But if you work hard, you will succeed when the opportunity comes. Don't complain about unfairness, life is unequal. Simple life, Simple heart. Recommend friends who just entered the workplace to read this book, there will be a lot of gains. 
0	Whether it is a novel or a workplace textbook, the writing is wonderful; whether it is a foreign company, a state-owned enterprise, or a civil servant, it is worth learning and referencing; men can also read it, and there will be gains 
0	Objectively speaking, this is a terrible hotel of the same grade that I have stayed in. Both the overall environment and the room facilities are as bad as a critic said. I don't want to say more, I won't go here in the future! Supplementary comment May 31, 2008: I forgot one thing just now, it is not vomiting, it is the lady who serves at the front desk of this hotel. When I went to check in, it seemed that I owed her much Little, that ignorant look almost forced me to find their boss! 
1	Infected by the author's attitude towards life! However, the methods introduced in it are still within their capabilities and apply according to their physique, because not everyone is as good as a little beauty. I looked at the tomato and cucumber juice she said, which has a whitening effect, but after drinking it, my stomach hurts for an afternoon and I also suffer from endocrine disorders. The reason is that these two things are too cold, and I seem to have a cold body again. , So the consequences of drinking it can be imagined. So, don’t listen to anything, check it out before using it, but don’t follow in my footsteps. 
0	There is no worse room than this one, near the train station. Service is average 
1	Perfect screen. The graphics card is 65nm, it is estimated that it is a 9300GS vest, nVidia's old trick, it is estimated that if you continue to play like this, NV will go bankrupt. Gateway is not responsible for this, after all, the price of 3999 is there. The video memory is ddr2. The heat dissipation is indeed possible, and the online reviews are not entirely gun literature. Upgraded to 4GB of RAM, it is still okay to use. Play WoW settings and debug several times, you can drive to a good level and keep it smooth (full screen 1366x768). 
1	I booked an executive room, but the hotel gave me a free upgrade to an apartment room. It is their new house. The room facilities and decoration are very good, and you can check out until 3 o'clock. Good location, convenient transportation, nearby restaurants It is also convenient, if I go to Nanjing next time I will stay here, I like it very much 
0	It's been a while since I bought it, and my three-year-old child doesn't like to watch it. On the one hand, the cartoons inside are not very concise and clear. On the other hand, many things do not appear in our Chinese habits, so there is no way to explain them to children. There is also the name and language used in the book, which children are not used to. I don’t know why this set of books is still the number one bestseller. The parents of children around me bought them for fame and left them at home. 
0	I promised to buy a computer package for the first time, but it has been almost a month since the disaster has been eliminated, and I have not sent it yet, and I am ready to return it. It is dishonest. In the future, you must buy everything to pay 
0	I haven't read the Japanese version, but after reading it, it feels suitable. The content is very light and has no deep meaning. The drawing is not very good either. 
1	There are too few varieties of breakfast, the traffic is fairly convenient, and the service attitude is not very good. I asked the hotel to buy the map from the old room. 
1	The configuration is OK, and the performance is stable. The game is fine, it runs quietly, but the heat dissipation is not good. I don't know if the quality is good or not, because it didn't take long, Lu Yao knows the horsepower, ha ha! ! ! ! 
0	There is a dark spot on the screen, a slight scratch on the casing, the sound of the CD-ROM drive, a bit like Ferrari... 
1	I am very impressed that zoologists a hundred years ago were able to write such good popular science books suitable for children’s tastes. Even an adult like me has also learned a lot of knowledge. When we read the first book, we read it together with parents and children. Later the children read it by themselves. I really can't put it down. I watched it before going to bed at night, and after getting up in the morning, I lay my ass on the bed and watched it. What needs to be reminded is: if your child is young, under 8 years old, it is best that you can help him consolidate the effect of reading, such as asking questions about the knowledge in the book. In short, the book is very good! It's worth buying! 
0	The network speed is fast and the VPN is convenient to connect to the company's intranet. The IT person in charge has set up the network well and praised it. But the attitude of the front desk staff is not up to the satisfactory standard. The hotel does not have an iron. Because I want to see customers, I have to iron a shirt. I said 5 yuan, but when I checked out, I asked for 8 yuan. It was said that the service fee and the rush fee were 3 yuan. When I opened the door of the glass shower room, I realized that my right hand must be at least 2 meters long to reach the bath towel, so I had to drip water out to get it. After thinking about it, bath towels can't be brought into the small shower room. I don't know who designed it. Did not find more advantages than other hotels, 560 yuan spent a little bit wronged by the ocean, no longer come. 
1	The appearance of the machine is very good, and the HP brand is also very trustworthy. In terms of configuration, I feel very cost-effective 
0	The other thing to say is that the heat dissipation design of this book is really amazing. The cpu and north bridge chip are covered with an aluminum sheet, which is very thin and light, and the fan only serves to draw air and let the air flow. This kind of heat dissipation is very worrying. I don't know if other netbooks are designed like this. 
1	It's better than expected. It seems that Golden Key Alliance still has certain quality control. The room facilities are OK, but the smell of smoke is too strong. When I came back, my pajamas were full of smoke. Breakfast is very average, with few options. But the service ecology of Pakistan is very good. Right on the Yalu River, the surrounding environment is okay 
0	There is no big disadvantage, anyway, netbooks can’t require too much performance. The disadvantage is that after reinstalling XP, it feels that the running speed is not as fast as expected. 
0	When my boyfriend saw the introduction of the book in the newspaper, he was blown up, so he asked me to buy one for him. The Dangdang party was very fast, and I received it in three days. I read it. I'm just a rubbish book. Now that I have bought a book, I have begun to make a wonderful work, and it makes people not live! I think, it is better to go to some diet network to see that it is better than this book! 
0	In a word, that is pretty bad! This is also called 3 stars, is there any mistake, the hotel level is not. The hall is upside down. The smell of disinfectant in the room was so great that I couldn't get used to it for half an hour. The things in the bathroom feel like they have entered a 50 yuan store, with cement paste glass joints. God, I am ashamed and thrown home. Strongly request a refund! 
1	Checked in again a week later. This time I booked a business double room. It seems that the original deluxe double room cannot be booked. The business room has a fax machine, a bathtub in the bathroom and a large window on the wall. But it seems to be small, the price is more than 100 yuan is acceptable, but I still think the deluxe room is practical and the room is more spacious. There was fruit delivery in the room this time, I don't know if it is because of the business room. The hotel is still very comfortable, and the details still need to be improved, such as the large windows on the wall between the bathroom and the room, the glass is very beautiful, but can you consider installing blinds, or it will be inconvenient for visitors to use the bathroom in the room. This time the restaurant did not turn off the lights at 8pm, and it seemed to be still open. I wonder if the comments made last time worked, so I should like it. The hotel used to have an underground parking lot. This time my car was parked underground. Although it is more complicated to go up and down the stairs, there is ample space for parking. The man in charge of the garage is very responsible and feels good. 
0	It is much heavier than I thought, and there are too few USB ports. Also, the VISTA system is too slow to start, which may be the reason why I am not used to it. 
1	My baby likes it very much, now he is one year old and nine months old. But I bought it when he was 8 months old, and I saw the comments and thought it was good, so let's take a look. When he was one year old, he was able to understand the book of Gale and liked it very much. After reading it many times, he was able to notice the tiny things in the picture, and he often asked and answered himself, which was very cute. And the content and quality of this picture book are good, as long as the baby likes it, I am very satisfied. He is not very interested in some of the sets. I think he will like it as he grows older! 
0	However, it is best to install the Vista system. I have installed two different ghostXPs and there are some minor problems. It is best to install Vista only. I haven’t found anything wrong. 
0	The location is recognized as good, but there are many disadvantages, mainly because the elevator is slow, the corridor is narrow, the room facilities are a bit outdated, it is OK to stay for one night temporarily, it is not recommended to stay for a long time. 
0	"After reading it, the printed book is quite exquisite, but the content: the mumbling of the kimchi woman is very ordinary! The overall feeling of this book is ""not as famous as meeting each other."" It is recommended to go online to download a copy and just watch it, don’t buy it. "
1	I think I love Sun Bo. . . Her love is so simple and so hot. I think in the deepest part of her heart, the person she loves is still Xiao Lang. . . There are waves, there are waves. . . There are waves when there are waves. very classic. . I am holding this book. Read every word carefully. Their love and hatred. I think if I do it again. They will definitely be together. Although it has been full of sadness and ups and downs from the beginning. However, I can always feel that their love is so real. . . . 
1	The hotel's facilities are very good, the rooms are big, the facilities are new, and the beds and quilts are very new. The toilet is also separated from wet and dry. The waiter's attitude is also very good, and they will greet them when they come in and out. In the lobby of the restaurant, there are too few tables for 2-3 people. Also, the housing prices in Quzhou should be on the high side. 
1	The customer came to visit the Foshan factory and arranged to be in this old-fashioned Samsung hotel. Although the room facilities are a little bit successful, the price is not expensive. The key is that it is located in the city center and it is very convenient for shopping and eating. For this price, it's not bad. 
0	Domestic foundry, the design of the battery part is unreasonable. After the battery is installed, the side parallel to the keyboard is a little higher, and it may touch the screen. 
1	The view of the lake view room is very good! The hotel is also very clean, but the facilities are slightly older. The traffic is very convenient! Taxis in Xiamen are too expensive, and it is very convenient to take buses from the hotel to various attractions. However, the hotel’s breakfast is average, with fewer choices and repeated almost every day. 
1	The stuff is good, I bought memory and other accessories in a package, and the prices of other things are not cheap, but the computer itself is good, after all, there is no need to run. 
1	Jingdong processing speed is very fast; the screen does not say; the keyboard feels good (mainly buying such a brand at this point); there is a joystick; 
1	"This is not so much a novel, as it is a simple and systematic self-improvement package. If you can follow the ""chew and eat slowly"" dining rules, you will definitely benefit a lot and will benefit your life. In the book, the author allows Ruoling to lead the readers, step by step to approach his true nature, explore himself, discover himself, accept himself, improve himself, and finally perfect himself. It points out a shortcut to communicate with the Buddha of the self. The book is easy to read, and contains profound philosophy in the ease. It is a rare spiritual teaching material! "
1	"When the child asked how was born? Why do you dodge when there are topics such as children and avoid the more important things? Perhaps this is the way most parents prevaricate their children. It's not that I don't want to say it, but I really don't know how to say it, and how to start, because our parents also regarded this kind of problem very evasively and vaguely. Occasionally I found this book ""Telling Children the Truth"" in the library to make me brainwash myself. It is a normal thing in itself, and it is often complicated by adults. This book taught me how to guide my children about sex and love. Naturally, it is a good book. . . . ! "
1	The service is acceptable, the room size is moderate, but the bedding and facilities are quite outdated. Hotel feedback January 14, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of our service, and we will work hard in other aspects. Welcome to visit again! 
0	To be honest, I have been booking a room with the co-cheng, and I have always found it very convenient, but this time the room here is almost impossible to live in, even if it is attached to the side of the exhibition center, it is not such a fool. If you have a car, you still live in the city and drive. The venue is also convenient. We used to live in Xujiahui and came by car. As a result, when we entered the door: the walls were mottled, the windows leaked, and we went up and banged (steel floor), like a work shed. The room at night was very It's cold, and the air conditioner is useless at 30 degrees! If you don't have a car, choose to stay next to the subway, which is also convenient. Anyway, don't live here in Shanghai Pudong!! 
1	A group of 8 of us booked two deluxe rooms with sea view and one deluxe standard room. We accidentally stayed in room 2104 with our family. The view was really good. Not only could we see the sea, but also the city and the night view. The room is really big, clean and tidy, with complete facilities. The disadvantage is that the window glass is a bit dirty, the window can only be opened a little, the ceiling by the window is leaking, two basins have been placed to collect water when entering, and the faucet in the bathroom is too high and the shower cannot be adjusted. , The water is too open. The surrounding environment is also very good. It is convenient for eating and shopping. A Taiwanese restaurant next to the hotel tastes quite good. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied. If I have the opportunity to come to Weihai again, I will stay here. 
1	Checking in again a few months later, a female staff member in the lobby called me by my name, which was very unusual. The service has nothing to say, the location of the hotel is also very good, located in the center of Weihai. 
0	I bought it after reading the comments of other readers. I don't know why many people think it is good. After reading a third, I really feel that there is nothing to say; I feel that there is no gain, and the content in it can be found by searching online. Not very helpful, it is the most disappointing book I have bought so far. 
1	I just finished reading the first part of the bean sprouts collection. The overall feeling is that I want to write whatever I want. The characters, events, feelings, memories, and scenery are all like this. When I first look at it, I feel rough, but I still feel reasonable when I taste it. Although everyone is in a different environment, these short words can from time to time touch a certain string in your heart. Sometimes there are many different feelings about the scenes or things she describes, but it is this difference that makes you feel that you can keep reading. Just write as you like, just read as you like, very good! Easy! 
1	"""Old Things in the South"" is the first literary book I read when I was in college. I didn't notice that it was originally written by a famous artist. I was only deeply attracted by the old photo-like scene and the slightly sentimental smooth text in the aftertaste. Now again Finding her and cherishing her is a souvenir of college life and a reflection of the past years. I like the words of Yingzi’s father the most: “No matter what is difficult, as long as you bite the bullet and do it, you will pass through.” I also “break through” many things in the past between wandering and firmness. I am very lucky to read this. Text. "
1	Every time I book a hotel, I read reviews on the Internet and found that this hotel has a good review and the price is reasonable. In addition to booking a room by myself, I also booked a room for clients. After I arrived, it was really good. The hotel took into account my contact with customers and upgraded my room. It’s the first time I encountered an upgrade, so happy. The rooms are spacious, clean, and the waiters are friendly and deliver fruits. Because of geographic reasons, the scenery outside the window is not very good. But he was relatively close to Vientiane City, and he was very happy to take a stroll with the customer. If you go to Shenzhen again, if you don't go to Hong Kong, you still live here. Because I was busy, it took 20 days to comment. If you go to Hong Kong, choose Rujia Fishing Village Store. There are restaurants, fruit shops and pharmacies downstairs, which is very convenient. It's just a bit hard to find. 
0	Are the quality you bought? It’s incredible. After I bought it, the first impression I felt was that the packaging was too bad. The CD cobbled in the carton and it was easy to rub. I tried it. There were 10 discs in total, and 7 of them couldn’t be read. It's really cheap and not good. It is recommended to be careful if you want to buy it. The quality is not as good as the pirated version. It should be a bad pirated version. 
0	The hotel is average, and the most unbearable is the harassment call. It can ring 4 to 5 times a night and calls every night. It is only true for single male guests. The information is very accurate. It is seriously suspected that the lady has banned the front desk staff and got the guests. Check-in information. Living in such a room is very uneasy. 
0	: The appearance is beautiful, each function indicator is also very good-looking, the price is cheaper than Zhongguancun. It is more suitable for girls, watching movies and listening to music sound effects 
0	After installing the XP system, the wireless network card driver is difficult to find. After the installation, the signal is very unstable, and I don’t know what the problem is. When the CD-ROM drive is turned on, there is a karaoke sound 
1	The appearance is good, the keyboard is comfortable, and the touchpad is easy to use. The screen is good, the top screen of the Fujitsu series (more appreciated). There are cameras, Bluetooth, wireless, card reader, DVD burning, fingerprints. Anyway, the equipment is very complete. 
0	The only advantage of this hotel is its good location, close to Xujiahui subway station, and convenient for shopping. The soundproofing of the rooms is quite poor, the mattresses are also very hard, the breakfast is basically nothing to eat, and the attitude of the waiters is very average. There is an additional charge for Internet access, 44 a day, 0.44 a minute, the Internet speed is okay, but the connection is old. The attitude of the front desk staff is average, the restaurant staff is even worse, basically just standing there and chatting together. In the future, I would rather stay far away, and may not choose this hotel. 
1	The environment of the hotel is good, it is very good in the local area, the room is relatively large, but the equipment is average.

1	Quite good, the quality of the licensed product is guaranteed. As for the price, it is affordable, although it is more expensive than parallel imports. Bluetooth, camera, and fingerprint are not necessary 
0	Watching a movie and listening to music under LINUX will get stuck, but installing XP is so troublesome. I have always been out of luck!! 
0	Advantages: It is located in a prosperous area and the waiters are very friendly. Disadvantages: Because it is on the road, it is noisy at night, and I didn't sleep well all night. Returned to the room at noon the next day and found that the room was not cleaned. Hotel Feedback August 13, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay at Westlake Four Seasons Hotel. I apologize for the unpleasant hotel you stayed in this time. If you have certain requirements for the room cleaning time, please dial the push-to-talk on the landline in the room, and the front desk will notify the housekeeper to clean your room in time. Thank you for your review and look forward to seeing you again! 
1	The overall service is good, but the room is too poorly insulated, the sound in the corridor is like in the room, and the breakfast is ok 
1	"The son is one year old and eight months old. This set of books, my son has to take out several copies every day to let me tell him. And it has a great influence on children's behavior. For example: sleep. The child always plays until eleven or two o’clock every day and still refuses to go to bed. Yesterday I saw that he was still very energetic, but it was not too early. It was eleven o’clock. So I let the child lie down and turned off the light. Filming him while slowly ""sleeping"" the story in this series, alas, he soon stopped making trouble and fell asleep. If he usually lay down for half an hour, he couldn't calm down. "
1	I went to Beijing on a business trip with my colleague. After checking in advance, I chose the China Shipbuilding Hotel, so I booked two rooms at the China Shipbuilding Hotel on Ctrip.com for May 17-20. The plane was delayed for 3 hours that day. I was worried that I would not be able to check into the hotel on the scheduled time, so I called the hotel reception after arriving in Beijing and requested to reserve the room. The receptionist enthusiastically replied that he would keep it, so he felt relieved. Zhongchuan Hotel is located in Yuetan North Street, which is about 100 meters north of Sanlihe East Road and 50 meters to the north of Yuetan North Street. The location is quite quiet. In the middle of the night, the guest room is not affected by the sound of people and vehicles outside, and is suitable for rest. I stayed in a double bed room, the total area of ​​the room is about 4.5 meters 3 meters = 13.5 square meters, of which: the bathroom is about 1.5 meters 2 meters = 3 square meters (about one bed), the bedroom is about 2.8 meters 3 meters = 8.4 square meters. The floor in the bedroom is a bit like a wooden floor. There is a 1.5-meter wide bed, a wooden wardrobe, a bedside cabinet, a round table, 2 chairs, and a long wooden table (including a square stool). Color TV, desk lamp, electric kettle and 4 cups, jasmine tea on the round table. The room is equipped with self-adjustable air conditioning. The most satisfying one is that there is basically no musty smell that many hotels often smell in the room, and the smell is good; the other is that the pillows, quilts, sheets, stools and bedding are neat and clean, obviously they should be newly purchased items. The bathroom is also relatively clean, with hot water supply throughout the day, but the sound insulation effect is slightly weak. The guests in the next room switch on the faucet in the bathroom, and there is an obvious sound of water coming. The waiter cleans the room in time every day, and his behavior is standard and civilized. Overall, the room is quite satisfactory as a personal rest. There is a restaurant next to the main desk on the first floor of the hotel. Breakfast is a buffet every day. The charge is 10 yuan (which can be added to the room rate). Generally there are fried dough sticks, fried noodles, steamed buns, steamed buns, flower rolls, boiled eggs, tea eggs, fried poached eggs, The supply of corn porridge, mung bean porridge, soy milk, milk, cold dishes, pickles, fermented bean curd and other dishes is quite plentiful and more worthwhile. You can easily get a taxi from the hotel. The famous Financial Street is not far to the east of the hotel, and the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse is not far to the west. The fare from Yuetan North Street to Xidan is about 12 yuan. I walked back to the hotel from Xidan one night. About 1 hour, if everyone is okay, you can go around and take a look, it's convenient. There are some food stalls around the hotel, such as snacks, food stalls, etc. It is very convenient to eat. After leaving the hotel, walk more than 200 meters north and there is a 24-hour convenience store, where you can buy many daily necessities suitable for consumption at any time. 
1	The hotel facilities are very good, the service is also very attentive, especially the front desk, and welcome guests, very warm, thank them! 
0	I bought it when it looked cheap. It’s not good enough, but it’s no benefit after reading it. It’s fine to find an online reading online, there is no need to waste ten yuan 
0	The hotel is terrible for the price. The lobby is very bad and dirty. I booked a business suite. There were no windows in the living room and the lights were dim. All the toiletries including towels were of poor quality. The room has a smell. My laptop went online up and down, and then it couldn’t be connected anymore. I had to use my own wireless and it was better than it. Anyway, I won’t consider this one anymore. 
1	The hotel is located in a very central place, the room is also good, there is a Fushan Park next to it. The breakfast variety is not very rich. 
1	The environment is first-rate, with deep courtyards, small bridges and running water, withered vines and old trees. Stayed multiple times. It's just that the breakfast is extremely bleak, regardless of Chinese and Western, hope to improve. 
0	I bought this so-called best-selling book for the first time. I wanted to be educated. Maybe there are too many books on philosophy. I feel that the author’s writing is very brainless and plain as water... a good book, or it can be received Inspiring, let people learn to think, or be purely pragmatic. This book reads something that a little girl wrote. It is neither long-learned nor pragmatic. It is purely on paper and relatively superficial. It is not worth reading. In other words None of my books can fit on my bookshelf. Reading such books is a waste of time. 
1	The price/performance ratio is very high! The original bag that comes with it is also very good. I brought it up by myself. I visited it once (at the point on Zhangyang Road in Shanghai). Compared with the last time, the improvement is: it provides DIY seats for customers and has wireless network. Access service, good 
1	Twenty-Four History, 63 in total, Zhonghua Book Company. How can you not be moved by these irritating words? It is like the process of buying a set of comics when I was young: first go to the bookstore to choose the version and price, then go through it again and again, and finally go through many comparisons and choices, and finally Look for opportunities to ask parents. After requesting from his wife, immediately take out part of the stock income and buy more. These things can be left to the son and can also affect his growth. After moving home, immediately move the old books in the bookcase to the bottom of the bed and put these brilliant works in a conspicuous place. 
1	"This is a practical book, with its concise language attached to Montesquieu's background, equality of life, and a brief description of other works, just like a short biography of a biography! The main theme of ""The Spirit of the Law"": anti-church, anti-authoritarianism, separation of powers, geographical environment determinism, etc., are reflected one by one. It can be called Montesquieu's ""Spirit of the Law"", a collection of punch lines and heart words. For friends who want to know Montesquieu, but are limited by time and energy to read the original work, this is a good choice! It involves Chinese ingredients, which can be called the advantage of this book! "
0	Look at the online comments, oh my son who bought it. But I think it is for such a small child to read when it is clothed. Children are not interested, this book should be suitable for children over 6 years old. And the story is not interesting. 
1	The environment and service are quite good. The biggest shortcoming is that it is very inconvenient to call in the morning. Often need to wait 10 minutes 
1	The thing is very small, the appearance is very beautiful, with the effect of pearl paint, the appearance process is still good, the plastic mold is good, and the speed is quite good. 
0	The wireless function needs to be turned on again with the combination key every time you turn on it. Installing the system by yourself is more troublesome, and you need to resolve various software conflicts and Internet settings. It is necessary to fill in too much personal information when registering the battery extension card. 
0	The hotel claims to be the best in Manzhouli at the moment. I was disappointed as soon as I entered. The rooms are small, unclean, incomplete facilities, and the hotel service is very slow. It provides a fee-based wireless network, which is as fast as a cart, and it often breaks. The buffet on the first floor is also very poor. Generally speaking, it is not a recommended hotel, but in places like Manzhouli, you have little room for other options unless the new Shangri-La Hotel is completed. 
0	The hotel is very old, small and dark in the corridors. It is actually a small hotel. Recommend not to go, Jilin Province Hotel is not bad. 
1	"I have always wanted to own and read all of Zhang Ailing’s works. I really like the Shanghai taste in her bones. Despite the age and the transformation of time and space, it still reads like yesterday’s events around me. I didn’t find it until Dangdang. All the works (""Small Reunion"" is still for reading, I'm sorry!). The Sri Lankan has gone, just wanting to find her shadow again, just like revisiting the ignorance, agitation, and impulse of holding a yellow book of ""Red Roses and White Roses"" in childhood. Thank you Dangdang for his thoughtful service, and I am sorry that it is time to express my opinion today. "
1	It’s the first time that I bought such expensive items with notebooks. At the beginning, I was a little worried because I didn’t know if JD’s Dongdong was good or not. Now I feel that buying things on JD.com is really cheap, very good, and very good. The goods are super fast. I ordered the goods yesterday and received them today. Next time I will definitely buy things on Jingdong again. 
1	In a sad and depressing day, read this book. Those times that have been seen on tiptoe have unknowingly become the eternal passage of time. On the beautiful high school campus, I am no longer an experiencer, but a past person. Behind the text, there is a familiar and cordial taste. Those growing up stories, you and I have experienced more or less. It also grows in a similar way. Like Jidi, MY WAY uses color and text. Give strength continuously. From the depths of my heart, warmth rose slowly. In any case, smile. Be brave to meet my future. 
1	The transportation is convenient, and the price is relatively low near the International Exhibition Center. It is reasonable to stay here for the exhibition. The hotel front desk mistaken my booking information on Ctrip and didn't even admit it. The quality of the service staff was a bit poor. 
0	The performance is a bit worse than expected. When watching movies online, the fan keeps spinning, and it feels a bit difficult to run. 
1	I bought it for my sister, but she told me that she bought it too. It’s good to give to other friends 
0	The price of this book is too expensive, and it is not suitable for children over 5 years old. The pages are too few and expensive to buy! It's not worth buying. 
1	The pictures that the child saw in other books first, a set of three books, including why I hate that girl, hate to wear pants, hate to drink milk, the child reads it and asks me what book it is, and I am most interested at first Why do you hate wearing pants, but after a few days of comparison, she decided to buy why I hate that girl (I stipulate that I can only choose one book at a time). When you first bought it, you had to talk about it every day, or even at a time several times a day. If you listened too much, if you didn't tell her, she would talk about it by herself. Not bad. But I am a little worried whether it will mislead the little girl's thoughts. 
1	"Seeing the rave reviews from readers, I was ready to be moved, but I was a little disappointed. I also wrote about cancer, I appreciate the great ""good time"", and I was so touched that I burst into tears. Although Li Chuan was very affectionate in this story, he was too stubborn. He didn't figure out what the other party really wanted until the end, leaving the beloved to suffer for many years. Readers are tired looking at it. Why don't they support each other and live cherishly when there are not many days left? Maybe it's because I don't agree with Li Chuan's approach, so it's hard to resonate. "
1	"After reading the introduction of the book, I bought it and tried to show it to my son. I didn't want my son to let it go. The paintings in these books are extremely exquisite, and the meaning is clear. Children can understand at a glance. They are indeed the masterpieces of picture book master Messer Meyer. Although there is not a single text in the whole book, through the pictures, the author wants to express the meaning very clearly, and the humorous ""telling"" process allows children to know why they want friends, what the friendship between friends is, and how to treat new friends . These are the same things that young children will face. Through pictures, they can understand the truth more profoundly. "
0	The deluxe single room booked is 1/3 smaller than the double room, and the facilities are also poor, even without coffee table and armchair, but the price is much more expensive than the double room, it is really incredible! I am a frequent visitor of the double room in this hotel. Perhaps the hotel itself felt unreliable. When I was out, I quietly moved in two armchairs and swapped out the back chairs in the original room. But because the room space is too small, the chairs can’t actually be seated. Can put things in! The front desk service was not bad. I forgot to bring my ID card. I told it to be a frequent visitor. I checked my computer information and let me move in. 
0	The style of this machine is really ordinary, the plastic feel is too strong, and the baffle is very thin when the back cover is removed. The memory is not the DDR2 667 mentioned on the Internet is 800, but I bought the 667 memory, I don’t know if I can dual-channel 
0	I was very happy when I saw the book, and the printing quality was good, but after only reading it for a day, the page fell off, and I was depressed after reading one page. I don't know how to explain Dangdang? 
1	InterContinental Hotels, Ctrip's prices are indeed competitive. It should be the cheapest five-star hotel in Shenyang. 1) Geographical location: It is located near Taiyuan Street, a commercial street, with convenient transportation, but there are always traffic jams at the door. It is recommended to get off the hotel opposite the hotel and cross the road if you take a taxi. 2) The room: very small, but you can see a good street view. 3) The fitness center does not take photos, and other similar hotels do not have this requirement. 4) The concierge service is not good. Maybe because Shenyang is too cold in winter, no one will come out to welcome guests. 5) The worst point is: ask the concierge to take a taxi to the airport. Before boarding the car, I asked the hotel staff whether to charge a meter. After confirmation, I boarded the car. When I arrived at the airport, I asked for a price. Shout 100! ! At that time, the reason for catching the plane was not investigated. Afterwards, I complained to InterContinental, which has not been resolved yet. Quite disappointed! 
0	Such a hotel is average, the front desk staff kindly reminded that the reserved room is a bit noisy (near the elevated), because only such a room has charged broadband. After checking the room, it feels okay, but the waiter can't wait for 10 minutes and then go downstairs to register, but ask It must be registered immediately, as if worried that we might steal their things. 
0	The instructions are relatively simple to write. The Samsung memory provided with this notebook does not know how to install it. Although it is written in the manual, but because I don’t have experience in this area, I plan to go to the warranty point and let a professional help me install it, so it’s a little troublesome. . 
0	It must be a luxurious suite, but it is not luxurious at all. It is not convenient to take a taxi around the hotel, especially when commuting to and from get off work, there is no subway or bus, and there are no restaurants around. The breakfast in the hotel is relatively poor, the restaurant is small, there are many people eating, and there is very little food. Too close to the track, the train shook across the mountain. I stayed for 5 days, and I never mentioned a midway check-out. Finally, Ctrip told me that I checked out after only 2 days of staying. Although it was resolved in the end, it was very uncomfortable. The only good thing is that the hotel staff are relatively good. enthusiasm 
1	It has been a month since I bought this book, because there was an mbti course before, and I didn’t go to it because of time. Later, I wanted to collect some information in this area on the Internet. I also chose it first after reading other people's comments. Compared with another book of the same MBTI [Talent Difference], it is less professional, more practical, and more involved in work. Those who want to use MBTI can buy it for reference. It is recommended to look at it in conjunction with [Talent Difference], it will benefit more. 
1	The hotel covers a large area and is known as a garden style. The Yingbin building where I live is in very general condition and fairly clean. There is no broadband on the first floor. It is said that there is only on the third and fourth floors. Because I booked it in advance, when I arrived, I found that the extra bed had been added in advance, which was not bad. Considering that it is in Anqing and the house price is still cheap, everything is not a concern. 
1	Worthy of the price of 3799, the motherboard is poor, so it is cheap, but there are some, you can play ordinary games 
1	The environment is good, the interior color is very warm, MM is very satisfied! It's just that the windows are too sloppy, and when you open the curtains, it feels messy. The most inadequate place is the shower. One is that the place is too small, and the other is that the water is large and sometimes small during the bath, and there is a few seconds in between! ! 
1	I placed the order at the end of get off work and planned to pick up the goods at noon and afternoon yesterday. I was not ready when I arrived at 13 o'clock yesterday afternoon. I waited for more than ten minutes to pick up the goods. 
0	The big and scary picture is a bit scary for adults. I don't like it very much, and my son doesn't like it very much either. Too big children, such as those over three years old, feel too simple. They only say a single sentence with two pages, which does not have much educational significance. However, children under three feel scary. I regret choosing this book. It really feels like this. 
1	Cheap and good value for money. Breakfast: relatively monotonous. 
1	Nice hotel, I often stay in, and I am familiar with the surroundings and hotel environment. 
1	Reading a novel, especially a reading to commemorate first love, why care about so much meaning, as long as when you see it, you can remember your innocence, persistence, desperateness, and fleeing in the end. This book does it. At first, watching Sun Jiayu and Zhao Mei, there will be a soft smile on the corner of the mouth, a little trance unreal, and later, like many people, there will be tears falling gently, since our uniqueness cannot be remembered , Let the author replace us, and recall the initial touch! 
0	It is recommended to book another hotel to save heartache, because this hotel is so bad in my opinion 
1	"Picking up this book several times, I could not read it anymore after reading only the ten conventions at the beginning, and tears filled my eyes every time. It is a touching agreement. These ten agreements are not only the agreement between ""me"" and the dog, but also the desire and pursuit of love among relatives. Finally, I continued reading. The author's writing was fresh and natural, as if a friend around me was telling his own story. The writing of the translation is also very fluent, and it can be seen that it is translated with emotion, so it is very infectious. It is a good book worth collecting and will be read to my baby in the future. "
0	"I bought this book together with the ""Don’t call me English vocabulary book"". After I received it, I can see the heights on the cover. Looking through the content and layout, this book is really too general. I don’t have the desire to read, and I haven’t turned 10 pages yet; some of the content is not very professional and not worth looking at "
1	In the Thinkpad brand, the price/performance ratio is relatively high. I feel that the heat is a little too large. Fortunately, the sound of the time drive is louder when the time drive is started. 2G memory is enough. 
1	There is HDMI and SD card reader. There are no dead pixels when you buy it, which is good. JD’s packaging is also good, which can avoid damage to the machine during transportation. Overall it is satisfactory. 
1	The people around you actually finished reading this book one by one. When each of them introduced it to others, no one praised it, but simply said: Look good, let's take a look. After reading it, everyone chose to be silent, without even sighing, what they wanted to say, but there was only a sigh in one mouth. I think this is the power of a good book. It can make you immersed in your heart. You feel shocked, but you can't discuss it with words. For the first time, you feel the language is pale. It seems that everyone is tacitly tacitly aware and acquiesces to retain their own feelings. 
0	I can’t stand it. There were cockroaches, and 3 cockroaches were eliminated. As a 4-star hotel, I was disappointed, and the internet speed was too slow. 
1	I didn’t intend to read this book and bought it. This may also be a kind of fate, (because my health is not good, I have been in medical treatment, what other people say is good, I will try it after weighing it ----- written in the book The content of is close to life, and food is easy to find. Just follow the instructions and believe that the body will gradually get better. When using items that are helpful to the body, please trust it, feel it, be grateful for it, and the body will absorb it better .I believe that the health of the body in the future is the contribution of this book and the author. I hope that more friends will be happy and healthy! 
0	When I received the book, I looked at it and found it to be general. I feel that I have extracted and sorted out various Chinese medicine books and processed it in my own language, and the writing is very rough, like talking casually. Like a book. Regret buying! I don’t know what the author’s job is, but as far as this book is concerned, it’s very unprofessional. Maybe it’s a writer addiction that anyone can publish a book after thinking about it! 
1	The reason for buying this book is that the boss was introduced to an investment company in Beijing, which can raise funds for us. The boss is very happy because of the simple procedures, large financing amount and low interest rates. When the other party brought the financing information, it felt like they were doing a private equity fund, so I quickly bought this book to read. At first glance, it turns out that it was an unreliable transaction using people's mystery of private equity funds. Financing naturally failed, but a lot of knowledge has been gained, and a very useful book. 
0	The sense of plastic is too strong, on the same level as Asus, Lenovo, and HP. If you use it yourself, consider thinkpad, macbook, etc. 
0	The service consciousness of the hotel is very poor, and the restaurant cannot sign the order because it is afraid that the consumption is higher than the pre-authorization. The waiter was obviously not trained. 
0	The printing quality of the book is so poor that it feels like a pirated copy. The quality is not the same as other books bought by Dangdang. Fortunately, the content is not fake. 
0	I have never spent 500 yuan in a room like this... 1. Towards the light rail, cannot sleep in 2. The soundproofing is not good. There seems to be a ballroom upstairs, which is very noisy 3. The bed is very hard and very Hard 4. The room is very small and the most unbearable thing is that in Shanghai in May, the weather is so hot, and I found that there is no air-conditioning, and I asked about the service by telephone. I replied: I am sorry that we are central air-conditioning. If so, I ask the waiter to send you an electric fan... I did not accept her suggestion, so it was sultry all night... Very dissatisfied with this hotel 
0	The content is average, too single! I think education is not very profound. There are not many Liezi in real life, it is meaningless! 
1	The classic shape, the piano paint is very beautiful. It looks very comfortable! The performance of the machine is also very good, and the speed is very fast. Nothing to say about IBM! 
0	It is a little troublesome when changing the XP system, there is no Acer ePower Management power management software in the CD. 
1	The door of the hotel looks very stylish, the lobby is very individual, and the rooms maintain the same style, with green wood grain and masonry walls, simple without losing personality, much like an express hotel. It's worth it in terms of price. 
0	How do you look at the story after a period of time is not over yet, and other things are said, then the previous story is followed. Sometimes it makes me mess up, and it depends on what was said in the previous paragraph before I continue. Is the printing wrong? 
1	The content of the book is good, that is, the corners of the book are slightly broken when the book is delivered. This book was originally viewed on the Internet, but when I wanted to buy it, it was out of stock. Now it is put back again, Gu I bought it for collection and read it in my free time. In fact, for a woman, a man can write such a delicate text is really a surprise to me. It is light and light but it is deeply moving, not so vigorous, But it is heart-shattering. As others have said, in the end there is a feeling of unfinishedness, and I always feel that there is a continuation. But the story is endless, but the book always has an ending... Not bad. 
1	I lived in a 350 big bed room. According to the four-star standard, the furniture is too old, the room is too small, and the breakfast variety is single.Generally speaking, it is OK, the location is good, and the service is good. 
1	Toshiba's books are indeed okay, at this price, the configuration is not bad, in short, the price/performance ratio is not bad. 
1	Stay at this hotel: the software and hardware are better, and the price is reasonable. However, the parking garage cannot directly enter the hotel. It is not very convenient to enter the garage from the front door. But next time you come to Taiyuan, she is the first choice. 
1	The price is reduced too fast~ I had to wait a few more days if I found it earlier, and it dropped by 500 in just one month. Now I also send a wireless router. Cry~~~ 
0	The only thing that feels insufficient is that the hard disk is divided into two drives, each with more than 100G, if it can be divided into 3 or more, it would be nice 
1	According to colleagues, all aspects are good, next time they are on a business trip, they still hope to stay in this hotel. 
1	The appearance is the key point. It is indeed pretty, a bit of an imac style, but I don’t know what black is rubbed on the machine I got, but it can be wiped off. What makes me most depressed is the rating of the graphics card under vista. It is even higher than my y430! I have to know that my 430 is the best match, the p8400cpu model, I am depressed~~~~ I bought it for my girlfriend, she is super satisfied, I also think it is good, I lost another 100 yuan in time, depressed~ 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the white keyboard is eye-catching, and the function keys are set reasonably; the keyboard material is good and the touch is solid; the touchpad is bumped, and the feel is good, and it has a simple touch zoom function, which is more practical; P7450 is currently the best Core 2 Low-power processor, 512MB graphics card is very good and powerful for playing games, and the graphics card is also relatively high-end at this level; after a trial, under the conditions of daily use, the battery is fully charged and can be used for 4 hours in the balance setting; plus The upper battery is not heavy, taking into account performance and weight. 
0	"I have read a lot of books adapted into TV series, and I feel that books are better than TV. This time is an exception. The book is almost exactly the same as the TV. The writing is not detailed enough, which is a bit disappointing. And the changes regarding Xu Sanduo are a bit unacceptable. How could someone who had performed so badly in all aspects before suddenly became ""distantly ahead"" after turning the horizontal bar? If he catches up with the others through hard work, how can he suddenly surpass the Shi Jin and others who were much better than him? Is it because everyone else has fallen behind, or has he become a genius himself? I have been a soldier myself, and I have seen many hardworking people, but I have never seen such a rapid progress. "
1	The room is small but very clean! Feels a little home, will live in the future! 
0	It's a bad hotel, it's a hotel. It feels a bit bad. The lobby is like a temporary one. There is no security guard at the door. There are bicycles parked next to the window, so there is no sense of security. The hotel facilities are outdated, the beds are small and difficult to sleep, no pure water is provided, and the boiling water is very difficult to drink. The condition of the bathroom is not as good as that of a better guest house. The breakfast style is less and unpalatable. This is the worst star hotel I've ever stayed in, and it is incomparable with a budget hotel. I really don't know why Ctrip would recommend it. 
0	The heat is too big, not long after it was turned on, the machine was very hot only when connected to the Internet, the GPU did not go below 50 degrees, and the cp has been above 44 degrees. I don’t know if it is normal or there is a problem with this one, hope Someone advise~ 
1	It is five-star, the room is relatively small, and the network is still problematic, but the service staff has a relatively strong business ability and it is quickly settled 
1	My twin son is 5 years old and they like it very much. When I was reading to them, they were quiet and listened attentively. In the middle, I was so moved that I couldn’t read it, but the children didn’t urge, but looked at me strangely and waited quietly for me to continue reading&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183 ;&#183;&#183; Many mothers in the front said that the child shed tears, my son did not, but frowned, and asked me with a heavy expression: Is it dead? Seems to become sensible? ! 
0	I liked this cartoon very much. The description clearly stated that the dialogue was bilingual in Chinese and English, with bilingual subtitles in Chinese and English, without any duplication. When I bought it, I found that there were Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck inside Jingran, and there was no Chinese dialogue and subtitles at all. What's more annoying is that there are repetitions. Too wicked. con man! 
0	The rooms in Taihe Building are not bad. Single check-in and check-out procedures are too long. When checking in, first tell me that the room is not cleaned up, but I cannot check in and put my luggage into the room first (because there are other things in a hurry). After the room was OK, it took 40 minutes to complete the check-in procedure. 
0	First of all, I bought it after reading your reviews. I admit I was fooled. The book is very thin. The books I used to buy for my children are basically much thicker than this. This one is very small and has no texture. I read 15 books stacked together and the thickness is less than 5 cm. In addition, the binding is very poor. Each book is fixed with a staple. Such a book is very dangerous for children. My little treasure has been cut by such a book before. Children are not so honest in reading, so The books I buy in the future are all without nails. Everyone is optimistic about it. If you want to understand it, buy it again. Don’t read the comments. It’s good. The price is not expensive. I bought it for a long time. I just threw it away. It’s useless. 
1	The configuration of similar notebooks is relatively practical, the appearance is simple and generous, there is an hdmi high-definition interface, and the cpu-z test memory is modern ddr2 800 
0	I have booked a hotel on Ctrip so many times, the worst hotel I have encountered. Living in an executive deluxe room, I didn't even have hot water for bathing when I got up at 7:30 in the morning. When issuing the invoice, it said that there is no invoice. Please Ctrip for help. Don't put this kind of hotel on your website to harm others. Thank you! 
1	made in japan The workmanship is good. My original S6130 is made in Malaysia. After a few days of use, the system stability is good, the screen display is excellent, and the battery time is okay. 3 hours. 
1	Each ACER machine is always attractive. If you have one, you will lose. It is worth buying such a machine at this price. The keyboard is good, the hand feels good, and the typing is very comfortable. 
0	"The hotel is relatively poor, I guess it has been upgraded from two stars to three stars. Poor hardware can be tolerated, and poor front desk service is unbearable. The front desk service is very poor. A waitress named Zhang Hongmei has an extremely bad attitude. I have verbally complained to the lobby manager. I hope that the brothers and sisters who go next time will not meet such a person. Additional comments on December 2, 2007: The hotel is relatively poor, I guess it has been upgraded from two stars to three stars. Poor hardware can be tolerated, and poor front desk service is unbearable. The front desk service is very poor. A waitress named Zhang Hongmei has an extremely bad attitude. Even if I meet someone on the street, his attitude is better than her. I arrived at the front desk at night, and after waiting for a long time (she has been working on the computer, I don’t know what I’m doing), then impatiently told me what you are doing? ! ! ! ! ! I had to be very careful about accommodation. Then I was very impatient to help me go through the formalities. When I checked out, I ran into such a god. You can't imagine the bad attitude. It seems that I hate her. I have verbally complained to the lobby manager. I hope that the brothers and sisters who go next time will not meet such a person. At the same time, I hope the hotel can give me a reply. CHUNLING219@SOHU. COM Hotel Feedback December 10, 2007: Regarding the situation you reported, the guest room leader attached great importance to it, and immediately held a special meeting for the staff and all managers of the main station, and conducted critical education and retraining of the employees involved. Ensure to improve service quality in the future work, establish a ""customer first"" service awareness, and strive to do a good job in customer service. We sincerely apologize to you again and look forward to your staying at Zhenjiang Hotel again. "
0	When I just turned on, the computer fan was running directly, and the hot air from the outlet kept blowing, which was shocked, but it was fine after installing XP. No XP driver~~ I suggest ASUS to add it quickly 
1	Although there are cases of lesson plans, I don't feel that it is suitable for my education mode! Our experimental conditions are not so high, whether students or teachers don’t pay enough attention to biology. I have watched enough videos of classes in good classrooms. The students in their schools in Beijing attach great importance to the study of biology and prepare sufficient experimental data and discussions, which can play a very good teaching effect. However, this book is helpful to teachers who value junior high school biology teaching! 
0	If it weren't for reading Zhang Ailing's book more familiarly, I wouldn't open this man's book. If it weren't for understanding Zhang Ailing more comfortably, I would not look at this man's opinion of Zhang Ailing. So, I bought it only for others 
1	"I have read the book ""Living"" and I feel deeply about the fragility of life and the impermanence of life. Although the protagonist Fugui has gone through hardships, he never bowed to fate, never complained about life, and continued to live with a tenacious attitude. This spirit is worth learning from each of us. As the book says: ""People live to live themselves, not to live for anything other than living."" Therefore, no matter how much disaster or pain we encounter, we should choose to be brave, persevering, and tenacious. Alive! Because it's good to be alive! "
1	The price/performance ratio is quite high, especially the 1999 special offer is very cost-effective. The performance is enough for general use, anyway, it is Internet access and a small amount of text processing, which is quite sufficient 
1	I bought a copy before and gave it to a friend. After I got it, I liked it very much, so I placed an order for another copy. The quality of the book is really good, but I don’t know if it was damaged due to a collision during transportation. Hope to strengthen the strength of packaging when shipping. 
1	1: The carpet is dirty, and the utensils such as the kettle and the toilet are aging 2: The service is very good 3: The geothermal mineral water is good 
0	Dangdang sent the wrong goods to me and refused to refund the shipping cost. I said that because the courier company has already delivered the goods, I admit that the courier company has already provided the service, but the fault is Dangdang. It should be Dangdang to bear the freight! It's unreasonable, it's just stealing money!!!!! 
0	To be honest, I waited until the book with full expectation and found that at most one-third of the content in it was about treatment methods, and the rest was just the author’s subjective metaphors and metaphors, plus a bit of reverie, which was very cumbersome, and obviously I was making up the number . sorrow. . . 
0	I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it, and it's useless to buy it. It's a bit interesting at first, but I don't feel that the connotation is deep after seeing it again. 
1	I stayed in the big bed room in February 2008, very satisfied. It was indeed a 5-star level, and the price was low. Will go next time I have a chance. 
0	Compared with M853, it lacks HDMI, camera, piano lacquer keyboard; hard disk is also small (160G). The price is only 300 yuan less than 853! Apart from the color, there is no reason to choose it. 
0	My baby is almost two years old. This set of books is too simple and unattractive for her. I bought it after reading everyone's reviews, which is not ideal. 
1	High performance-price ratio. Except for the integrated graphics, the others are very good. Those who don't play games are absolutely fine. I feel that only XP can be used to make the best use of it. The installation process will take a bit of hard work. After making a backup, it will be easier to handle. 
1	Overall I feel pretty good, I will stay here next time, I forgot it was the hot pot on the floor, I recommend it 
0	It's a big book with few content and few words. For younger children, the format is too big and hard. Older children see too little content 
1	"When I first got it, my chin was about to fall: Where is this book? It is clearly a booklet. The author is not kind. But after reading the content, I think that the price is still very cheap. If it is from the perspective of consumption, if you just buy it as a novel, you will regret it, and I advise you to buy another book. If you want to learn the skills of ultra-short-term trading from an investment perspective, then this booklet is definitely worth it. It is equivalent to buying the martial arts secret ""Tathagata Palm"" for fifty cents, without flicker, it is the real ""Tathagata Palm"". "
1	Good location, in the heart of Xujiahui, Shanghai, average price-performance ratio, large room 
0	The decoration of the hotel is rather old. The bathroom in my room has very little water and it is very inconvenient to take a bath. 
1	When I first read this novel, I looked forward to seeing it very much. When I was reading it, it didn’t attract my attention at first, but I gradually realized the sorrow and grief after reading the content, especially in the last tenth chapter. I shed tears while reading. I was really sad. I don’t know how the author felt when writing. If it were, I would give up writing because it was too sad. After reading it, I suddenly thought that I was too sad without reading the sadness sketches, but this indirectly shows the strength of Shui Yueying's writing. Come on and support you! 
0	"Although the content of this book is not much, the illustrations are very large, vivid and vivid. The stories in it are things that children have encountered and are very enlightening. My daughter liked it after reading it and encountered it during surgery. For similar things, she would say ""David, no"", hehe, it seems that it was affected by subtle influences. In general, I personally feel that this book is good, no wonder it is a book that has won an award. "
0	"This is a perfect book! Seeing Lala seems to see myself. I am also a sales assistant and administrative director. So when I read this book, I regard Lala as myself. The inner feelings of the characters are surprisingly similar to me, so I am more Can appreciate the feelings of the protagonist Lala and understand Lala's actions. I was lost too, it was Lara that gave me the motivation to move forward! As a newcomer to society, I always act emotionally and do things too straightforwardly. I have to constantly learn social experience and know how to deal with others so that I can continue to improve. Many principles in the book are very practical, and sometimes I will deliberately ask myself how to do it. Sometimes I complain because I seem to be the busiest in the company, but my salary is still the lowest. Lara is my role model, and my industry role model, I want to improve, as long as I work hard, I will definitely improve! ""Du Lala's Promotion"" is a good book worth reading! "
1	The price is moderate and the overall feeling is okay. The location is a bit difficult to find (because it is not on the side of the road), but it is very close to the commercial street Beijing Road, and there is a snack street outside the hotel. 
0	CF card and wireless network card (not USB) cannot be plugged into the computer for use; VISTA system is uncomfortable, and I want to modify WINXP; 
0	The memory of ddr3 is really a waste, and upgrading the memory is also very expensive. The driver is included in the CD, so you have to find the corresponding one by yourself. If you find the wrong one, it will cause a blue screen. 
1	"What kind of physique is my body? How to maintain my health? Reading this book helped me find my direction. In the past, my eating habits were unreasonable, with more meat and less fruits and vegetables, and I got constipation for a long time, which was very painful. I have read a lot of books about health preservation, but they are not sufficiently targeted. ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Physique and Health"" pays attention to individual differences. According to the recommendations in the book, I took a single taste of Chinese patent medicine, and the effect was very fast, and it did not produce the side effects of taking the medicine. I have only found this one because of a thorough analysis of the physique, and I highly recommend it. "
0	The optical drive is like an engine, the sound is very loud, the system is difficult to install, the XP cannot find the drive at all, and the heat is very large. 
1	"The lightness and thinness are absolutely satisfactory, and it seems that it can continue the quality of the old ibm from the workmanship. The heat dissipation is much better than expected. I thought that such a thin thing would definitely be hot when used continuously. The speed is also very good, that is, the reminder that vista asks you to confirm whether to ""continue"" is annoying. "
0	It may be because of the different national conditions, or it may be that the expectations of this book are too high, so after roughing through the content, it feels quite twisted and there are too many dogma! Strong theory! 
0	The style of Little Japan, the figures are small, it looks laborious, and the content is not nutritious. A book can be done in 1 hour! 
1	The big bed room is very good. The most recommended is the swimming pool and free long-distance calls. The disadvantage is that the lobby is too small and the taxi at the door. As long as it is to the airport, it will cost more. It is only 74 yuan from the airport, and 100 yuan to the airport. There is no time to discuss with him. . 
1	I bought it for others. After I got the book, I took a cursory look and thought it was pretty good. It really goes from the shallower to the deeper-the first part is a very basic dialogue exercise, then the cloze and reading comprehension exercises are designed, and the last part is reading common proverbs and idioms. The content is relatively simple, suitable for students who do not have a good foundation but want to improve their reading ability, or elementary self-study. If you can use this book seriously, it will help improve your reading ability. Suggestion: If only there is an improved version, let the students continue to improve their abilities after finishing this book. 
1	It took less than a week from getting the book to reading it last night. I have begun to use the methods described in the book to change my daily life. Although I know that I will have to practice for a long time to achieve that state of balance, but I feel that I am much more peaceful and active now than before. It made me understand that if you make yourself happy from the inside, no one can take away this feeling, no matter how things around you change. I will recommend this book to my dear friends and family. May we all live in love, joy and hope. Will. 
1	The appearance is stylish, beautiful, exquisite, and impeccable. The system comes with many new software. I like movie stories the most. You can edit videos and movie clips by yourself. There are many new features to be discovered~~ 
0	After waiting for 2 weeks, I finally got the notebook. The screen didn't light up when I turned it on. I ran back to the headquarters and returned the computer. I am still waiting for the test and said that I will wait 15 working days. Haha, is it easy to buy a computer? Is time wasted? Excuse me? 
1	Small size, easy to carry, low heat generation, battery standby time is longer than ordinary notebooks, but shorter than the advertising time, 4-5 hours is fine. 
1	Good value for money, I live in a business room in Donghui Building, breakfast is also good, the doorman is not very active, the deposit is the highest in the hotel I have stayed, the lobby manager is very good, now I don’t bring enough, and the password of the card is wrong , Resulting in insufficient deposit, the supervisor helped me sign a letter, comfortable 
1	The 4-year-old son is a dinosaur fan. When I bought the book, I saw the names of so many dinosaurs, and the content seemed very rich. But after I got the books, I realized that each one was not very thick. Although it is not told in the form of a story, but in the form of popular science, the son still likes it very much. After reading it for two months, basically, as long as you open the first page, you can point to the head of each dinosaur and name it. Even the distribution of dinosaur fossils on the earth, the age when the dinosaurs appeared, etc., are also very interesting. It can only be said that children have children's vision, and adults' vision may not be suitable for children. 
1	[Recommended book] Probably many middle school students, even college students, and adults will be full of curiosity about the world and universe we live in. Then this book is your good choice. Based on the basic knowledge of high school, explain profound theories in simple language, so that while satisfying your curiosity, you will not feel a sense of inferiority and irritability that you don’t understand. At the same time, it allows us to expand the scope of knowledge, so there is another topic in front of friends-so that you will not become an outsider when mentioning this type of issue. 
0	"I happily booked a room with Ctrip during my Qingming holiday. I wanted to have a luxurious self-driving tour. The room I was given was pitifully small. Compared with the environment of four-star and above hotels at home and abroad, the environment is not bad. It's ""bad""! When I checked in at the front desk, the staff told me that breakfast is free for children under 1.2 meters, so I made up for an adult’s breakfast. When I had breakfast the next day, the restaurant manager told me that children need to pay half the price, which is an external charge Full price! Finally, after some negotiations, the hotel lobby manager gave a discount of 20%, but it has left us with no fun! The hotel room environment is not worth the four-star level at all! The decoration is old, the rooms are small, but the location of the hotel is good, so can you set such a high price? Puzzled! Additional comments April 23, 2008: By the way, there is actually a charge for Internet access, which is the first one encountered in China! Incredible! "
0	"I bought Bi Shumin's ""Female Psychologist"" with great anticipation. I was full of expectations for this work before I read it, because I have read a lot of Bi Shumin's works. I really like the story after story she tells in plain, philosophical and concise language, especially the ""Women Worker"" that she read in 2008. I read it many times in a row and I like it very much. To be honest, I felt a little disappointed after reading ""Female Psychologist"". Although I am a science student, I like reading very much. He Dun, the protagonist of this work, is a humble but clever person who has certain pursuits due to his own background. With constant efforts, he obtained the qualification of a psychologist. In order to open a clinic, he married a man with a kind heart but no feelings at all. I don’t know, what does such a heroine bring to readers? At the same time, several stories in the work are far from daily life, and I feel that the author writes purely for writing and is worthless. Except for a few sentences that leave me with some impressions, the rest are forgotten after reading the book. Up. What a disappointment! "
0	The room was average, the water in the bathroom bathtub was a bit stuck. The standard room opened the window to the lobby restaurant. At 12 o'clock in the evening there seemed to be people eating and playing music, which was quite noisy. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good. It has just been renovated, so the facilities are decent. The room type I booked has a computer and the internet speed is good. It's just that the mat in the bathtub still has black marks, which makes people feel very bad. The breakfast is very rich, but it seems that the breakfasts in Chongqing hotels are very similar. Overall it feels good! 
1	In fact, the things used by big brands are not much different from those of small factories. What they buy is the quality control system and after-sales service, especially laptops. General Internet access and file processing. It is enough to see the photos. It is meaningless to blindly request high configuration. Replace it with a new one after two years. 
1	The price/performance ratio is good. In fact, I have been paying attention to Dell's XPS1330, but the price/performance ratio is not good and I have been hesitant to buy it. Fortunately, I didn't buy it. 
0	I stayed in room 241, which is quite quiet, and the sputum is very old, and there are a lot of hairs on it. The breakfast is very simple and poor. I think the level of more than 200 hotels is still good, even the taste of milk is very weak, except Oranges and small tomatoes, there is no fruit, and every morning we have to go to the reception desk to get a meal voucher, which is also very outrageous. Even if we are not annoying, we will increase the workload of the reception desk, and there will always be people checking out in the morning. Bottled water is a good thing, but the quality of that water is really bad. First of all, the bottle is black, and the degree of blackening of each bottle is different. When it is not opened, the hand is very soft. It is obviously made of recycled raw materials (illegal) (I am People who are engaged in plastic materials, so I dare to say that, the water also has a strange smell. This is too much. Although some previous evaluations say that the price is still suitable for this quality, then I want to say, if you look carefully, Beijing is far better than it. Low price, high quality hotel. 
1	A good BL text, without touching lingering, two cool men looking for warmth in the proximity of each other, but maintaining proper calculation and distance. Isn't human nature like that? I think there is nothing wrong with this. People should love themselves before they can love others. After all, love is nothing more than human affection. How can a person who doesn't even love himself love others? Jin Chen and Xiao Zhihao are also in the entertainment industry, which makes people less concerned about their homosexuality. Tolerance also requires an environment. 
0	"I saw the article ""Tears Are the Only Standard for Testing Literature"" on Southern Weekend. I have to admit that I was a petty bourgeoisie at the time and the author wrote sensational. Look at the topic. After I got the book, I flipped through it. The story is a common routine in novels, movies, and TV. The plot of life and death and blood doubts under the background of the Cultural Revolution is even simpler. The possible difference is that the tragic death is a male compatriot—— The third child. A series of celebrities who despise the recommendations on the back cover of this book. Fortunately, I then read a rather interesting workplace novel Du Lala's promotion note, which makes this life like life. "
1	AMD dual-core CPU, 250G hard drive, and camera, economical. USB distribution is also reasonable. You can install XP, not bad 
1	Recommended by a good friend, I originally gave an online link, but I am still more accustomed to the traditional reading mode. So I bought it and it was very touching, especially when I saw that Ruan Zhengdong was so good to Jiaqi, he knew her so well, and when he quietly helped her find her home, he was crying...Although the ending is not perfect, but Their attitude towards love, loving someone so wholeheartedly is the greatest interpretation of true love. Recently, many friends around me broke up inexplicably, which made me a little confused. After seeing it, I strengthened my confidence in love and decided to cherish the people around me. 
0	The book is not good, the price is expensive, and it feels cheated, especially the paper is too bad, my friends suspect that it is pirated. Check it out at the bookstore next time you shop online. 
0	It is the worst one of all the hotels I have stayed in. When booking, I said that I would like to have a non-smoking room, but after opening the door, I was upset by the smell of smoke and various body odors. The hotel may not have a non-smoking room at all , But Ctrip didn’t even mention that it was a negligence. The facilities are dilapidated and the towels are yellow. The bed sheets and duvet cover are old, I don’t know if there is any change. The service staff are all 
1	I thought that this set of books was a bit simpler for my daughter who just turned 6 years old, and I was afraid she would be less interested. Unexpectedly, she was loved by her daughter. After I read each book, she will read it carefully again (mainly looking at the pictures). And I played a role-play with me, calling myself jumping, and my mother was jumping. The picture of the book is simple, but there are many interesting and vivid details; the content of the story is simple, but it contains evocative philosophy and warmth. The age level that feels suitable should be wider. And the price is relatively high. 
0	The heat dissipation system was 3 hours worse than before. I went to JD.com and said that the inspection was delayed by 15 three guarantee days, and it was impossible to go to the AQSIQ. The display is also poor. Encountered a defective product, speechless. 
0	The reservation is recommended by Miss Ctrip. How do you say, one word, bad, two words, really bad, three words, really bad. The typical traces of a government-owned unit do not know what service is. The room is small and broken, and Samsung can barely. Spent more than 400 to buy a bottle of red wine, it's bad! 
1	Jingdong's delivery speed is really much faster than before. After paying more at 5 o'clock that night, the delivery will be confirmed an hour later, and the Shentong Express will be delivered the next day. ASUS notebooks are really good to use, with optical drives It only takes a few minutes to install XP. After the hard disk is partitioned, I installed WIN7 again. 
1	High performance-price ratio, good service, and late check-out is available if you have a room, which is very beneficial for tourists leaving Hong Kong by night flight. I just hope that the breakfast charge can be the same as CTRIP, the 80 yuan buffet is still attractive. In addition, it is too expensive to take the Guangzhou-Kowloon East Railway. It is recommended to take the subway to Admiralty. 
1	The configuration is better. . The graphics card is the selling point. . The NBA Collector's Edition is written on the box. . The memory is 2 1G. . Installing XP is very simple. . The official website has drivers available for download. . 
1	Overall it is ok, but it is not equipped with a system, it is inconvenient to install the XP system, and I changed several systems. Ha ha…… 
0	1. The screen size could have been larger, and the LCD size was much smaller than the size of the cover; 2. The built-in software has an EASY DISPLAY MANAGER. When the operation is prohibited, the functions such as Fn+ brightness adjustment and wireless network shutdown will be invalid. I hope this will give the new buyer a reminder 
1	My mother’s health is not very good, she also pays attention to health, she often watches TV about this aspect of content, but due to the habit of frugality, she never buys books, and I often don’t have around, in order to help my mother protect myself I bought her body and gave it to her, and the prices on the Internet were more pleasant. The books were all genuine books. My mother was very happy to receive them. When there were no related TV programs, she became her by reading these books. The main content of leisure life. Will buy more such books. 
0	Stayed on 9/11 because of a business trip, the hotel is too bad, the worst is the hotel environment, there is no shop or restaurant next to it, next to a non-operating railway station, the road is gray, donkey carts pass by from time to time It seems that the interior decoration was not opened in 2006. At least it has been in business for more than 10 years. The carpet is dirty. The bathroom does not have a separate shower room. Just pull the shower curtain. The bath water will spread to the entire bathroom and the towels are too old to use. The bath water on the first day was very cold, and the water temperature was not enough at about 30 degrees. The colleague’s room called crickets for two nights, and the breakfast included in the room rate was even worse. There were only about six or seven varieties in total. Rice, I can only drink porridge and soup, and the rest is cold (we didn’t get up late, it was breakfast at 7:30), I wanted to eat a small steamed bun, but it was so cold, my other The colleague took a plate around and put it back, it was too bad to eat. It can be said that the only thing that may be acceptable in this hotel is the service. 
1	The room is relatively spacious, and the lobby is far from the 5-star hotel. The elevator is fast, especially to the upper floors. 
0	The front desk service is very poor: I booked a viewing room. But when I checked in on the first day, the front desk staff insisted that I had booked a suite and had to call Ctrip to confirm, only then said I had booked a viewing room. When I checked out, I found that the front desk staff had privately changed the room rate that I confirmed at the time, changing the room rate from 558 to 588, which was confirmed at the time, and this process was never confirmed with me. What's more ridiculous is that the lady at the front desk did not even call me to confirm the bill, so she swiped my card. Doubt whether it is a black shop. Room service is extremely mixed: I originally wanted to sleep late, but I was woken up by the phone in my sleep at 9 o'clock in the morning and asked when I got up and asked to come and clean. I said I hadn't woken up yet, but I was asked if I could wake up in an hour? There is something wrong. Room: It is said to be the best hotel on the island, but the room is old and small. Not as good as a Samsung hotel. 
0	The sound is a bit bad, and the battery is indeed unused, and it is gone for more than an hour. The temperature of the cpu has been above 50 degrees, don’t know what’s going on

0	The screen size is smaller than Hp14 inches; the keyboard is easy to get dusty, it is recommended that Jingdong send the keyboard film; the camera refresh rate does not seem to be high, always flashing. I downloaded all the drivers from the official website, installed them all, and found that there are three unknown PCI devices. I am very depressed. Who can tell me what this is? 
1	The performance is good, the driver disk does not support xp, use the driver wizard and manually find the driver, installing xp, it is quite laborious, but the machine is very fast, the screen is also big, and it is great to play games. 
1	The performance is good, and the configuration is medium to upper, which is enough for most users. The appearance is low-key without losing the atmosphere, it is also good to buy it as a desktop at home. The screen is large, and it is also very comfortable for middle-aged and elderly people to surf the Internet at home. 
0	This book is not very useful to tell the truth, and what it says does not make me feel like I have learned anything. It's just that some of the wrong places in daily life can be found on the Internet. 
0	The book exchange requires the customer to mail it to Beijing. The postage is equivalent to the book fee. Is it necessary to exchange the book? Isn't it better to buy a new book? Your service like this is very disappointing. 
0	There are too few accessories. I bought a high-end version, which has one mainframe, one power supply, and a bigger one, no more. Without a mouse, an inner bag, not to mention outsourcing, don't even think about wiping, it should be equipped with a standard battery. 
1	Beautiful, good quality, and discrete graphics card, very good for students. It is really suitable for my sister who is going to school, if there is a red one, even better. If you don't need a separate display, the one with the same mold set display is more valuable. 
1	"In a complex society, it is inevitable to encounter various situations. Only by fully understanding yourself can you be comfortable with it. After reading this book ""Meeting the Unknown Self"", I benefited a lot and discovered more ways to make myself happy and grow. I understand that many of the unhappiness in life are actually caused by myself. I also introduced this book to my confidant, who also felt very enlightened. We also found more resonance between each other. "
1	I finished reading a brief letter to Garcia in my leisure time. This book uses a historical story as the background, and it introduces simple truths about people, beings, and doing things. Although the truths are easy to understand, not everyone can understand and use them. There are only a few successful people who can truly understand the law of success. The talents are wise. This book guides the direction and provides a shortcut to the soul for those who wish to take and prepare to take the road to success. The thin booklet is simple to read but not easy to do. It is a good book for people who are in politics or business. 
0	The breakfast was very poor and the check-in service was poor. I booked a non-smoking big bed, but when I entered the room, I found that it was a room with 2 beds. I asked them to change it. It was a big bed, but it was a smoking room. Up. Later, it was discovered that there was a big depression on the bottom of the mattress, which was definitely inferior. 
0	Yu Dan’s experience, I have watched it on TV and on the Internet. I remember that the teacher showed it to us when I was in college. Now I read a book, so I bought one, and I read it and it feels good, as well as bookmarks. The printing is in color and very good. 
0	The 14-inch wide screen is a bit smaller, and the usage rate is lower than the previous 4:3 screen, but the resolution is improved, which can be compensated, but the characters appear to be a little bit down 
1	High performance-price ratio, I found a lot of shopping malls but did not find a suitable one. The same thing is expensive in other places.

0	1. Room service attitude is good 2. Breakfast is not bad. 3. It is the room lighting, too unsatisfied~~ 
0	Especially with regard to the relationship between her and Comrade Director, Qiong Yao's little shadow has been inseparable, so wishful thinking I feel very good 
0	Dangdang’s delivery was really slow. It took 8 days from the time the order was placed to the receipt. It was still courier, and I made at least 10 calls to the courier. It took a few days before I arrived in the city. First of all, it was raining. , I kept saying that no one tried to arrange it. I bought more than 20 books, and there is a set of 12 books, each for a few dollars, but I sent a wrong copy, and one copy was repeated and the other was not published. I called Dangdang and said that if I want to change it, I need to send the whole set to the post office. They will then help me exchange the goods, but I really don't want to be so troublesome, and have to wait another 10 days. This transaction exposed a lot of Dangdang problems. In short, this transaction is not pleasant. 
1	The book is very beautiful and has the characteristics of a child. It is not blindly telling the story, but there is a pause, which can leave a lot of time for the child to think. 
0	"Let me talk about the hardware facilities first. I live in a 480 yuan economy suite, and I indicated that I would like a non-smoking room when booking. When I checked into room 1109, I realized what a suite is. The room was very dark and small, the furniture was old, and the carpet was dirty. Especially the smell of smoke in the room was very pungent and unbearable. I immediately asked the front desk to help me change the room. But the service staff said to check in the room first, okay, I'll wait. The waiter came and stood at the door and said, ""There is a smell, but I think it is the smell of wood."" Hehe, you can smell a strange smell without entering the house, you can imagine how big it is! It is neither newly decorated nor special wood materials. Where does the wood taste come from? I insist on changing rooms. So I switched to the same room type 409, no smell, OK. The waiter took me to look at the room, and after helping me put my luggage, I went out. The waiter closed the door for me. When I came back at night, I found the door couldn't be opened! The card was right, the lock was opened, but the door just couldn't be opened, so helplessly, he kicked it and finally opened. After entering the door, I was worried again, and the door could not be closed! After reading it carefully, I realized that it was too tight with the door frame, so I kicked it up again. It took a lot of effort the next morning to open the door. The bathroom is also very old, the towels are very old and gray. When the cold water faucet of the washbasin is turned on, it will make a loud engine-like noise, and it will turn off immediately. Talking about the service, I stayed alone, but gave 2 breakfast coupons. Breakfast ends at 10 o'clock, but at 9 o'clock there are many kinds of them. There are also very few varieties. On the dining table are a pair of chopsticks and a spoon. There is no knife and fork, which is very inconvenient. By the way, I returned the remaining meal coupon to the front desk when I checked out. The lobby manager came to ask about the check-in situation, and I said that it was enough to give the meal coupon according to the number of guests. The lobby manager was very aggrieved and said, ""You live in a double room, and we both give 2 coupons. This is our service."" I couldn't respond at once, but after contacting the inexplicable paid adult program in the room, it suddenly became clear. It's a pity that I'm here on business, not for entertainment. Additional comments August 3, 2008: I can only say that the enthusiasm of the service staff can score high, but the level of service is very average, and the room facilities are really poor. There is no small refrigerator in the room. What is provided is not bottled water, but a big bottle of water, so I don't dare to drink it. I made up my mind to book this hotel after reading your reviews, but I was so disappointed that I doubted how these high scores came out. Hotel Feedback August 13, 2008: Dear Sir: (please allow us to call you this way, because your name at check-in is inconsistent with the guest feedback name). Thank you very much for your message and valuable comments to the hotel. Regarding the various hardware problems you have pointed out about the hotel, the hotel has plans to renovate the guest rooms and related facilities at the end of the year; at the same time, the hotel services and other issues have attracted great attention from the hotel’s top management This matter will be thoroughly investigated, and relevant employees will be dealt with accordingly. At the same time, the hotel will conduct various trainings for employees to strengthen service awareness and improve service quality; I hope that I will have the opportunity to provide you with better services next time. We have stored your information in the guest history data, and we will provide personalized service next time you check in. Finally, thank you again for your various suggestions to this hotel so that we can better serve our guests and improve the overall quality of service. "
0	I'm all speaking objectively, and you can refer to it yourself. 1. The hotel phone cannot make external calls. Why doesn't Ctrip explain? 2. Slippers are not disposable. 3. Buying small things can not be included in the room fee and must be paid separately. 4. The socket in the room I lived in unexpectedly fell outside, is it too unsafe? 5. The most critical service attitude is the attitude of the guest house. 6. You cannot check out if you are not satisfied. Supplementary comments on January 22, 2008: 7. Breakfast is available at 7:30, a bit late. Hotel feedback August 16, 2008: Thank you for your evaluation, we have reflected the meaning and suggestions to the superiors and improved Service, I hope you will truly appreciate our progress next time you stay. 
0	I opened the package and found that the battery was already installed on the machine, and there was no CD-ROM installed. Is this all the case? The battery of the ASUS notebook I bought last month is not on the machine. 
0	Very bad hotel, I don’t understand why some reviews say it is good, 1. The hotel is very old, the room smells very musty, I complained to the front desk, the front desk actually said that every room is like this, when it comes to fire, the room is adjusted, but it is just the situation It’s a little better, but it still smells of musty 2. The room facilities are not good, the air conditioner blows to midnight, and suddenly it loses its function, it is not cold at all, it is stuffy all night, and people can’t sleep well 3. The lower floor of the hotel is an office building , The elevator is shared, the speed is very slow, it is a waste of time 4. The security of the parking lot is very poor, and I don’t want to open the fence on rainy days, so that the car can approach the door of the hotel, until we open the door to curse, the service is very poor July 3, 2015: Dear guest: Hello! We apologize for your unpleasant experience at the hotel, and please accept the most sincere apology from the hotel. Thank you for your valuable comments. The hotel leaders attach great importance to this. A special meeting has been held to find problems and implement improvements. We will continue to improve in management and improve the quality of service to ensure that every guest can feel at home. Thank you for your support to the hotel and sincerely look forward to your visit again! 
0	JD.com is strongly requested to change logistics, and the postal EMS express delivery is too slow. It took five working days to get it. One word, slow. If the machine is turned on, no problem is found for the time being, but the system is too difficult to make, hope to improve 
0	There are too few USB ports, only two, and they are all in the lower right corner of the fuselage, and an external USB mouse will feel very in the way-of course, just switch to a Bluetooth mouse. 
1	After reading this book, I have a feeling. Western booksellers sell services, and Chinese publishers sell commodities. You can download the scale of this book directly from the Internet, and it can be used in actual combat right away. However, we Chinese books have to omit part of the content in the book, so you can't learn it with your brains. We always say that it is in line with the world and the book price is about the same, but the service is still far behind. Now it is probably in line with Africa. Although this book is written by foreigners, we can also use it. Just pay attention to the differences in cultural background.

0	When can I receive it, it really doesn't work, I will return it and order it again, and it will be delivered to my door. I send someone's birthday book, the birthday is over, and the book has not come yet. 
0	I ordered it for a friend, and the feedback is not good! So I won't book this hotel next time! 
1	There are no advantages, the price is high, and the quality is not good. If you need a negative case, you can use it as a sample. 
0	"I bought this book for Bi Shumin's fame and for the slightly mysterious and mysterious words ""woman"" and ""psychologist"". What happened? First of all, the writing style is still very good, which is praiseworthy. But there is no innovation in the technique, and there is nothing new in applying the fashionable mode of writing in recent years! The most disgusting thing is that in the introduction, the words of the patients were written vaguely, and the titles on the catalog that were not directly related to the subject of each chapter. Grandstand! In terms of characters, the personalities are not prominent. Especially the highest authority in the psychology field, how powerful it has a background, but there is no personality in the dialogue, and it is not necessarily so advanced. It is simply a layman. Women’s psychological life experience is too vulgar, and even the big S’s serial dramas have similar plots. There are also gaps in her personality development, especially from nursing homes to going to psychology, the transition is far-fetched. The other characters have no impression after reading. Everyone feels it is not worth wasting time! "
0	I ran through it roughly, and my colleagues also borrowed it to read it. Our feeling is that this book is rather messy and difficult to read. And the description inside is relatively rough, not very practical, and meaningless. 
1	I only stayed once because I saw the needs of the client, because I used to live with 5 stars and were very new, so I didn't feel so good this time. Many aspects still need improvement 
0	Looking at this book with longing, and seeing the end, it was not as shocking as expected, so tearful. The author’s writing style is very poor, very basic, and the narration makes people unable to resonate with emotions. I suggest that he learn more from those famous works and write about the Cultural Revolution. Please see how Yu Hua wrote about love. Please see how Aunt Qiongyao describes In addition, I feel that the purest love in this history is too much of a name. Amy, do you think that simply describing the male and female protagonists without having a relationship is pure? ? ? ? It seems that your understanding of love is still too shallow 
0	With Bluetooth, the camera is perfect. But the price goes up. I just bought it and dropped another 200 yuan a week, which was unhappy. 
0	I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it, and it's useless to buy it. It's a bit interesting at first, but I don't feel that the connotation is deep after seeing it again. 
1	The battery is strong, which can meet the Internet and office use, the keyboard is relatively large, it is still very easy to use after switching to XP 
1	The price is high, the quality is not bad, and there is no difficulty when installing the system, just drive to the pipe network to find it, and it will be done in 1 hour~ Haha~ The cooler base sent is not easy to connect~ 
0	My baby boy is four years old. Children don't like this series of books very much. It may be because of the cultural differences between the East and the West. As an adult, I feel a little unacceptable in the story. Like a chicken with teeth 
1	The order placed on the 26th, due to waiting for Rapoo’s mouse, it was delivered to the 30th, but unexpectedly there was a price reduction on the same day, and the price guarantee was 44 yuan cheaper, which is considered an extra gain. The XP system is not very useful, it is wireless The network card is unstable, and the driver reinstallation seems to be no problem. It is advertised as an n network card. Unfortunately, the home router is 54 and the speed of 108 has not been verified. There is no major problem with OSX with WIND, and it has been upgraded to 10.5.7. The headset problem has not been resolved. The battery is 5200mA, and it seems that it will not last for 5 hours. 
0	Generally speaking, the impression of Dengfeng is relatively poor, which is basically a typical of dirty, messy and poor! The hotel’s facilities are extremely rudimentary, there is no shower curtain in the bathroom, and a shower is full of water! Moreover, there is no place to hang clothes. The restaurant in the hotel was already blacked out before 7 o'clock. In short, a rather dark and old hotel, and the condition is very average. However, the location is good, opposite is a supermarket, and there is a snack street. 
1	The location of the hotel is good, and the quality of the rooms is also very good, but the parking space is a bit less, parking is a bit tight. But it is understandable because it is in the center of Nanjing. 
0	Very doubtful about the evaluation criteria of five-star hotels. Samsung is inferior, very disappointed! 
1	"With the help of Mr. Ma Weidu, who said that his collection is well-known in CCTV's ""Hundred Schools Forum"", he selected a few small articles from his blog, coupled with some collections introduction, and then came up with this set of ""Ma Weidu Talks"". The small book is beautifully printed, so people can't put it down when holding it. Articles are based on blogs, mostly for the perception of life and the recollection of the past. From this, we saw a more three-dimensional and vivid collection of people. Ma Weidu's concern is not only about collection and culture, but also about the country's concerns and expectations for society. This life experience for most of my life may be more valuable than the full-bodied collection experience. "
1	I don’t know what’s going on recently, and a lot of books on the harem have been published, which makes me depressed. I've been paying attention to Daxin's book for a long time, and I ordered it immediately when it was on the shelves. Fortunately, it was delivered the next day. As a result, I saw that at 4 in the morning, I had to squint for several hours in order to go to work with my eyes open. In a word, it's so good-looking, how can it be so good-looking! I have also been watching Daxin’s NP ending, this time it may be for publication, but I still feel a little regretful. After reading Daxin's lust, I feel that it is unparalleled and beautiful, I really hope it can be published! 
1	I saw a lot of comments again, please, don't be arrogant, and calm down to criticize. 
0	I think many books are better than this one. I bought it after seeing the ranking of the rankings. It has no content at all. The story is too nonsense and I don’t like it. 
0	The hotel equipment is outdated, the service is poor, not as good as the two-star standard. What is even more depressing is that I got off the train at 7:30 in the morning and arrived at the hotel, but was told to check in until nine o'clock, otherwise I would have to add half a day's rent. As a result, in order to avoid freezing, an extra 250 yuan was paid. As a result, Ctrip is not my score. Really wronged. 
1	High performance-price ratio, good performance, xp is easy to install, use a U disk version of winpe to get everything, without the command line to rebuild mbr... 
1	There is no breakfast, the hotel price is relatively expensive, and the room equipment is relatively outdated. But a swimming pool is not bad! The Japanese and Brazilian barbecue buffet on the second floor is not bad! 
1	The look is beautiful, the keyboard is very handsome, and the hand feels good. I have used it for a few days, except for the shortcut key on the top, it doesn’t respond. The delivery is fast 
1	It is very convenient to travel, very close to the subway, there is a bar street behind the hotel, the room is not as small as expected, the quilt is super soft and very comfortable! I will stay here in the future! 
1	well. Very clean. It is newly decorated. The service is good. Breakfast is also very good. By the way, the quilt is thick but very soft. Haha satisfied 
1	Obviously the credit card is guaranteed. I ran to live and said there was no room. I had to upgrade. Finally, the hotel did not charge the upgrade money. But it was still very unpleasant. But the hotel is good. Marriott's management is good. 
1	Nice hotel, breakfast is good, rooms are more comfortable, and a satisfactory booking. Hotel feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support to this hotel! We will continue to maintain the 5-star dining and service standards, welcome you to stay again, and sincerely wish you good health and smooth work! 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, the keyboard is very beautiful, DDR3 sliver, Bluetooth, WIFI all have, perfect screen. . 
1	I only read this book when I grew up. I like the author's seemingly nonsensical but intelligent Pippi. Reading that Pippi's friends Dumi and Anika were heartbreaking when Pippi left to sail, they couldn't help but shed tears. Then, when Pippi couldn't bear being so sad for her, and decided to stay with her friends, I think I was as excited as Dummy and Anika. The most comforting thing is of course that Pippi always has endless gold coins and endless strength. Lindgren has this ability to make you laugh and cry, and you have to admit that you are still like a child. 
0	The workmanship of the back part of the battery is not very good, it is a little loose and the gap is a little bit too loose if you don't take a closer look. In addition, the white leather liner bag I sent feels a little bigger, and the surface leather is good. Among them are two thin sponge boards, which look like cottages. The battery is a bit protruding, of course, referring to the bottom. 
1	The price is very high and the appearance is also very beautiful. After the BIOS was changed to IDE, XP was installed quickly, not bad. 
1	1. The appearance is very cool and commercial. I like this simple feeling. 2. The keyboard feels good. 3. Good heat dissipation, the wrist is not very hot, and the fan has not been turned. 
0	The room was very old and poor. Later I changed the hotel and it was less than 3 stars. Hotel Feedback July 22, 2008: Please suggest specific aspects! We will try our best to improve and correct! Thank you! 
1	The best hotel I stayed in Shanghai for a few days, both are four-star, the overall feeling is the most high-quality, the reservation desk gave the 2715 corner room, very comfortable, my son was very happy, but the hotel The attitude of the service staff is relatively indifferent, and there is still a difference between the treatment of domestic and foreign guests. The same stopped the taxi, and the doorman actually said to me, please let our guest. I look back and see that it is a pair of foreigners living in this hotel. Not a guest? I let it out of courtesy, but I feel very uncomfortable. I hope that Ctrip's price can be lower. 
0	There have been many comments on the benefits of this book, but when I showed my son, the three-year-old reacted beyond my expectations. From the beginning, he didn’t want to touch it. When I went to bed at night, he also appointed me to take it away. He said, Mom, I don't like that child. Look at his teeth, he seems to bite!---I really didn't think it would be like this! 
0	This hotel is the worst one of the domestic four-star hotels I have stayed in. The service attitude and quality are very poor. The rooms are very small. Breakfast is not even meat. It ends at 9:00 and arrives at 8:00. Basically There is nothing to eat, and the waiter will not add it! Maybe it's because of tourist attractions, but we have stayed in other three-star hotels nearby. They are better than this one in all aspects, and the price can be more than 100 cheaper. It is recommended not to stay! There is a public security bureau working in the hotel, so most of them are clients of the public security bureau, so the service to ordinary people is very poor, the wall sound insulation design is very poor, so it appears very noisy very early, and there is no way to rest! 
1	"Mr. Zhang Jingsheng’s concept of love is the first among the founders of the country, and it’s really exciting to travel freely in the sea of love! Mr. Zhang’s love concept is based on women’s independence and gender equality. How cute are those women in Mr. Zhang’s life who are independent, free and brave to pursue love! Although this book was written half a century ago, the concepts in it are still avant-garde in China today, giving people a lot of thinking and enlightenment. The beautiful language in the book speaks like gurgling water, giving people a beautiful enjoyment. What a ""beautiful talk""! "
0	It would be great if the camera position was available, but the abrasive tool was opened but not installed, which was very disappointing. I would rather more than 50-80 can be used as an option. 
0	I feel that there is a gap on the side of the screen. The system partition is too unreasonable. Why is there not even a backup copy? 
0	I saw that everyone said it was very good before, so I was very excited and I bought the book and looked at it very generally. It talks a lot to let us admit that we are a layman. Talk a lot just to say the importance of money. Isn’t the people now vulgar enough? Not enough Worshiping money? I don’t need her to say that I know the importance of money. I guess everyone knows the article about having a princess’s hand, although it sounds reasonable, but if everyone takes care of their hands well If no one does things, then those things that are left to do are not in line with our actual situation. It is impossible for everyone to ask a nanny at home! There are also more than 200 pages in the whole book, but in fact the fields are very large and the pages are left. There is not much content at all, and it’s not worth buying. 
1	The price-performance ratio is better. I have upgraded to 4G memory, installed a communication disk, and installed Ramdisk, which is very good and powerful. The keyboard feels good. 
1	The staff is good, the location is excellent, and the breakfast is good. However, the internal facilities of the hotel rooms are relatively outdated and the house area is also small. Compared with the newly-built economy hotels, it has little advantage and does not reflect the four-star standard. Currently, the surrounding area is undergoing demolition and construction, and there is construction at night downstairs. Fortunately, I did not hear the construction sound inside the house. Generally speaking, the price/performance ratio is average. 
0	After reading it, I don’t know what the author wants to say, but I want to know the specific method and the result is nothing, and it cannot solve the actual problem. 
0	I placed an order, but this book was not delivered to me, but other books were delivered, which is really strange. Didn't say why 
1	The room is not too small, the bed is good, although not too soft, it is comfortable and clean. The biggest problem is that the Internet is too expensive, HKD70/HOUR, like a money grab, why don’t hotels in Hong Kong have free Internet access? 
1	Keep watching and start to learn to perceive, now life and relationships are very good 
0	"The hotel facilities have been in use for at least ten years, and they are not well maintained. Upon entering the room, a musty smell came out, and the carpet was stained; the wooden wardrobe in the corridor, the door could not be properly closed and opened The door of the cabinet has a more musty smell, and there is a small door on the top of the wardrobe that cannot be closed. After opening it, it is found that there are pipes, spider webs, and thick dust inside. The empty space between the bed and the console still has empty beverage bottles left by the guests who stayed last time, and there are still a few hairs on the towels in the bathroom... I really can’t believe this is the ""netizen evaluation"" in the eyes of the telephone booker Higher"", ""Samsung Hotel"". In the future, if I encounter inconvenient Internet access and rush to book a hotel, I will never make a risky move to book a room by phone! "
1	Jingdong came to pick up, the service and distribution speed is not bad, the original unopened, the machine is satisfactory, the cost performance is very good, and the appearance is satisfactory. 
1	"Seeing a paragraph of pseudo-random numbers today, it suddenly became clear. There has always been a question, how can the random number generated by the computer be random? It must be certain. No wonder it is called a ""pseudo"" random number. Today, we know that the ""pseudo"" random number should be rehabilitated. To be precise, it should be called a one-way random number. Gained insight! "
0	I used to feel very good about Hechun, and I was disappointed after I checked in in person... The room was very old, everything was old and looked a little dirty, and there was some smell. The price for Ctrip was too expensive, not worth it! In the future, consider the two newly opened Galaxy Holidays, as well as Parkway or New International Holiday Hotel. 
0	"It's too naive. The whole book has nothing but the words ""David, you can't"". No help for children and parents at all. waste money. "
1	The location of the hotel is good, the facilities are relatively complete; the price is higher, parking is not convenient and the charge is high. 
1	It looks good and has no highlights. The numeric keyboard is very convenient for people like me who eat by numbers 
0	This book is entirely based on a commercial book published after the movie became popular. The content is very incomplete. Many of Zhang's novels are collected in it, but they are all simplified. 
1	When I arrived in Hong Kong on the 22nd, I thought that the hotel address was better, but I was disappointed. When booking with Ctrip, I said not to have a low floor or a double room, but when I arrived at the front desk, I was told that I had not received these requests. It is easy to change to a big bed room on the 3rd floor. The window looks like a platform, which is very depressing. The bathroom has a strange smell. The TV is small and broken. The service is not very good. Anyway I feel cheated. . . . 
0	I think the touchpad is a tasteless, in fact, the pressure cap is perfect. The touchscreen is very useless, and it is not easy to use. 
1	The room facilities are outdated, the sofa is probably from the 50s, and the bathroom is very small. There are many types of breakfast, good revolving restaurant and convenient transportation. 
1	I bought this book for my colleague, and when the book arrived, I also looked through it. The picture of the book is colorful, and some details are drawn in great detail, such as the beak of a kingfisher. According to colleagues, some small regrets are: as a parent-child reading, the text part is not interesting enough. For a three-year-old baby, there are more places to explain separately. Therefore, this set of books is suitable for older babies. Of course, if your baby is interested in plants and animals, and has a preliminary understanding of this information, then this set of books could not be better. I really appreciate the pictures in the book, delicate and vivid. 
0	Since there is a Thinkpad mouse, why not send one. Today, when I went to Guangzhou to pick up, I almost slapped one of the front desk MM. She pulled her face and spoke impatiently, as if everyone owed her money, her quality was really terrible! Seriously insulted Jingdong's image! 
0	The GL40 motherboard is a reduced configuration version of GM45~ With T4200 and DDR3 1066, it can't give full play to its proper performance~ Moreover, neither the network card nor the wireless network card uses the poorly compatible Atheros. So far, the wireless network card still does not work properly after XP is modified 
1	Beautiful appearance. . Exquisite workmanship. . The new packaging seal is unopened when it arrives. . The battery can be used for 5 or 6 hours. . Suitable for mm use. . The inner bag delivered is relatively thin in material. . 
0	I finally chose to try this hotel in the cold winter of 2008. I have always tried new things and I am willing to give them opportunities, but this time I was really fooled and it was not worth it. Several Achilles' heels of this apartment hotel are listed as follows: 1. The air conditioner is a mess. Low power and high noise. It’s on, no matter what it’s used for, and it’s too noisy for you to be at peace; when it’s off, you can see it when you breathe out in the room on the 27th floor. 2. Not every room has a washing machine. This is a bit false propaganda. 3. The hot and cold water heater is unstable due to water pressure. Not freezing to death is your luck. 4. There is no heating in the bathroom. If the hot water is not strong enough, you will definitely catch a cold. 5. The balcony is closed, and no entry is allowed. 6. The network crawls at the same speed as the tortoise. Generally speaking, this hotel is okay in seasons when air conditioning and hot water are not needed, but in other seasons. An apartment of 399 a night costs 12,000 a month. What kind of house can I rent in Shanghai at this price? ? ? It is recommended that the people who stay in consider carefully. 
0	This book may have been written in a foreign format. I personally feel that it is not attractive enough. It is not as interesting as domestic children's books and does not adapt to China's national conditions. 
1	Very good hotel, although it is not in the city center, but not far from the Bell Tower and Drum Tower, the starting price of a taxi is good, or you can take the 606 bus, the station is opposite the hotel. The hotel has a good environment, the rooms are clean, and the staff service is good. 
0	"In order to facilitate the transportation, the mayor's building was chosen. I thought the Mayor Building was a relatively new hotel, but I felt disappointed as soon as I walked in—the lobby is super small (it should be said that there is no lobby, the building looks good in appearance but terrible inside). The carpet in the room is also very old. What is even more annoying is that when I booked online on Ctrip, I saw that the Superior Suite had breakfast for two. But when I checked in, because I was the only one, the front desk only gave me a breakfast voucher. I questioned, and the front desk replied that ""you must register two people's certificates to give two breakfast coupons."" I said that I have stayed in many hotels in China and I have never heard of such unreasonable requests. And Ctrip's booking instructions did not indicate such a requirement. The lady at the front desk replied ""This is what our hotel stipulates"" (not even a word of sorry). It's disgusting! The impression is too bad, I will not consider staying at this hotel next time! "
1	It took me more than 2 weeks, and the biggest thing I felt was the long time. Commonly used software is ok. As for the best games, desktop computers are better. Don't expect it to help you. 
1	"After reading Mr. Wu Si's ""Unspoken Rules"" and ""The Law of Blood Remuneration"", there is one more tool for understanding Chinese history. Some historical facts that were previously incomprehensible can be easily solved, and we can look back at the present. Benefited a lot. When I first got it, I found that it was different from the version of ""Unspoken Rules"" I bought before. The former is from Fudan University and the latter is from Chinese Publishing House. It is a pity to look at the different layouts in the bookcase. But after turning over it, I feel that the Chinese version is better than the one from Fudan University. The layout design and the illustrations in the book are more natural. Those who like Mr. Wu should not miss it. "
0	I didn't remember much words with it! If you want to learn vocabulary, there are many ways, there is no need to buy this to waste money, but I regret it! 
0	The hotel environment is not good, and the atmosphere is not good. Just when my wife and I checked in, the lady called to ask for special services. It was terrifying. My wife said nothing to live there. In the end, I reluctantly convinced my wife to live. One night, but later, it was even more horrible. There was no supply of boiling water. Then, I had to boil the water myself, but the kettle had already grown hairs. Later, a waiter reluctantly changed it. But it was still the case. Knowing what to say, the mineral water we bought in the end was barely dealt with 
0	It’s too troublesome to install XP. I read countless posts on the Internet and finally I downloaded a 1G GHOST file. I made a USB boot disk before installing it. But the driver installation is too troublesome, especially the sound card driver is super troublesome. The graphics card does not have an A card and has strong performance for playing games. I can barely make do with it 
0	A Canadian uses Chinese poor English as a demonstration to tell you what is correct English. Not to mention that you can't learn a few words and accurate expressions in this way, and the author's mocking attitude is also unacceptable: Yes, you are a native English speaker, so what? The price and content are not equal, not worth it. 
0	I live in this hotel because of the office renovation. What is the so-called 4-star hotel like this one depends on the relationship. I will tell you now, that one in Yibin is better than this one. The chickens here keep crowing at night. And it does not distinguish between male and female. Will keep calling until 2 o'clock, I am on fire at night, the main station will tell the dick that the male room is staying, so you don't want to sleep well at night. They complained and said they didn't. 
1	Rui Chenggang just came to our school to give a speech, because the 19th National Book Fair was held in Jinan some time ago, he came to Shanda, and I read his talk on our school intranet, and I feel it is indeed a A relatively competent host, has been to many countries, met many big scenes and personalities, and has unique opinions on many hot issues. He is the youngest visiting scholar at Yale University. A blog post indirectly made Starbucks move out of the Forbidden City. It is indeed a role model for young people to learn, and I recommend this book. 
0	I just installed the system hard drive on the machine and it broke. I found a store to replace it. The processing speed is still quite satisfactory. 
0	When I was in the taxi, the driver began to ask me why I booked this hotel, saying that it was really not good. I thought it was the driver who wanted to take me to another hotel to make some soliciting money. Unexpectedly, this car went all the way. After driving, after passing the bustling area, I came to a remote corner, and what I saw was a hotel that looked like a guest house. My first impression: bad! ! Enter the hotel, look at its front desk, and describe it in Northeastern dialect: Knock! ! It's an authentic guest house, not to mention three stars, two stars are not even considered! ! ! What's more, the Internet said that there is free broadband. When I asked, not every room has it, and it just so happens that the room I want to book is not available. . . . Simply depressed. . The next day, I had to plug in a power strip. I brought a very small one and couldn’t use it. I asked the front desk to buy another one for me. I will pay for the money myself. People replied: I can’t buy it now. , It is possible to lose 100,000 tens of thousands at once! ! 
0	Personally, I feel that the heat dissipation is not very good. Some warm hands are not as good as my ASUS A8. In addition, the keyboard is a bit hard, the spacing is a bit low, and typing is a bit unaccustomed. There are not many additional software such as power management. 
1	I recommend this book to my friend~~ My friend glanced at the book cover and said: It is a book read by idealists~ I said, although it is ideal~ but it looks very comfortable~ Start understanding real life in heaven, because I I don’t know what happens now and what will become in the future~Because I believe that things in this world are connected together~You and me, me and them...past, present, future...I like this book very much Book~ Start to recognize everything happening around me again. Pay attention to everyone who passes by~ 
0	The invoice is very clear, the gift package, the phone customer service has processed it and there is no news. Jingdong online customer service even came to the 618 because of the 618 discount and there is no package. I think it is very unreasonable. Since there is no gift package, don’t write the gift package. The price is 400 high and there are a lot of gifts. Now I don’t do anything, and I have to buy the bag myself. 
1	After my friends borrowed the book from me, they asked me to order another set for them by mail, which shows that this book is really good! ! 
0	When I bought this book, I had not finished reading Zhang Ailing and the book about Zhang Ailing. Just because the reviews here seem to be pretty good. It is also because I am eager to learn about Zhang Ailing. After reading Zhang Ailing and her works about Zhang Ailing. I'm really not in the mood or interested in reading this rubbish book. Calm! Calm! Now that you have bought it, let's take a look, or look at it from another side. However, I just read a section and didn't want to read it anymore, so I left it in a corner and never wanted to touch it again. He is said to be a genius, but I think his writing is really clumsy. Talking, messy, vulgar, not knowing what to say! He piled up all the words in his pig's mind that he considered to be gorgeous, and it became a so-called gorgeous sentence. Overall evaluation: garbage 
1	European-style minimalist decoration, with bay windows, but it’s a pity that the surrounding area is full of buildings. The big bed is made up of 2 small beds. It can be seen that the small bed is very small, duvets and pillows. In the Happy Valley residential area, it is relatively quiet. The surrounding supermarkets, There are many laundries and average restaurants. It is not easy to take a taxi when you go out. There are free buses to Times Square and other places, and there are paid airport shuttle buses. 
0	I didn't want to say it at first, but Dangdang's service is really bad. This book shows that the library time is 2007-10-30 21:58:23, but today is November 12th, but I haven't received it yet. , The payment method I chose is express cash on delivery. After so long, the surface mail has arrived. Which express delivery is it? It takes 12 days. The most ironic thing is that I wrote a complaint letter, and the kf reply is to I continue to wait. The first letter I reply to is an email asking me to write some comments on this book. I am so angry, the book has not been received, what else is the comment???!!!! The service of Dangdang is really bad, After that, there is no sign. Other websites have called or sent an email to ask about it. Dangdang has nothing. Sending one in 12 days. In Dangdang, it may be normal, otherwise how can it be so long? Do you ignore the delivery time? 
1	I have stayed in all the five-star hotels in Nanjing, and I chose this one (the former Shangri-La). Whether it is hardware facilities or services, it is impeccable... If there is a disadvantage, the room rate is very expensive, hehe, but I hope Ctrip can talk about more favorable prices. 
1	Perfect screen, does not feel thick when opened, very light, the keyboard feels good, and the camera is clear! Toshiba DVD, Western Digital hard drive, 45nm processor is good, the temperature is always around 40 degrees, the battery used for 2.7 hours (only online), no one will play games on the notebook, this XP is enough! 
1	"I liked this book very much at the beginning, probably because I really liked the comic book ""Heaven is the Red River Bank"", so I have been looking forward to the ending, and now it finally ends. Love is really mysterious. Something, every girl will unconsciously fantasize when reading a book if the heroine in the book is me! Even if I am not young now, I have such thoughts from time to time. It is really strange. When I read every book, I feel that I am actually very young. I think many girls are There should be such an impression! "
1	Recalling the past will always make people quiet, thinking at the same time, but at the same time appearing so comfortable, thinking about how many years ago, recalling the scenes of how many years ago, suddenly feel that so many years have passed, indeed In this materialistic era, it is rare to find such quiet text. It is only a narrative, a lot of rash comments, a lot of expert tone, a lot of impetuous fame and fortune, and more of it brings some simple Happiness, simply let us not quarrel with others, no need to fight with others, it turns out that plainness is true! 
1	Dangdang's service is still in place. One page of the book I bought is broken. I returned it yesterday afternoon. Thank you Dangdang. 
0	To enter the BOIS that comes with it, set the installation disc to CD-ROM installation, pick the disc, this notebook is only suitable for DIY and those who have intermediate knowledge of computers. Researched for 3 hours before successfully pretending to be XP 
1	I said it was a fruit plate, but when I got to the room, I didn't have it at all. I called and asked several times. At first, I said it would be delivered immediately. Later, I said that it was delivered the next day after get off work. And the fruits were all whole and not cut. But overall it is worth the money. 
1	The price is reasonable, the configuration is balanced, and the processor, motherboard chip, and graphics card are all new generations. The appearance of side A is okay. In addition, it feels very light and thin (maybe because of black all day long), and it is easy to carry. With a drive disk, there is no need to go online to find time-consuming. 
1	The appearance is atmospheric and beautiful, the heat dissipation is good, and the noise is low, especially the small keyboard with it is very convenient and suitable for the cost personnel. Speed and performance feel good. The built-in VISTA system is quite good, and the mastering method is more fun to use than XP. 
1	I fell in love with Ming Xiaoxi's work again and returned to the dream world. Feels great. When I was in high school, I really liked Ming Xiaoxi's work. Especially the crystal clear series, it is super sensational. In the freshman year, there was a bubble summer in the dormitory. I thought my classmates didn't know, but the result was unexpected: everyone spoke very vigorously. It's not just talking about love. The characters inside can be reflected in their own lives. Love inside&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183; 
1	Although the facilities are a bit outdated, the good service is warm. The location and environment of the hotel are excellent. For older individual travelers, staying at this hotel is a better choice. 
1	Very old five-star. Objectively speaking, maybe once worthy of this title, but what you see now is really out of date. It is strongly recommended to renovate and replace with new facilities, but the service is still very good, when you know our After being dissatisfied, the manager took the initiative to upgrade our room...the service is good 
0	It is very old, very shabby, very poor, very expensive, and will not live anymore. The reservation requires a credit card guarantee, just for fear that others will change their minds after seeing the scene. No front desk, very poor 
0	The fingerprint collection function of the piano paint is a bit powerful. Haha, but it’s nothing. I think it’s completely negligible. I think it’s a hand-painted work. 
0	Since last year, I have stayed in this hotel in Guangzhou. At the beginning, I felt pretty good, the location was good, and the room was convenient. The disadvantage was that the bathroom was too small. Later it got worse and worse. This time in December, it was particularly uncomfortable: sleep at night, guests in the next room The sound of the water in the bath is very loud, the sound is like the decoration next door; the service attitude of the hotel restaurant is extremely poor, it may be that we took the breakfast coupons from the hotel, and the minister's face seemed to owe her money, and the most common order was I hadn't come in after waiting for half an hour, and finally left without food; the attitude at the front desk was not good, I didn't see a smile from start to finish, I definitely won't stay here next time. 
1	I received a call from my mother last Sunday, telling me that I have read the book. I have performed several operations according to the method in the book, and found that my blood sugar has improved significantly after the meal. After reading the book, the measurement was 6 o'clock after practice in the first week, and after practicing 4 times in the second week, the blood sugar after the meal dropped to 4 o'clock, which has become normal. Dad was also very happy, saying that this is the best blood glucose test for my mother after more than three years of meals! Hope this book can play a role in my mother's illness! I also hope that this book is the real gospel for people with diabetes! 
1	The hotel is not bad, the price is affordable, and the service is in place. I recommend it! 
1	Performance　 is good. I will partition it when I come back. I divided it into 5 areas. Enjoy it slowly. White and a green liner bag is cool to death. Overall it is good. The battery time is super long. I like it the most. 
0	The room is not cleaned (there is a dirty sock under the table), the equipment is relatively old, the breakfast is too bad, and there is no cold water when half of the bath is washed, and almost burned. Generally speaking, it is poor and will not choose again Check into this hotel 
1	The baby bought this set of books for one year and two months, and he likes it very much, because the content of the book is simple and easy to understand. The most important thing is that almost every page has a place for the baby to flip and fold, a small toilet lid, Colorful bubbles, rich refrigerator...to stimulate the baby's desire to explore, it is recommended! A reminder to pay attention, it is best for adults to hold the book to tell the baby, and at the same time guide and encourage the baby to flip through the active part of the book, do not let the baby read the book freely, otherwise the baby will easily tear off the active part of the book. 
0	The battery does not work. After 12 hours of continuous charging for 3 times, the battery can only last for 1 hour and 40 minutes. When the remaining battery power is 99%, it shows that there is 1 hour and 59 minutes of available power, and the actual use is 1 hour and 40 minutes. 
0	After reading it for one third, I couldn't stand it anymore. I bought a set. It's not worth it. One piece of advice for everyone: buy a copy first and check it out, and then buy the rest. 
0	Rubbish, quite rubbish, a lot of 1 and 2 are repetitive, not to mention, always buy off, what this detailed content depends on how many pages of the second book, that content depends on where the first book. There are countless such things. It feels like letting you buy his books in a disguised form, the method is quite cheap. And the words are too thin... 
0	It is more than 80 more expensive than Xino~~100 more expensive than yixun~~~ but I trust Jingdong~~~ and there are self-pickups in Tianjin~~It’s not good to be expensive~~ 
1	I bought two copies and prepared to give it to someone with a big nerves to stimulate her! 
0	The speed is average. And it should be suitable for young people, because the font is still relatively small. If you use it for your father, you can't see clearly. 
0	To be honest, this hotel is really not good. The 428 suite is actually just a big bed and a small bed, plus a table, no bathtub, hot water takes several minutes to come out, the most shabby breakfast, breakfast is two buns, A little noodles, a bowl of porridge, I really can’t figure out why the charge is so expensive? I will take photos of all breakfasts on file, if you want to, you can make a field trip! What a double breakfast, fooling people! 
0	There is a dead pixel on the screen, but it has little effect; the battery is indeed not disabled, which is more than an hour; the heat dissipation is okay, the lower right side of the keyboard is a bit hot. 
1	The hotel’s room types are relatively limited, but the business standard rooms are still good, and the facilities and services are still in place. However, the room I stayed in this time is the outermost room. The temperature of the room is relatively low, the heat preservation is poor, and the self-service breakfast and The lunch taste is okay and the price is moderate. What this hotel does not lack is that although the customer source is remote and there are fewer taxis, it is the most convenient to go to the development zone. 
0	The name of Dangdang does not match the truth, and the order will not be delivered for many days. Asking the customer service will only defer, and will only ask the user to place another order. Such service can't keep customers. It is better to go to other websites to buy books. 
0	I sent a cable to connect to the TV, but there is no interface in the notebook, I don't know why! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I chose YTO Express for delivery, but it was sent by Zhongtong Express. It took two trips from Beijing to Zhengzhou before delivery. It made my waiting anxious, and I was very excited to receive the books. 
0	This is the worst 4-star hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel was originally 3-star and has been renovated, but it is 3-star in its bones. The details of the bed, faucet, room furniture, carpet, etc. can be seen. The most hateful thing is that I had a drink with friends on the evening of July 12, and I returned to the hotel at more than 3 o’clock. I booked a ticket on Ctrip and asked to be delivered tomorrow morning. Before 10 o’clock in the morning, the Ctrip ticket agent went to the hotel to deliver the ticket. But the guard refused to give it, saying that the hotel only allows their security to send it away. Others refused to come and asked me to go down and pick up the ticket. I had a terrible headache and asked them to help me coordinate with myself. After a few phone calls, there was still no solve. In the end, I had to complain to their deputy manager: There are young ladies walking around in the hotel at 2-3 in the evening, and no one can take care of them everywhere. If they send tickets to the guests, your dog will take care of it. Later I learned that the dog at the door wanted to ask for a tip. When leaving, the attitude of the front desk staff was not good. At the door, the dog came and asked me to take a hotel car to the airport. From 150 to 80 yuan, I told him that I would sit for someone else, but I would not sit if you introduced me. . . 
0	The piano lacquer of the machine cover is really a flaw. What a sweat! ! ^_!!! There are too few gifts! 
1	1. Delivery is slow, order on 19th, payment on 20th, arrival on 28th 2. If the joint insurance policy is not filled out or stamped, the joint insurance policy sent is useless, 3. There is no Chinese manual, there are two papers with all the words, but no MSI logo was found. 4. There is not a phone that can be directly connected, there is a voice phone, 10 times. 10 times nowhere. Waste consumers' money 5. The battery is not original, I suspect it is parallel imports 
0	"For apartment-style hotels, the expectations are generally not too high, but it is enough. It is a pity that I was extremely disappointed after entering Nanyou. The room is big enough, but the decoration is old-fashioned and low-quality (I lived in a deluxe two-person suite), this hotel is not recommended! ! The most ridiculous thing is the kind of ""package"". I paid an extra 60 yuan to play a few rounds of bowling. When I checked in, I gave me those bowling coupons. The funny thing is that these ""coupons"" cannot be used on Friday, Six and daily use... Oh my god, Ctrip office didn't remind me. I paid 60 yuan for nothing. Although it is not much, the point is that my girlfriend and I are very angry. Should I go to Zhuhai for ""bowling"" on weekdays? I still keep those coupons. I want to see what Nanyou and Ctrip.com have to explain! ! ! Hotel Feedback September 7, 2007: I once again express my deep apologies to you. The hotel sports package includes breakfast coupons and golf coupons or bowling coupons, which can be used on weekdays and holidays. As a new employee was unfamiliar with the bowling alley incident on the day of the incident, he thought you were using other coupons that could not be used on weekends, which caused a misunderstanding. We also failed to understand your discomfort in time. Afterwards, we will review this case specifically to ensure No more similar incidents. To express our sincere apologies to the hotel. Your bowling ticket can be reissued at any time. The hotel provides you with a free luxurious suite for two, and promises to provide you with quality and considerate service. Hope you give us one "
0	The room is small and very old. I went down to the lobby to renew the room at 12 o'clock in the evening, and I saw a big mouse passing by. 
0	When booking, it was stated that you would like a room on the second floor, and it was on the first floor when you checked in. The Internet said that an additional breakfast was 10 yuan, and the actual charge was 15 yuan. Staying in a hotel also pays 10 yuan for parking. The carpet in the deluxe single room was soggy, I was speechless. But the hotel environment is good, unfortunately this environment 
0	To use it for the first time, there are too many things installed by default, you must optimize it yourself, otherwise it will be too stuck 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the configuration is balanced, the interface is rich, and the value is relatively good. The heat dissipation is good, not too hot. It has a camera and microphone for direct video chat; it has a card reader and is compatible with xD cards. 
0	The package of Beijing’s second time has been packaged, and the contents of the package are all gone, which is much worse than the package of the last time. The cleaning is straightforward. Good heart, good? The original is bad. Then there is the system? Is it slow? The other is what you think. Can you want to step back, I don't know some consumer demand. 
0	I booked the luxurious suite with river view on the 7th floor on the 22nd. After I checked in, I learned that the river view needs to open the door and go through the stairs to the public balcony to see the river view. The most damn thing is that the bedroom bed has only one glass window with the public passage Apart from it (with curtains), I can't see the river view, but the sound of people walking and passing by the corridor is very clear. Asked to change rooms at the front desk, the lady said no, but she had no choice but to check out. The lady said that there was one on the 6th floor, but it was a standard room on the 6th floor, and asked to check out again. The lady said that there was 1 on the 5th floor and went up to the 5th floor. , This time the Riverview Suite is really spacious and comfortable, and you can move in directly. When I took a bath, I found that the shower room was too small, and it was hard to turn around, and the water was hot and cold. What a broken hotel is this, four stars, not even two stars. 
1	"I read this book because of the title. I got up so well and expressed my heart. Fall in love, as if never hurt! The author of MAYBE is Aries, and I am both. When I read this book, I really seem to be the heroine of this book, because they all have the personality of Aries. The dialogue in the book is so interesting, I like it, especially the phrase ""giving up does not mean not loving, it is because of love that will give the other person the opportunity to choose."" It would be great if I could understand at that time. "
0	The memory should be upgraded to 2G, and the price will be reduced by 300 oceans after purchase. More depressed. The driver is pretty easy to find, but ASUS customer service is not satisfied, telling him that the sound of the speaker is too small, and what he said does not affect the use! Depressed! 
1	Revisiting Sanmao makes me like her straightforwardness and sincerity in love. Sanmao has left our sight, but those who like her will not forget her. All the moving vaguely echoed in my mind. This kind of breath is difficult to capture in current works. Perhaps, because the world has become so illusory, people who like the real miss Sanmao even more. 
1	I feel very good. The guest room manager’s message is very warm. If I go to Shijiazhuang next time, I will choose here. Hotel Feedback August 4, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of the Ambassador Hotel. We look forward to seeing you again! I wish all the best in work and life! 
1	The pre-installed is Linux, not XP. Call the customer service and say that the operating system cannot be changed, or the warranty is out of service. How can there be such a reason? 
1	This computer is the M35 series, which is the latest model this year. It has a beautiful appearance, good heat dissipation, and a fairly solid workmanship. 
1	love it. I gave up the notebook I had been using before. I use it to surf the Internet every day at home and outside. 
1	"Taiwan scholar Taiwan scholar Jiang Xun ""Chinese Art History"" (July 2008, Sanlian Bookstore), as a popular reading, the author can turn the complex history of art into concise and beautiful prose, integrating academicity with readability In the book, it is called a book for everyone, which is really not praise. Without certain academic ability, it is difficult to write such readings. Those who are as weak as me in academic ability are always obscure when talking about Chinese aesthetics, so when I saw this beautifully printed atlas in a bookstore, I decided to buy it. After reading it, I recommended it to many young students. "
0	Inadequate, it is probably a little slow when opening multiple web pages at the same time, haha, this is imaginable. 
1	The standby time is long, although it didn't take up to 9.5 hours, it's considered enough. Performance is sufficient for processing office software. 
1	The touchpad can burn your fingers after being turned on for 20 minutes. Check carefully that the fan does not turn, blow it hard and turn it again, and restart it. Observing the fan turning and not turning over a few days is really a two-fold sky 
0	The battery life is standard 2-5 hours, and it only takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes during the video, somehow? 
1	"It has been a long time since ""Shishuo Xinyu"", from the initial appreciation to the beginning of careful study, and then to the cooling of enthusiasm, ""Shishuo"" has witnessed my entire academic career. Helplessly, the horse's teeth are good, but the knowledge is deteriorating, and it is only a mess. The daily price is rushing for the livelihood, no longer the hunger and thirst of the year, I bought a lot of books, but most of them are set up in the high pavilion, and there is little leisure to look through. When I look back, the dust accumulates, and He Qing sighs. It's so hard for me to do my best for the books, so I don't want to read a book without reading the poor house, borrowing a glass of wine from others, to eliminate the block in my chest. "
1	Very beautiful, great value choice, intel's solid state drive is really not covered, very satisfied with the actual test! 
1	3899 yuan, high cost performance, good overall use feeling, beautiful appearance and high brightness. The installation system is general and not particularly troublesome. 
1	"I haven't seen the movie of the same name played by Audrey Hepburn, and after watching this, I can't imagine the heroine as a beauty of Hepburn's temperament. In the depths of her soul, Holly is as proud as a cat, self, longing for freedom and unconstrained. After throwing away the cat, she really realized this: ""We belong to each other, and she is mine."" Her life is destined to wander, looking for a place that can really quiet her soul. I don't want to comment on Zhang Yueran's preface. She doesn't seem to understand Hao Li. "
0	It's just a guest house, the facilities are not good, the towels are all broken. And the shorts and socks I washed the day before hung in the bathroom and forgot when I checked out. As a result, I went to ask again and said I didn't see it. That's it. 
1	Notebooks within 4k, perfect screen, good keyboard, and excellent heat dissipation. The 14.1 package I sent, just packed the books. 
0	"In Kashgar, if you book through ctrip, this is one of only two options. Advantages: In the Han area, there is a night market nearby and broadband in the room. Disadvantages: Although it is OK in Kashgar, the conditions are still very poor (yes, I live in the ""VIP Building"" here), I feel that the room is old for 20 years; I can’t swipe the card at all (although they still ask you to use it) Credit card guarantee...); broadband settings are cumbersome, and you need to set a user name and password; breakfast is also poor, and the travel agency set up on the first floor is more expensive than other places. It is recommended that latecomers do not see that there is broadband here or make reservations through ctrip to book this one, which may affect your travel mood. Kashgar has now heard that a four-star hotel has been built, opened by the Southwest Petroleum Administration of Tajikistan. I guess it will be better than this. "
1	Regardless of the airport shuttle, the stay is generally good, suitable for ordinary guests, and it is the kind of hotel that will generally not cause any problems. 
0	"As a business economy chain hotel, overall it is affordable. In such a prosperous area, the price is also affordable. But other hotels offer better services and facilities at the same price, which is by comparison. Overall, I feel that the level of facility management is not high, which also leads to unsatisfactory cleanliness. The design of the room itself is not refreshing and clean. The bathroom facilities also feel unhygienic. It is a mediocre hotel. I feel disappointed when I come to a hotel with such a loud brand. Among the hotels of the same type, I sorted them according to the level of standards: Jinjiang Inn ""IKEA""..."" Motel. There is an ellipsis between IKEA and Motel, which means that there can be some things I don't know about, so Jiuyue won't be on the table. I only consider Jinjiang and IKEA, these two brands have achieved the effect of brand guarantee. Additional comments August 7, 2007: Air conditioning leaks! serious! It's like running water. Fortunately, it was morning, I immediately turned off the air conditioner, and then used the kettle to collect water and filled half a pot of water. "
1	It costs 12 yuan to take a taxi to the passenger terminal (plus 1 yuan fuel fee). It is economical, so I can barely satisfy it, mainly because the price is there. If you have the opportunity, you will get it. It is mainly close to the largest amusement park in Shandong Province. Fuhua Amusement Park is better and convenient to play. 
0	The hotel is seriously misnamed. The so-called deluxe business room is a general standard room, and the suite is an extra standard room. The facilities are outdated and seriously fooled. 
1	The machine is ok. I bought it for my friend. Jingdong’s speed is good. The order in the afternoon was delivered the next morning. Like one 
1	The grammar points covered in this book are all comprehensive, which is completely sufficient for beginners and intermediate learners. My teacher recommended to me when I first learned French. I have watched it for a year, and I feel very good, basically all the grammar points can be found. And the classification inside is clear and detailed, from general to special, which is very helpful for learning French. However, some parts of the book are too detailed, and some parts are a bit too complicated, which can easily discourage the enthusiasm for learning~ My French teacher said that many of the above knowledge points can not even be taught in French. If you want to learn French systematically, it’s better to keep a copy 
1	No need to paint. The delivery was very fast. The order placed on the morning of the 25th was received on the morning of the 26th. very satisfied 
0	The 1G memory is too low for Vista, and I feel that the heat dissipation needs to be improved. The hard disk temperature rose very quickly when I used it last time. 
0	When the book arrived, it was all wet, but I called your customer service and said that someone would be arranged to pick up the book and do the refund procedure. But now, I have ordered the book 3 times with you , The money that should be refunded that time has not been refunded, and the book that should be refunded has not been picked up? Is it too efficient? I have complained once, and I hope not this time. The complaint is not the content of this book, but the service attitude. Suffering from other complaints, both phone calls and online messages were used, but they didn't work, so try it here. 
0	There is no XP system disk trouble, I don’t know if it is the network card, the local connection is always unstable~~To be checked 
0	The border of the screen is the fingerprint collector. Every time the screen brightness is lowered and restarted, it becomes the highest again 
0	When I just got it, I need a lot of software that comes with the Vista system, which feels useless. The hard disk has no partition. I installed a memory stick, but the speed is still slow. 
1	I have stayed at this hotel with friends a few times before, and it feels good overall that parking is very convenient. This time I went to Yibin and chose to live here. The location of the hotel is better, the traffic is convenient, and the surrounding is more lively. There is a barbecue next to the evening, which is very convenient for eating and lodging. The decoration of the lobby is OK, the rooms are a bit dated, and the quality of service will be good. 
1	I buy it for my family, and the computer professionals around me like it. I have been using IBM, with few maintenance and low failure rate. 
0	"Anti-virus software and office2007 are both 60-day trial version. It is a bit troublesome to use the camera in QQ. You must first change the video device to ""USB Video Device"" in the settings. The six-cell battery protrudes a little bit. The hard disk vibrates a little bit bigger. The screen elevation angle is too big. Turn over "
0	These are the worst in the novels that I have read so far, the worst in romance novels, and the bottom two books in court stories. It's a waste of money~~~ alas~~~~ 
1	As a mystery novel may not be the best, as a romance novel may not be the best. But the combination is amazing. Envious of that kind of love and that kind of life, maybe all murderers have a very sad life. It is a kind of pain and helplessness that ordinary people cannot understand. If they can get a love, they might have a better life. It is really gratifying that Yuanyuan and Lu Jin’s love can have lovers finally get married. No matter where they live or what environment they live in, they must find someone who can give and give everything. 
1	The price-performance ratio is very high. The 3299 was grabbed, and it was restored to the original price soon. The notebook looks good, and the delivery speed is relatively fast. 
0	Very rubbish book, many of the words in this book are not commonly used, and the memory method is far different than that in the commentary. And there is no phonetic transcription, etc. 
0	The biggest advantage is that the price is relatively affordable, and there is free parking (if you live in the ancient town, you are not allowed to drive in during the day). The waiters in this hotel all say that the local snacks made in their restaurant are delicious. I really don’t agree. The portion is small, the taste is not authentic, but the price is not low. It is recommended that friends who value local cuisine do not eat in the hotel’s restaurant. The snacks produce the wrong impression. 
0	1. The battery life is not good (4 cores after all). It can only be used for about 1 and a half hours on the Internet when the brightness is half turned on. It is necessary to buy a spare battery. 2. USB port power supply is insufficient, friends who like to use USB devices pay attention. 3. Graphics card, 3d is the bottleneck of this machine, high-definition video is enough 
1	It costs 12 yuan to take a taxi to the passenger terminal (plus 1 yuan fuel fee). It is economical, so I can barely satisfy it, mainly because the price is there. If you have the opportunity, you will get it. It is mainly close to the largest amusement park in Shandong Province. Fuhua Amusement Park is better and convenient to play. 
0	The power adapter is too hot, it will be very hot after plugging it in for a while, I am really afraid of burning out, I hope it can be improved 
1	The original 5199 model is out of stock. I chose this chip. The hard drive is better, and it's cost-effective. It's very good and the performance is very powerful. 
0	What a bad hotel, there was only one waiter when I checked in at the front desk. The waiter called my colleague by his name, and the colleague even said that he felt that his beautiful classmates from the university were calling him. The so-called business room we lived in was on the 7th floor with an elevator. You can only go to the 6th floor. When you get to the room, you can see that this 7th floor should have been converted into guest rooms, or even an illegal building. The toilets are very small and are the kind of integrated products used on the plane you bought. The room couldn't be connected to the Internet. I couldn't jump up after pressing the button on the phone. I called the waiter in my colleague's room. After a long time, two stunned northeastern girls came up with an enthusiastic attitude, but they were completely rookies. 
0	I didn't remember many words with it! If you want to learn vocabulary, there are many ways, there is no need to buy this to waste money, but I regret it! 
1	I have never thought that there is such a terrible malicious existence in the world. The most vicious emotion comes from the most fragile and soft heart of mankind. The incident was overwhelming, but there was still a faint light, and the ending was reversed again and again, and I felt that my heart could not bear the heaviness of the malicious invasion. This ending is not an accident or shock that can be described. I can't use words to express the complicated feelings in my heart, and I keep trembling. I don't know if I like this kind of story, what it reveals, what it wants to tell people, is too heavy for me to bear. Unexpectedly, mystery novels can be written like this. 
0	The hotel facilities are good. But the location is too far. It is very inconvenient to wait for a taxi to arrive, so I asked the door boy Bang to call a taxi the next morning to bid for my ten yuan handling fee. The western restaurant is really bad. The western food ordered I can’t even eat it and I asked the chef to say that it’s not authentic Western food. It’s unacceptable, and the price is as high as other hotels. Never choose this hotel next time 
0	Generally speaking, everyone’s feedback is good, but I feel that it is average. Although the narrative is in plain and easy-to-understand language, there is no lack of humor, but I just can’t enter it. I’m sleepy when I lie in bed many times and look at it. ~ 
0	Quite boring book. The content is very close to life, maybe because it is too close to life, but there is nothing to see. 
0	I chose cash on delivery, but told me that I can't deliver it to my door. I am in Baoan Fuyong, Shenzhen, which belongs to the town, so why can't it be delivered? Dangdang should think of a way. This is the first time I have ordered a book. If so, it will only drive customers away. 
0	I really don't like this style of writing, this simple and straightforward use of words. But my colleagues saw it very well and were moved to tears. Ugh--------- 
1	The sign is old enough and loud enough to go to the sign, the result is very sad! Ugh. . . . . . . 
1	It is indeed a good book for family education. I am the parent of 2 children and have been in middle school education for more than ten years. After reading this book, on the one hand, it allowed me to reflect on my own methods of educating children, and on the other hand, I was fortunate to read this book early. After reading, I have a profound experience: the education method is different for each child, but the educational philosophy is definitely the same, that is, to give full play to the initiative of the child and let the child learn with interest. The author's method of educating her children, I also tried to teach my daughter. Found that the effect is really good. 
0	1. The hotel is in black and white tones, which feels gloomy. . It is recommended that friends who like this type of film live 2. The bed looks like a tatami mat, and it's short and messy, so I suggest Japanese friends live 3. The glass in the bath room is actually transparent. It is recommended to have friends who like to be naked to live. 4. The toilet in the room is broken. Every time you flush it, you must open the ceramic lid to repair it. It is recommended that friends who like DIY live. Additional comments March 12, 2008: Not to mention the TV show, the so-called 5star standard, shame. . . There is no place to eat, and you have to go out for 20 minutes to Jiuzhou Road. The restaurant downstairs is only suitable for arrogant guests. . 
0	"I placed an order for three books on January 29, 2008. One of them is ""Dulala's Promotion"", order number: 1457306335; I would like to ask why the editor is missing 17 pages? Jump directly from page 218 to page 235? Is Dangdang responsible for the quality of books like this? Please reply as soon as possible. "
0	Seeing the good reviews from everyone, I also became curious about it, but after I bought it, I didn't feel any special feeling. It seems that the book is not good or not, only appropriate. 
1	This book has taught me many ways to guide/educate children. It has benefited me a lot. I thought I would be good at educating children. After reading this book, I realized that what I have mastered is too superficial. Many children's behaviors can reflect the effects of mothers in education. The children's personality is mainly guided by the usual mothers' behaviors. It is not completely inherited. This book has taught me too much, and it is recommended that no parent buy it. One book. Let our baby grow up healthy and happy, let happiness, self-confidence, bravery, open-mindedness, integrity, and kindness accompany him throughout his life 
0	Too mysterious, but not credible. It's been a month since I bought it for my parents, but it's still brand new, and I'm not interested at all. I saw that so many people sought after, and always suggested that they read it, but I read a few pages and threw it aside, exaggerating----- 
1	High score screen, good luck! I don't know the performance yet. Install a game in a few days. The appearance is okay. 
1	The price of the single room is excellent value for money. The breakfast is good. The service is good and very user-friendly. Hehe, the first time I encountered a hotel with petals in the toilet. However, the hotel's bathing center and beauty salons cannot be used during the decoration. It was not mentioned when booking. 
1	In general, it has benefited a lot! I have read many books related to Chinese medicine, and I have always been confused about my own body constitution. It always has the characteristics of both cold and hot constitutions. Now I finally know that this is wet. I didn't expect that some inadvertent lifestyle habits would cause so many consequences. It turns out that the body has already sent out so many warning signals! Many of the health preservation in the book are achieved through acupuncture points. The introduction of acupuncture points in this book is more suitable for people who have no basis in Chinese medicine, and it is more operable. There are also some practical prescriptions and simple fitness methods. Unwinding is useful and worth reading repeatedly. 
0	When I ordered, I saw a comment on the Internet saying that the wrong item was sent, and I was worried for a long time. The result was really wrong when I received the item. After I returned it, I re-ordered, I wonder if there will be a sending error, worry... .. 
0	I have been buying a book with you Dangdang. It was not long after Du Lala was promoted to buy it. But when I opened the book after it was opened, I found that no less than 10 pages are in white edition-the wordless book! Is it returned to you, and you mail a new one? Or what? It took more than a month to get an invoice before, but it hasn't been resolved until now! Please reply me more efficiently! 
0	It feels so-so and knows the truth, but there is no operational guidance. Maybe young girls who have just entered society can take a look and expand their thinking. 
0	Hotel facilities are seriously aging. As a five-star hotel, there is no smoke-free floor (this is what the hotel attendant said when registering at the front desk) 
1	The appearance is very eye-catching, the speed is okay, and the system is difficult to install. Fortunately, there is a master classmate in the bedroom, but it took half an hour. 
0	Obviously don’t laugh, I’m an English vocabulary book. The content is very general. It feels like a piece of book. After I bought it, I read the comments on Dangdang. Please also use snacks 
1	"Correct the typo in my comment in the first sentence above, ""I have been reading this book, thank you for this book and the author..."" "
0	The service attitude of the clerk is average, and the order of picking goods is a bit messy. HP's installation system is quite annoying, especially the sound card and network card 
0	The shortcomings are temporarily discovered: Piano paint is easy to fray, the mirror screen is highly reflective, the button cover feels not tight enough, the fan sound is annoying, it is troublesome to find the driver to install the machine, the process of upgrading the memory is painful 
1	The hotel has a good location and is very convenient in the city center. Hotel service is good, breakfast is rich and delicious. The computer speed and broadband speed of the business digital room I live in is satisfactory. I will live here in Nanjing in the future. 
0	I stayed at this hotel on July 22, because I made a reservation on Ctrip.com, and it was quite fast to check in at the front desk. It's just that the hardware of the hotel is really unsatisfactory, and it is not directly proportional to the price. I chose this hotel with the attitude of investigating the hotel, and it turned out that something very irritating really happened. I would like to show everyone here: The room I lived in was a six-story suite, and the door needed a lot of force. The shower head in the bathroom in the bedroom seems to be rusty, and there is not much water coming out. Since I work as a hotel, I have to check the linen by myself when I check out and then call the housekeeping department to ask them to come and check the room. This can reduce my check-out time. I remember very clearly at the time: there was a small square in the toilet outside, I used it and put it on the tray, I hadn’t touched other toiletries; there were two small squares in the bathroom in the bedroom (one on the bedside table, One is placed on the marble countertop of the bathroom) When the CHECK OUT arrived, the housekeeper claimed that a square towel was missing. I said that I was at the front desk and had not left the shop. Either you search my bag or check out for me. You can't put unnecessary charges on me! The front desk insisted not to check out for me, and no assistant manager in the lobby came forward to coordinate this matter. Because I had to attend the banquet at noon, I could only compensate the hotel with 10 yuan for the loss of the scarf. Ten yuan is a small matter, but the way the hotel handles problems is a big deal. What the hotel does is hardware and software services. It is really worrying for your hotel to solve the problem like this~ Please be cautious when choosing this hotel, because it is very likely that due to the carelessness of the housekeeper, you will shirk your responsibility. On the guests, there is no way to prove the results, the guests can only eat coptis! If you must stay in a hotel, I recommend the Home Inn on Taoyuan Road and the Home Inn on Beiqi Square. The price is high, the service is very good, and the breakfast is varied and delicious! 
0	Attracted by the name, misled by other people’s comments, I bought it back, and I don’t know what’s funny. It’s a classified vocabulary book with illustrations that are not salty or light. I don’t know where it reflects that it can make you remember more easily. Feeling fooled! ! ! 
1	The hotel staff was very nice and sent two small dolls to the room at night. But the alcoholic breakfast buffet is really not a compliment. Because the restaurant is open, there is no air-conditioning (the same is true for Sheraton, but there are also closed air-conditioned restaurants, and guests can choose by themselves). Although the sea breeze is frequent, there is still a little sweat. If you eat freshly cooked rice noodles, it will be very hot. But the most unbearable are the flies and mosquitoes. The flies fly or stop on the food, and the mosquitoes circle around us. So every time we order breakfast, we order it and finish it at a super fast speed. 
1	1. The front desk service in the lobby is fast and efficient. 2. The air in the guest room and the room is not good, and the ventilation is poor. 3. The room is clean, but the furnishings and configuration are too simple. 4. The breakfast variety of the restaurant on the third floor is acceptable, the service is under-trained, and the two-star standard. 5. The restaurant menu on the second floor is rich in seafood, but there are too few vegetarian dishes. It feels so so, not as good as the Jin Yan next door. 
0	The writing is mediocre, the writing is mediocre, the historical materials are not detailed, the online reviews are exaggerated, and the amateur authors are playing a ticket. It is not recommended to buy, just download it! 
0	We didn't receive the book at all. I don't know what happened. I didn't receive a call. The book is almost one month old. What kind of business is this, I hope the business will contact us as soon as possible to explain the situation. 02800923158 
0	You can't use ghost directly, but you can use the CD to start ghost11, which is much more convenient, you can try. 
1	The price is cheaper than Zhongguancun. The battery capacity is really good. It takes about 6 hours to watch the movie. I like the appearance. I personally think it looks better than NC10. The screen color is not good enough. The graphics card is really not good. When watching rmvb movies, if there are other operations, the screen will be stuck. , But it’s a netbook after all. It can be tolerated. Summary: Although it is only 10 inches, the screen font is clear, and the screen is not small at all. It is generally light and easy to carry. After a day in Zhongguancun, I didn’t find a cheaper price than this. worth buying 
0	A strong personality makes people not so comfortable. I don't like it personally. If everyone should follow this as an example, then the workplace becomes terrible. 
0	The hardware and software are average. Do not disturb reminders, and the waiter knocks on the door in the morning. Pillows and beds are not comfortable. Will not order again 
1	The price/performance ratio has nothing to say, the workmanship is okay, but the CD-ROM drive is a bit loose, and the logistics is too great. I arrived in Weifang, Shandong in two days. It is still free. I ordered two sets. 
1	The price is reasonable, the hidden value of hardware and software is great, and it is excellent value for money. Especially the 1G memory is given away, and the price is not mentioned, eliminating the trouble of DIY. 
1	The cost performance is relatively high, the configuration is relatively balanced, watching movies and playing ordinary games are relatively smooth. Very affordable. 
0	The hotel is relatively old, I heard that it has more than ten years of history and the rooms are relatively small. A so-called three-star hotel doesn't even provide disposable razors, it costs another 15 yuan to buy it. Generally not as good as the business hotels around the railway station. 
1	Read half of it in one go. It was discovered that there is no absolutely perfect system. Only by considering the times, personnel, culture, customs and other factors, can we understand the origin of the system at that time. The system established at the beginning of the dynasty was beneficial at the time, but various factors changed in the later period, and the system did not change, but was called a negative bondage. I think that the reason why our country is able to develop rapidly may be due to continuous self-change. With the development of the times, abandon the useless and develop useful, this is the real way to strengthen the country. 
0	The reinstallation system does not support WINXP, it is inconvenient to change BOIS settings, and it requires third-party software to change the hard disk interface settings! You must use third-party software to install XP, depressed! ! ! 
1	"In ""Dream of Xiaoran"", remember that Bingyi is a dreamless person. How can he dream in this book? After Bingyi practiced water magic and had nightmares, Qi Ran could also testify. "
1	"The location is better. It is convenient for shopping and sightseeing on the streets of West Street, quiet in the noisy, and the facilities in the room are also OK. Although there is a gap between the four stars in the city, it should be the best hotel in Yangshuo Up. But there are still some uncomfortable places in my heart, because I forgot to write a double room when I booked a room on Ctrip. I gave a double room when I checked in. When I asked the front desk to deal with it, the reply was that there was no room, but in fact there was Of the room. Therefore, it is hoped that the hotel needs further improvement in the concept of caring for customers. The local tour guide was very hospitable and simple. The lunch at the ""Bu Gao Men"" at the foot of Moon Mountain was affordable and delicious, praise. It is a pity that the photos taken while drifting on the Yulong River are missing. In general, the trip is very happy, if I have time, I will choose to go to Yangshuo again. "
0	"The hype is so hot, it may be just our wishful thinking, the baby usually likes to listen to stories, but she is not interested in this set of books. I can only watch it, sleepy... exhausted... our family doesn't have ""foreign language"" genes... "
0	The room booked by Ctrip on the same day arrived at the hotel in less than one hour, but I was told that the room type was no longer available. I don’t know how the hotel is managed. If the reservation is not made in good faith, then don’t rely on Ctrip. ! Moreover, he gave feedback to Ctrip with untrue information. It was clear that he checked in, but there was no feedback! This time the reservation was made for my client, but it caused such troubles! Will not consider this hotel again in the future! 
1	1: The carpet is dirty, and the utensils such as the kettle and the toilet are aging 2: The service is very good 3: The geothermal mineral water is good 
1	1. Convenient transportation and close to the subway station; 2. Quiet, clean and comfortable; 3. The price is relatively expensive (house prices, dining, Internet access). 
1	The appearance is stylish, the performance of the machine is not bad, the front hand touch? Very practical and convenient, accompanied by a white indicator light, very stylish! 
0	1. The heat dissipation is really general, especially the upper left corner, it will be hotter after using it for a while, of course it will not be hot. 2. The location of the power socket is too close to the optical drive, which prevents the optical drive from ejecting. 3. The built-in speaker is relatively poor, but the notebook is basically like that. If you want to pursue good sound effects, you must be external. 
1	Baby likes it very much, I have watched it several times. The printing is exquisite and the paper is thick. Although it is black and white, the expressions of boys, dogs and frogs are very delicate and vivid. No loss is the work of the master. Each book is about 20 pages, not very thick. Compared to the quality and content of the book, this price is pretty good. And this book personally thinks that the age group covered is quite large. After all, it is a non-word book that can be read by small babies. The rich sentiment conveyed in the story is that children in elementary school will not feel too naive. Recommended! 
0	I don't like the style of the pictures in the book, and the story is too simple to be interesting. My son doesn't like this book either. 
0	The camera dropped when the goods were received, and the image was only half of the shot, and half of it was black. No other problem. I don't want to change it when I am in a hurry. Heat dissipation is not very good 
1	I bought it at 4499, ATI3470's independent 256 graphics card, and it also comes with an HDMI interface and a VGA interface. 
0	1. The sense of service is too bad; I booked a big bed room through Ctrip. After entering the room, I found that the carpet in the room was really dirty. I negotiated with the duty manager and asked for a room change. The answer is actually: there is no double room, either you will be replaced with a deluxe double room, but you have to make up the difference, or you will be replaced by a standard room. Can't figure out how to do the service industry? The inconvenience caused to the guests due to his own work mistakes seems to be right, and he is very confident. 2. The environment is too noisy 3. Breakfast can only be described as terrible, no matter if you don't eat it. Please stay away! ! ! 
1	After adding memory, the speed is very fast. It looks good to run XP, and the delivery is also good, just what I need 
1	Recommend the Japanese-style big bed room here, it is very comfortable! Don't live in a room without windows, it is very boring, it is best to live on the fifth floor, the third floor sky garden will attract a lot of bugs. 
1	The facilities are a bit aging, but after all, it's a place to keep quiet! The stuff for washing is quite complete! 
0	Vista is a bit slow, but XP would be fine. 250G has only one partition, which is really useless. Without any system CD and driver, it is inconvenient to carry it. I want to change the XP partition by myself. I checked it on the Internet. It is not a normal trouble. I have not dared to do it. 
1	After taking the book back, the son couldn't wait to open it and look at it. I like construction sites, airports, and train stations the most. I always rummaged through them by myself. Because the little guy always yells about going to take a plane or a train, it makes people feel a headache. These books can satisfy his curiosity in this respect. Before my son went to bed, I also sat down and read a short paragraph to him. The two of them looked for the characters on the tree together. It was very fun. In fact, reading should be a pleasant thing. Since you can't travel thousands of miles often, let others take a look at the colorful world first. 
1	I called the hotel to ask for directions. The switchboard said that I didn’t know. I transferred to the concierge. Several guys were not familiar with it. They couldn’t tell the east and west directions, but I finally said a landmark building that gave me a direction. I asked the business center to buy a map to send it up. It said that the concierge was busy, and it had to wait half an hour to unload other guests. Just wait, but after waiting for a full hour and a half, it was only delivered after a phone call. The room is clean, but the bathroom is too small to turn around. I left something when I checked out, and the waiter didn't find it in the round. I found it by calling the front desk and checking again. Generally speaking, it is good to live in such a hotel in Jilin, but the price is not cheap at all. Both hardware and service are four-star standards. 
1	"After reading ""The Devil Wearing PRADA"", I will look at this Chinese fashion novel. I feel that there is only one sentence. First of all, we must survive, and then talk about other things. Seeing him in fresh clothes, seeing him in a beautiful car, seeing him with dark eyes With a pale face, seeing him go from innocence to the city. Is the workplace so miserable? To be fair, in such an environment, people will definitely become smarter and their abilities will definitely be greatly improved in a short period of time. On the other hand, This is really good. "
0	I originally thought that there would be some words to complement the illustrations, but the result was a full-page picture. I felt that the content was too simple and had no connotation. Just like a baby pictorial, the content was not rich enough, the price was not cheap, and it was not cost-effective. 
0	Our family chose this hotel on the last day of a four-day tour in Xiamen, and I regretted it. Let me talk about transportation first. The hotel has its own pier, but there is only one boat per hour. If you miss it, you have to wait. And the pier is also very simple, our family has old and small, every time we get on and off the boat, we have to be careful. Besides the environment, we booked a deluxe room and ran in to take a look: the facilities inside were outdated, the wardrobe door was difficult to close, and the floor was not cleaned. The worst thing is that the air conditioner can only be used for cooling, and the bathroom does not have a bathroom heater. In winter, the island is still 1-2 degrees lower than the urban area. Turn on the faucet, the water is yellow, the hot water is also very small, not to mention taking a bath, washing your face is reluctant. Open the curtains, and there is a construction site outside! Living in a hotel, the heart is colder than the weather... People who like quietness will probably like it, because apart from the two people at the reception, the other staff are basically rare to see, so you have to figure out what you want. Originally wanted to make a local call, but told me that it costs 10 yuan/day to open a local call, dizzy! I'll make an inquiry call, or use my mobile phone! 
1	I used a 50 yuan coupon and spent 2649 to get it. The price is invincible. Of course, if you start with 3199, there is no advantage in price. The product inherits ASUS's consistent quality and all aspects of workmanship are better than MSI. Why compare with MSI’s, because I have bought MSI’s U90 and U100 before, which should have a say, and the battery has reached an unimaginable eight hours or more. As a netbook, it can basically sweep other brands Now, the price/performance ratio of 2649 is beyond imagination! ! 
0	The facilities are very average, but the attitude of the service staff is not flattering. The breakfast was very poor, a large group of waiters roared around, but no one was paying attention 
0	Don't live in this place, with an embroidered pillow. It looks good. Nothing else. If you don't turn on the air conditioner in cold weather, they say that they don't think it is necessary to turn on. You are so angry that you will die. I moved on the second day, 
0	I booked a room for 2 nights with my friend. The waiter said that he hadn't booked 2 nights the next morning and asked to check out. The attitude was extremely bad. My friend was worried and contacted me many times. 
1	I bought EPC1000HE on JD.com on May 25th. I also bought Lenovo’s X61T (a friend brought it back in the United States, (*^__^*) hee hee...), so I wanted to sell a 1000HE, black, original box The original packaging of JD.com is all there. It’s best if you’re from Dongguan. It’s brand new, with a keyboard film made of Kuqi Nano Silver. It’s absolutely brand new. The invoices and documents are complete. JD.com gave me a lot. Please contact me on QQ 282369262. Mobile phone 13431221132 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, inside Zhongshan Mausoleum, next to Meihua Mountain, very close. But the room rate is not directly proportional to the price. The lobby is luxurious but deserted; the room in 528 is clean and the service is good, but the facilities are outdated. For example, the toilet cover is actually a plastic cover that looks old and the chairs in the room are also very old. . If the price drops to 300 to 350, it is about the same. 
1	The price-performance ratio is relatively high, and the package and anti-virus software are given, plus the mouse, mouse pad, cleaning kit, plus 50 coupons, and the total is less than 4200. I decided to buy it after seeing 2 senior sisters who used this good 
1	All aspects are general, as long as the expectations are not too high. 
1	High performance-price ratio, good graphics card, can run Call of Duty 4 smoothly without AA, the frame rate remains above 30, heat dissipation is also good, and it will not be very hot after playing Call of Duty 4 for 3 hours. The official website has complete XP drivers, and it is very convenient to install XP now. 
1	High cost performance and fast delivery. Place the order the day before and it will arrive at noon the next day. The screen is very good and watching movies is very comfortable. 
0	"This is a perfect book! Seeing Lala seems to see myself. I am also a sales assistant and administrative director. So when I read this book, I regard Lala as myself. The inner feelings of the characters are surprisingly similar to me, so I am more Can appreciate the feelings of the protagonist Lala and understand Lala's actions. I was lost too, it was Lara that gave me the motivation to move forward! As a newcomer to society, I always act emotionally and do things too straightforwardly. I have to constantly learn social experience and know how to deal with others so that I can continue to improve. Many principles in the book are very practical, and sometimes I will deliberately ask myself how to do it. Sometimes I complain because I seem to be the busiest in the company, but my salary is still the lowest. Lara is my role model, and my industry role model, I want to improve, as long as I work hard, I will definitely improve! ""Du Lala's Promotion"" is a good book worth reading! "
1	I booked a double room for 430 yuan. The room size and facilities are good. The bathroom only has a shower room, which is very practical, which I admire. The breakfast is also good, both Chinese and Western. Disadvantages: The hotel restaurant closes at 8pm. In order to remind the guests who are still dining, the lights are turned off. It makes people feel like eating in a bar. It feels like this service is not four-star enough; the hotel does not have a parking lot, and the parking is right there. The small piece of dried tofu at the gate, and it also charges for the hotel guests, which is not convenient for motorists; the hotel gave us two rooms close to the elevator, and the clinking of the elevators stopped one after another overnight, making it impossible Fall asleep. I have encountered many times that the rooms arranged by the hotel for Ctrip guests are relatively unsatisfactory, I hope it is not this time. The shop opposite the hotel is famous for selling thousands of packs. I couldn't go this time because of the tight schedule, so I must try it next time. After getting off the highway and driving across the South Taihu Bridge in the evening, the evening sunlight and the newly lit lights flooded the bridge and the new city along the way. It was very beautiful. The first time I went to Huzhou, although I was in a hurry, I left a great impression. I plan to stay internationally next time I go on vacation (hope that the elevator bell will be improved next time). However, the consumption in Huzhou is not as good as that in Shanghai. The price of Ctrip is not very competitive. force. In recent years, Ctrip's housing prices are not competitive. Ctrip is equivalent to a travel agency and should be able to get far better prices than individual customers. Should we respond to many loyal users in this regard? 
0	Very poor and poor service. The room is relatively large, but also very poor, and more importantly, it is close to the railway, very noisy! No wonder the hotel business is not good and there are few people! 
1	It is cheap and easy to use, economical, and has a long standby time at the beginning, which may be related to the special power management mode software. 
1	The hotel is far from the city, but there is a shuttle bus to the hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui an hour, the facilities in the room are relatively old, but the external environment is very good, the air is also very good, there is a beach not far from the hotel, which is very suitable for vacation , The breakfast variety is also relatively rich. I will go to live next time, the environment there is really good. For example, the heart hotel is much better. 
1	This is Xinghuo recommended by a friend. I have never used something Xinghuo before, and I bought it in the last week before the exam... First of all, the delivery speed is so fast, it arrived in 3 days; then, I really like the gift inside. The disc, in addition to the listening of the real questions, lectures on test methods, and high-frequency vocabulary sentence making, I think it is very useful~~ Finally, although it is too late to use it in the last week, I think he gave me a lot Great psychological support... I am more optimistic about the brand of Xinghuo when I bought this book. If I want to buy it in the future, Xinghuo must be the first choice~~~O(∩_∩)O haha~ 
0	I am completely disappointed with the ATI driver. I have used several models of ATI graphics cards and often have blue screens. This is no exception. I really don’t understand why the drivers of such a big company do so badly. 
1	The hotel is very quiet and the location is not easy to find. I turned around at the intersection of Changning Road and Zunyi and didn't see it. After getting off the Zhongshan Park subway station, go west along Changning Road on the right, pass the Zhongshan Intersection (via elevated), and then go forward. The road on the left is Zunyi Road. Don’t turn, keep going (Changning Road, keep walking on the right side) ), an alley, 1600 Changning Road hangs at the entrance of the alley. The hotel is very close to the subway station and Longemont Shopping Center. It is very convenient for shopping, eating and transportation. Value for money! But the price difference with Jinjiang Inn is too small, 239 and 249. If Ctrip can give you a discount, it would be great! Additional comments April 1, 2008: To add, Jinjiang Inn’s membership price is lower than Ctrip, only 224. If you have a membership card, don’t order it on Ctrip. The membership card needs to be bought for 158 yuan. It is a good deal if you live frequently 
0	In fact, I like the content of this book, but I think the quality of this book is very poor. Today I received a new book from your website, but there are serious creases on the cover of the book. Is this how your website operates? 
1	Since I did not stay in person, it was a friend. The hotel seems to be newly renovated, so it feels pretty good. The price is relatively high. 
0	Very poor service! ! ! ! A few friends and I made an appointment to go to Tianjin. For the convenience of everyone playing cards at night, I specifically booked a 2-bedroom and 1-living room in this hotel. Because I arrived first, I naturally registered to open the room first. I was afraid that the hotel would not let me stay if the room reservation time expired. But what I met was the front desk clerk coldly instructing me to register everyone's ID card, otherwise I would not be allowed to go to the elevator! I am surprised, is this the service of a four-star hotel? ! ! ! ! Annoyingly, when my friends were all here and after registering, they found that there was only one person in the room with toiletries and slippers. In other words, the hotel uses this method to prevent us from checking into the room without checking in! It makes me angry! ! ! ! I spent more than six hundred dollars to stay in this so-called 4-star hotel, just to enjoy this inferior service? ! ! ! The nightmare was not over yet. When I checked out the next day, the cashier at the front desk had a phone call with someone for nearly 10 minutes because of my room price. I don’t know if I was deceived by the hotel or by CTRIP. In short, the hotel is so disappointing tonight! Strongly request CRRIP to refund my room fee! Additional comments June 3, 2008: There is a problem with CTRIP's rating. I gave 2 2 points and 2 1 points. Why did you give an average score of 2 points? Are you going to continue to mislead consumers? ! 
1	The order is: aluminum alloy shell, upgradeable 2-year warranty (not verified), long standby time, large keyboard, Gb network card, genuine vista. 
1	This young couple who loves life is really a wonderful combination. Through the lens of sissi, the key words of the Aegean Sea are caught in one go: deep, blue and white, fairy tale, romantic, bright... and the small details that are ignored by ordinary people, the unique perspective of women The exquisite pictures are exquisite and the hawky text is relaxed and humorous, and there is love between the lines; the text also contains various travel tips. Intimate and practical. What is commendable is their shared thoughts. This book takes your eyes and heart to travel. . 
1	The soundproofing is poor, and people outside the room can speak clearly. Anything else is okay, dare to have any extravagance in Ganzhou 
0	I swear, I won't stay in this hotel again, the service is very poor, the 4-star hotel has no doorman to open the door and pick up luggage. Only the security urged TAXI to leave immediately, even if our luggage is still in the back box! ! ! ! Additional comments September 1, 2006: Hey, anyway, Ruian has a very bad impression of the city. TAXI often refuses to load and has a very bad temper. The city is dirty and the service is the worst in the country! 
1	I made a mistake when sending it, sorry. This review is aimed at You Shu Mi. Regarding solo China, I feel the same as the above. 
0	Old-fashioned three-star hotel, single room 240 yuan, room without window, who told us to run to Chengdu when we met the sugar and wine party, the taxi stand at the hotel entrance could not be called for half an hour, it was purely for people to suffer. . The feeling of the hotel: the corridors are broken like guest houses. By the 9:30 breakfast, I passed by 9 o'clock, and the meal was no longer available. The food was no longer served until I ate and breakfast, so I saw the waiter take some steamed buns to deal with it. Communicating with an omelette man in the restaurant, it is said that breakfast ends at 9:30, I said it seems that it hasn't reached 9:30. Such a hotel is estimated to be doing business during the fair, and there will never be a second visit. 
1	I use IBM's books the most and I feel the best. A lot of other manufacturers have worn out, and some of the old models are now basically garbage. The main purchase of this one is the brand. In the future, except for IBM, I will not buy other brands. There are many advantages, not to repeat them one by one, mainly speed, production technology, robustness and brand preference. 
0	Woo^ I thought this book is easy to learn, but I didn’t expect that I don’t know so many words, and I don’t have phonetic symbols, and I don’t know how to read it. Let alone memorize it. God, and I just read it whenever I want It's all Chinese. Who added Chinese below the English? It's too bad, the article is so good, how can I bother to read English. What is even more angry is that some Chinese are in the lower right corner, and some Chinese are in the lower left corner. Harm. I thought I bought DB! 
1	I like books about university lectures. As long as I read it, I never hesitate to buy it and read it. I can learn a lot from the feast of knowledge and culture. There should be no less than 100 books about lectures like mine. Every time I read, I will have a new feeling, and I have decided that no matter when I see an academic lecture book, I have to buy it and read it well. A person really does not want to be alone and lonely, only to read more and study more. This is my experience of reading for many years. 
0	To be honest, I can’t understand many plots of love in this era. I have opinions. Don’t read this kind of book after 90s. This is the sadness of an era. 
1	Good service, fast checkout, and good taxis at the door. Most importantly, the breakfast is really good. Single rooms are reasonably priced, but standard rooms are not suitable for one person. 
0	I'm really sorry for the four-star title! In December, when the temperature is 2-14 degrees, the air conditioner is only turned on after 8 pm! It is turned off again in the middle of the night! After the complaint, it is reasonable to respond to the government's call: save energy. Hotel friends, would you still dare to stay? 
1	I don’t know if it’s a hard drive or something. It’s been running. It’s not stopping, it’s rhythmic, and you can listen to it as a drum. It’s normal after taking it to ASUS after-sales service! ! Angry~! ! ! I'm so angry~! ! ! It would be a loss in case it gets caught and closed for a year~! ! ! ! 
1	After installing the XP system, I feel that the speed is very fast, and its memory quality is very good, which is comparable to the dual-channel memory speed. The sis chipset is not so bad. The drive disk that comes with is a fool, just install it directly. The machine runs quietly and can meet the needs of most people. 
1	The general feeling is ok, very quiet, and the room is good. Close to National Village and Haigeng Park, you can sit by Dianchi Lake in the evening and listen to the tides. The only downside is that it is inconvenient to take a taxi out at night, but the front desk is also prepared to call a taxi for you. Just say in advance. 
1	It's pretty good in all aspects. At first I thought the deliveryman had written the invoice number wrong, but the post office got it wrong and misunderstood the deliveryman of Jingdong Mall. I apologized to Jingdong Mall. 
1	The location in the center of Shanghai makes it more bullish. However, the price/performance ratio is high in the surrounding hotels, and it is difficult to book a double room. 
0	Fingerprint collectors have poor shell technology, softness, and heat generation. The character is not good, I found a dark spot, and didn't cry. . . You just need 3 points, I can change the machine, I'm depressed 
0	The speaker sound is too small, very thin, much smaller than the dell I used before, the memory is too small, the standby time is short, about two hours, the power adapter is very hot, I call ASUS customer service, and I say that it is not hot and I dare not touch it. It's normal, fainted! 
1	In addition to the smaller memory, a 2G Samsung memory is added, which looks good. The specific performance needs to be further explored. The hp protect tools are too powerful. 
1	I like one very much, but unfortunately I just bought other ones, I just bought X200 for my sister, and I almost don’t want to give it to her. 
0	Please note that the drinking water provided by the hotel is tap water. This is what the receptionist said. So you must not drink the drinking water provided by the hotel raw. In 2008, Beijing's hotels are still at this level, which is really chilling. 
0	Pages 251 to 267 are missing, replaced with pages 239-246 and repeat. Too unhappy. It’s okay to look at the contents of the books casually, and the history books look good like this. In a word: Books that can be read but not worth collecting may refer to such books. 
1	In May 2009, the grassland was a fragile and balanced ecology-if there were no checks and balances of meatless animals, rats, rabbits, sage, and yellow sheep would all destroy the grasslands. In addition to food shortages, if there is little rain, carnivores will be extinct. The reproduction of grassland herdsmen relies on horses (to deal with wolves) and sheep (source of income), which increases the burden on the grasslands. At the same time, the increase in population reduces the number of wolves and shares water. The balance of the grassland is thus broken. In addition, the grassland environment is bad, so changing the nomadic habits is inevitable and inevitable. In the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, the ignorant accelerated this process. 
0	Very general, not as good as expected, the content is a bit superficial, nothing special, especially the part about the health preservation of Chinese medicine, a little disappointed, but the quality of the layout is still OK, the text size looks very comfortable, nothing more! 
0	The heat dissipation is not good. This argument is much better than the Thinkpad series. The VISTA installed is too slow, so you can get it. If you change the xp, it will be too slow and unbearable. 
1	In my second year of high school, I saw the Red House for the first time. I watched the whole part in a daze, remember to tell my mother after watching that Daiyu was still dead in the end. Later in the summer vacation of university, I watched it intermittently, watched it again completely, and watched it several times incompletely. Every time I look at it, I have a new feeling. And this time I saw Xiling Snow’s [Analysis of the Red Mansions], which made me love the Red Mansions even more from another level. Many of Xilingxue's views are actually something I haven't thought of, so I feel quite fresh. So I read it all in one breath. After reading it, I feel very full, just like tasting a hearty meal, which is extremely pleasant. 
1	Facing the Yalu River Bridge, with binoculars and darts, the facilities are nothing to say! Downstairs is the scenic spot! 
1	The overall price/performance ratio is very good! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
0	The hotel environment is general, but the service is extremely poor. All the managers came out to insult the tourists. They were not willing to pay for the room. They also moved politics out. The attitude was terrible. I didn’t know anything when I went to bed until 1 in the afternoon, and I clamored to pay me. I said, why didn’t I remind me that we are like this. From the manager to the staff, it’s a virtue to persuade everyone not to go. 
0	Checking in on January 7th, it was too common, for 2 stars to 1 star or no star. The service was very poor. The waiter didn't know there was a guest in the room, and opened the door to enter the room without knocking. It was frightening. What is more painful is that it is a hotel and there is no place to eat. I checked in at noon and checked out before dinner time! 
1	3799 notebook, perfect screen, good keyboard, excellent heat dissipation, fine workmanship, the genuine system is easy to use, with a wireless network card, you can roam at any time, 
0	Because it is too smooth, it is easy to leave fingerprints. Sometimes, fish and bear's paw just can't have both. Fortunately, with a piece of cloth. There is also a bit heavy, the light is not at this price. 
0	"Book a standard room: a corner room (why Ctrip booked a corner room), the room is very small, the soundproofing is very poor, the room is very cold, the air conditioning is almost not working, the bathroom is colder, and it is almost impossible to shower! Three words ""not satisfied""! "
1	The full text is generally funny. Of course, it may be because of the story. The front is better than the back. The back is entangled. The prophet is annoying. Qin Ke is not the type he likes. What characteristics are especially not independent. Although the actor is smart, the heroine is not so confused that it will be pinched in the palm of the game. People who lose their personality always give people a sense of powerlessness, but the overall feeling can be no matter what. I suggest you read less electronic files and buy more books to read paper 
0	The quality of the book is really rough, which makes people appetite. I turned the table of contents and looked at some of the content. It is really not flattering. It is a courseware handout without any vividness. In short, it is not as good as the introduction. , I have almost no interest in opening this book again~ 
0	"Have never watched this TV show. I only know that many media have said that it has high ratings and good-looking books. I bought this book for this. I have watched it one third now. To be honest, it feels average. Maybe it's because I'm used to reading works that usually take outstanding people as the protagonists. I always feel that this book does not attract me very well. Looking at the plot, I was anxious for this character, thinking ""How can he be so stupid?"" I hope the next half will surprise me. "
1	I probably read this book, first analyze the different degrees of obesity caused by people's daily bad habits from the perspective of a doctor, and then prescribe the right medicine for each cause. You have to exercise and change your eating habits and persevere to see the effect. I think every star on the screen has spent a lot of effort on the work and body maintenance in order to let the audience see their perfect side. It's really not easy. I think what they paid is something we don't know, not what they can know on the screen. 
0	I didn't want to say it at first, but Dangdang's service is really bad. This book shows that the library time is 2007-10-30 21:58:23, but today is November 12th, but I haven't received it yet. , The payment method I chose is express cash on delivery. After so long, the surface mail has arrived. Which express delivery is it? It takes 12 days. The most ironic thing is that I wrote a complaint letter, and the kf reply is to I continue to wait. The first letter I reply to is an email asking me to write some comments on this book. I am so angry, the book has not been received, what else is the comment???!!!! The service of Dangdang is really bad, After that, there is no sign. Other websites have called or sent an email to ask about it. Dangdang has nothing. Sending one in 12 days. In Dangdang, it may be normal, otherwise how can it be so long? Do you ignore the delivery time? 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
0	It is difficult to install the system. The memory is also relatively small. No CD was shipped. The built-in driver is also difficult to install. The mouse is difficult to control 
1	In the past half month, 3 girls in love pain have changed the situation after seeing the commandment and become more beautiful and more confident. There is also a problem 4 days before the engagement, and also married. It is really very effective, Although it looks clichéd, it turns out to be great! I ordered 5 more copies and emptied them in two days! In order to better answer the doubts of the lovers, I started to review it last night and summarize its Practical steps. 
0	This book is entirely based on a commercial book published after the movie became popular. The content is very incomplete. Many of Zhang's novels are collected in it, but they are all simplified. 
0	The equipment in this hotel is very old, not like a 3 star hotel. The room facilities are like 80's. 
1	Yesterday I finished reading this set of books. At the end, I didn’t like a little too much drama, but it was the best arrangement for the protagonist in the book. I have been to Xinjiang, but because the time is too short and the area of Xinjiang is a bit too broad. I didn’t go to many places. After reading this book, I had the idea of going to Xinjiang again. Because I fell in love with this handsome monk, I also looked for a few Buddhist scriptures, but I just didn’t understand. Take your time, Xiaochun continue your writing, I support you 
1	Free original package + send radiator + Rising anti-virus software; the pre-installed linux system is directly del, and then rewrite mbr, install the xp system and everything is done instantly, haha, now we are roasting chicken! 
1	Hehe, you get what you pay for, the company uses it, and the company's books are divided into different categories. These are originally for newcomers, and the configuration is similar. 
1	Many people have been emphasizing the study of the Red Mansions, but I really don’t understand why it is necessary to study it. Just like Liu Xinwu said that Qin Keqing is the daughter of the prince, I find it very funny, because he got the most basic things wrong. The twelve hairpins in Jinling, of course, are women from Jinling. It doesn't matter where they get married, or they should be called Fanguo hairpins, haha. Since she is from Jinling, if she is really the daughter of the prince, it should be from the twelve hairpins in the imperial city, not from Jinling. It's really for him to say so eloquently. 
0	Actually there are only two USBs available. The one I bought didn't even have a computer bag or a mouse. I said there was a screen saver, but I didn't find it. I bought these things myself, and the quotations are similar to other places. I didn’t install the system. It’s a lot more troublesome to install XP than other computers 
1	Cheap and affordable; better configuration; workmanship is OK; in such a cheap situation, it also has a built-in wireless network card 
1	I plan to give this book to my little niece. She is 6 years old this year. I hope she will be able to read it in two years. In fact, I want to find another book, so I remember the title of the book. New edition, two volumes, two volumes, a book more than 20 years ago, I don’t remember the author, I’m sorry, if I remember him! It’s a novel. It’s easy for children to read. However, the content of historical events and celebrity anecdotes in the Han Dynasty is extremely rich. The enjoyment at that time and the aftertaste and joy after N years, I am more I want to tell the author of the year! Thank you! 
1	The notebook is good, Jingdong is not kind enough, the diamond grabbed and the current promotional price are not much different, isn't this fooling our diamond family? ? ? 
0	This hotel is located in the Suzhou park. The location is quite far and the rooms are average. It seems that this building was not designed as a hotel, because the buildings in the park are all the same. We stayed at the hotel at night, but we passed by the door twice. I didn't find it was a hotel, and finally asked for directions and turned back. After checking out the next day, I got lost again and went around a circle to find the avenue. I think very few people usually stay in this hotel, taxis are not available, and the room rates for the two days are different, and the price on the second day is lower than the first day. Consoling yourself is a factor in the weekend. In short, the price is high, the road is far away, and the hotel is not competitive. 
0	As an executive-level member of Shangri-La Golden Circle, I feel like going home every time I stay at Shangri-La, but the series of low-level services in Zhongshan Shangri-La left me with a bad impression: 1. I booked a pick-up service at Zhuhai Airport. When I arrived at the airport exit, I didn't see the pick-up person (the first time I encountered this situation), I called the hotel to ask, and the car arrived 20 minutes later. 2. I booked the Horizon Club and checked in at the Horizon Club Executive Lounge on the 16th floor of the West Building, but arranged the room on the 6th floor of the East Building. It took more than 10 minutes to walk between. Staying in the Horizon Club is to use the lounge for convenience, why is it arranged to a far away floor, and I did not ask for my opinion. Moreover, the check-in procedure is the longest time-consuming of all Shangri-La hotels (I was the one who checked in at that time, it should take 20 minutes). The rooms are also old and smelly of smoke. I told me that it was an upgrade to a suite, but I would never accept it if I stated in advance. Moreover, the other Horizon Pavilion that was booked without upgrade was also arranged on the sixth floor of the East Building. What is it for? 3. There is a 88 yuan set meal for two for breakfast in the Chinese restaurant. I first ordered a few dim sums and asked the waiter that when my guests arrived, I would order a few more dim sums according to the set menu, so that the bill should be settled according to the 88 yuan set menu. As a result, my customer arrived, but the waiter handed him an a la carte menu, and a few other snacks were paid separately. As a result, I paid 150 yuan. Make this little money? Shangri-La has fallen! 4. Invoicing is required when checking out. If not stated in advance, two kinds of invoices will be given: one is hand-issued, and the other is fixed-rate tear-off. Why not explain it to the guests beforehand? The journey is not smooth! Shangri-La, which has always been beautiful, has fallen so badly in Zhongshan? Seriously upset! 
0	It’s not as good as imagined. The book reviews are overly boasting. The book is very large and heavy, and the pictures are very similar. It may be an early American work, which is outdated 
0	The baby is one year old and seven months old. I don't like it too much, maybe because the colors are not bright enough. And for him, it may be too simple. 
0	"I bought this book after seeing such good reviews on the Internet. I don’t think that this book is worth a look at all. To be honest, the author praised himself as a book, and I don’t know what the purpose of the previous children’s shoes was. To have such a good evaluation of this book is simply ""trust"". "
1	1. The keyboard and jacks are very friendly, and it feels better than my previous asus F81 series. 2. The red and white are distinct, and the color is beautiful; I personally prefer the logo of the metal strip, but this is a pattern 3. Copper heat dissipation? I think it is an advantage, the effect is good, the important thing is to keep the temperature inside the machine. 4. High cost performance, T6400 dual core. . . 5. There is XP driver in the random recovery disk, although it is not complete. . . The staff of JD.com actually told me no. Before the goods arrived, I was always worried about being afraid, asking people how to do it everywhere. 
0	"The hardware facilities of the hotel are relatively new, but obviously not taken care of. My friends and I lived in Japanese-style and Chinese-style rooms respectively. There was obvious dust between Tatami and the bathroom door was dropped. Because the door was broken and not repaired, it couldn't be closed gently. The lights in Chinese-style rooms flicker and dim, and the problem in the bathroom is the same. And they didn't even provide a cup for drinking water, only a cup for rinsing in the bathroom. Some of the carpets in the hallway left large dirt like oil stains. No matter how good a building is, once it is ruined and abandoned for lack of maintenance, it will not last long. In addition, the quality of service is the biggest problem. The waiters don’t know if they ask three questions. Without service and caring about consumers, they can’t answer any questions about their working environment. ‘Where did this hot spring come from? ""　'Just over there."" The waiter answered with his fingers. I, a tourist, also knows to estimate the direction of the hot spring pool. But as a hotel employee, I don’t even have the simplest knowledge of the hot spring pool. What kind of minerals are there?'　""I don't know"" 　See the management of this claimed four-star hotel. Ask them when you leave, ""Do you have many individual tourists like us?"" ""　"" is not much, we mostly accept guests from groups, conferences, and government ""　"" Do you know why there are no individual tourists? ""　The waiter is silent... The only thing that makes people feel a little better is the hot spring. But because there is no good management, the supporting service facilities are too poor and too expensive. Through the resort products set by Ctrip, I paid 618 for two persons per room including two A one-time hot spring ticket. Note: One-time means that although there is no time limit, you can only go once. That is to say, if you go at night, you cannot go the next morning, even if it is a few minutes. For money, but not happy. The hotel does not have an elevator, the corridor between the building does not have a glass roof to cover the wind and snow, and there is no awning. After soaking in the hot spring, the guests can only run back to the room coldly! The layout of their entire building! And the idea is to imitate Japanese-style hot springs, but this place just draws a ticket based on the gourd. There is no real connotation. In Japan, you pay a certain amount, and all services including food can be enjoyed, so you don’t have to worry about whether You need to pay an extra amount. People who want to take a vacation usually plan their vacation budget in advance. One spends one on the east and one spends on the west. It catches people off guard and destroys people’s mood. Just imagine how many services a person can enjoy in a few hours In short, this project is just a nondescript hot spring bathhouse with many traps and poor management by some kind of institution. If things go on like this, the time may not be too long. "
0	Two-star facilities (maybe not yet), four-star charges. I really don’t know how the four-star rating was made. It is very different from Ctrip's promotion. For example, there is a bar, which turned out to be food in the room. 
0	The hotel is aging, the room decoration is poor, and the service is too blunt. The half-day room rate will be charged for less than two hours after the noon check-out time. Other hotels basically consider humanity and do not charge this fee. 
0	It's a good hotel in Lin'an, but it's getting worse now. The room carpet is very dirty; the windows are very poorly soundproofed, and the road outside is very noisy as long as there is a car; there is no place to hang towels in the bathroom, except under the countertop; there is no free drinking water; the service at the front desk is very poor, like you Owed to her. But there are also good aspects: the last time I checked in, toll calls are free, although I hardly call them; breakfast is not expensive, and a lot of healthy food. 
0	It is not a quality problem, but a common feature of netbooks, that is, the small fonts and the long viewing time on the screen are particularly troublesome. Used to listen to music, watch movies, send emails, write things, and manage personal accounts. It's okay, but it can't be used for office work (too hurts eyes) 
0	The price/performance ratio is too poor. The room rate in a small county is higher than that of similar hotels in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. 
0	If it is not for the sake of being close to the Olympic venues, I definitely won't live here. The location is more difficult to find. Although there are only two floors and no elevator, how can people with heavy luggage get on? The corridor is so long that it can't bear it. At first, I gave a room without windows, but the place is much smaller and the price remains the same. Ctrip's price is the same as the retail price. The decoration is also relatively general, the paint on the wall is damp and falls down, looking very mottled. The bed was very uncomfortable, the spring was really awkward, it was uncomfortable to sleep on it, and the quilt was very thin, not like a blanket or cotton tire. 
0	This hotel is suspected of deception: ctrip shows that the executive room has free internet access, but it is not the case. It is free only when you go to the executive lounge. The internet access in the room is charged at 2 yuan per minute, and if you go to the executive lounge, you must You can activate your account online first in the room. In other words, you have to spend at least two yuan to get online, and you are no longer in the room. This is not a deception. If I knew that, I wouldn't settle here for more than 1,400 room rates. Living there is no better than here. I just want to go online. Other services are really average. It is far away from the city and it is very inconvenient to travel. There are few facilities around, there are more hotels in the city at the same price, and I will not live next time, and the breakfast is really average. The check-in speed is slow, and if a foreigner asks a question, I just let go of the check-in with me and go to take care of others. This makes people feel very bad. Check out is also a drag. 
0	Too bad, it does not reach the 5-star standard at all. The rooms have been renovated for a long time, and the tables are all broken. The only thing is that the environment in the hotel is okay, and the standard room is too bad. Ctrip is looking for talents to act as an agent for cooperative advertising business.

0	The appearance is ordinary, the materials are average, and the major shortcomings The wireless network card is 802.11a/g/n, but it is actually ABG 
0	The built-in vista system was not satisfied, and the XP system was changed, and the pci simple communication controller driver could not be installed. I hope that Jingdong technical customer service can give us a complete modification of the XP system. 
0	Such a large hard disk is actually divided into only one zone, the heating control is general, the sound of the speaker feels a little bit smaller, and it seems that the Bluetooth function is not available. The 16:9 screen ratio is still adapting. 
1	The hotel is very clean and the service is good, so I decided to come again tonight. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you for choosing the Ambassador Hotel for many times and for your recognition of the hotel. We will as always, with quality service and warm smile looking forward to your coming again! 
0	I have never stayed in an InterContinental hotel with such poor service. I checked in 3/10. I was told that the free laundry on Ctrip had been cancelled when I checked in at the front desk. I asked to reconfirm it for a long time before saying that there is a reservation (I feel that there will be a problem. Sure enough, it happened at the time of the account), and the drink coupon was only given after reminding. There is a smell of decorating paint on the floor (10th floor). The room is very small. It feels no more than 30 square meters. After 11 o'clock in the evening, the welcome fruit has not been delivered (I feel that this Intercontinental is all links can be saved). Halfway through the bath the next night, I heard the water pipe tremble. The next thing I released was rusty water. I rushed to find a towel to dry, but there were no towels in the bathroom, and there were no two. I had to use a towel to dry, call, wait 15 minutes for workers to come up for inspection (there were countless times during this period), the solution was to continue to drain the water for 5 minutes, saying that it was ready to wash, and I did not see any hotel managers. Come up to express any apologies. The colleague expressed objection to the bill during the checkout-after receiving the laundry fee that should be free, the front desk swiped his card before signing the bill, and then the free internet fee was charged again. Negotiation with the deputy manager in the lobby The result was to let me contact Ctrip myself. I connected to Ctrip with my mobile phone and gave the mobile phone to the assistant manager. She called there for 5 minutes before agreeing to refund. (There is no welcome fruit at my colleague). I told the assistant manager about the bathroom last night and promised to reply as soon as possible. No response has been received yet. Before coming to Shenyang, I knew the service of the North, so I booked the InterContinental Hotel on the Internet. I originally expected the international brand hotel chain to be satisfied with the other InterContinental I have stayed at. I didn't expect to encounter this kind of experience in this InterContinental hotel. I am very disappointed with this InterContinental Hotel and will warn other colleagues who go to Shenyang not to live there! I am responsible for the above statement, my PRIORITY # 271 153 317 
0	The mirrored screen is good, but if the frame is mirrored, it is easy to fray. When the screen frame is buckled down, it will rub against the corresponding position of the notebook. 
1	Andrei and I are about the same age. Although the environment in which we grew up is very different, I still have some resonance with the dialogue in this book. I like this book very much, and there is a strong affection running through it. I think of my parents and me and my parents. When I was young, my parents accompanied me on shopping, helping me choose clothes, bags, shoes... Later, I just let them accompany me, but rarely listen to their opinions. Later, I forgot the feeling of shopping with them. Now, because it’s been too long, too long, and I haven’t had such an experience! 
1	I got the thing in the morning. It looks the same as the other sl400 I bought before, but it is a bit slower than it. I don't know if the quality is good or not. Now I haven't found the problem. It's okay. Now I have used it for a long time and I haven't found the problem, just slower 
1	It is well-known. As soon as you talk about the eleven routes of a taxi at the airport, just ask Home. But Tianjin Airport is basically black cars. It's less than 30 minutes from the hotel to the airport, and the airport actually hits more than 50. 
0	The built-in system is not XP, and it is a bit annoying to use. I plan to borrow an external CD-ROM drive to reinstall the system in two days. 
0	The price/performance ratio is too bad! Severely does not meet the so-called 4-star standard, the surrounding air is poor, and the most troublesome air-conditioning system is mixed with heavy smoke, and it is impossible to survive without opening the window. 
1	The location is good, the room is big in Hong Kong, especially the bathroom is large, and the hardware is relatively old. Living here is just a convenience. It's just that the timing is wrong this time, and the price is probably not as expensive as usual 2- 3 times. Normally, more than 2000 
0	"2008, July, 19, Changsha International Trade Center Fright Night. My colleague and I went out for more than an hour after we checked in. The two rooms were easily opened by a stranger through the receptionist ""inviting"" the waiter without authorization, and valuable properties (computers, etc.) were stolen. The police were called 110, and there were surveillance videos and transcripts as evidence. I believe that the people's police can kill the people. China World Hotel ""leads the wolf into the room"" and neglects its duty. So far, there is no attitude or action to apologize or compensate for losses. But can the truth fall? See you at the court. The only evaluation: ""black shop"". CTRIP should also reflect. Hotel feedback August 6, 2008: After the incident, the hotel immediately reported to the police. According to the information currently available, there are several doubts about the incident. The public security department is currently actively investigating the incident, and the hotel will be responsible for it on August 5 Police officer Wang communicated this matter.Although we can understand the mood of the guests, the facts are different from those expressed above.All monitoring data and transcripts record objective facts, and the hotel will continue to follow this matter. "
1	The hotel room is not bad, the big bed is very comfortable. I slept soundly at night, but the computer provided in the room was not available, and the lobby environment was less than the four-star standard, but it was a bit higher than the Samsung. Additional comments July 20, 2008: The hotel room is not bad, the big bed is very comfortable. I slept soundly at night, but the computer provided in the room was unusable. The hotel environment was less than the four-star standard, but it was a bit higher than the Samsung. 
0	The screen looks a bit small, ha ha! The acoustics were not as good as expected. The price changes too fast! 
1	"Through the description of the relationship and fate of Hannah and Misha, the novel alludes to the life experiences of Germans who have experienced war and Germans born after the war. A sentence in the book ""I love Hannah's suffering is to a certain extent the fate of our generation, the fate of the Germans"". It better interprets the contradictory mentality, love-hate entanglement, lack and return of human morality and justice, and the helplessness in post-war German society. "
1	After reading the whole story, the emotion in the story feels depressing, and I can’t let it go for a long time. I think it is the character of the author that made her create such a unique book. The author’s perception and understanding of life are all contained. In this book, I sometimes imagine the author’s life, what should it be like? If she were more happy, positive, and optimistic, she would not have passed away so early, but if she had such a happy, positive, and optimistic character, perhaps, there would be absolutely no Wuthering Heights book. She is like a panic. Bloom all the splendor in that moment 
1	I was on a business trip in Shenyang. I had bought one before. This time I bought one for a friend. It has improved performance and configuration, but the price has dropped. There are two main areas for improvement: 1. , N270 increased to N280, the capacity of the six-cell lithium battery increased from 4400 mA to 5200 mA, it is worth buying, I used it for two months, everything is very good! 
0	I really took the courier. I started to send YTO, and then transferred to EMS. No one told me. After the EMS was delivered, they said that they should sign and inspect the goods. I can’t inspect the goods without signing! I also said that if you don't sign, you can return the things! Really dizzy! There is also a discrepancy with the parameters, no camera, it seems that there is no Bluetooth, right? 
0	Point: The quality of ACER international brand is reassuring, and the workmanship is very good. Super cost-effective: ACER international brand quality is reassuring, and the workmanship is very good. Super cost-effective 
1	That mysterious history, that long-standing culture, and that legend about deepening, is hidden in the Salisbury Plain, hidden on the old buildings, and it is popular to roam and ride on the Alps. On the gorgeous and young faces of the witches on the broomstick... Swimming as much as possible is what we enjoy in this book. There is a legend in my heart, slowly, slowly, under the guidance of this book, long and long, immortal. This is a symbol, this is civilization, this is human thinking, he thought... 
0	Old hotel, the facilities are very old and simple, I only stayed for one night so it will be done; the traffic is quite convenient, the room overall feels a bit dirty, it should be because of the old reason. Next time I will change to another one, I don’t want to live , There is nothing to miss. There is no network cable. 
1	Overall very good. The location is not as good as expected. Although it is also listed near Lujiazui. Although the service staff said it is very close to Zhengda Plaza. But it is still very different. Overall it is still very good, compared to other Hotel experience. 
0	The heat dissipation is too poor, and the fuselage gets hot after less than half an hour each time it is turned on. If it runs other software or reads the optical drive, it will shut down directly. I don’t know if it’s a problem with this machine or an individual phenomenon. I’m currently applying for a replacement. I hope to deal with it as soon as possible. Otherwise, it’s impossible to work. 
0	I was worried about the northern reservation for my friend on the 29th. Unexpectedly, when the room closed on the 30th, the front desk asked my friend’s room that the cable TV remote control was missing. Later, at my strong request, the hotel staff might use Baidu to search for the remote control. Just stop! I wondered: Why am I so unlucky? Every time I make a reservation in the north, there will be trouble. I think this is not accidental. The front desk service in the north really needs to be improved. 
1	To be honest, the four books by the author are all good. I have basically read these nine key technologies. I am in the stage of repurchase. The contents of the book are easy to understand, and the price is very reasonable. , I have also purchased the other three books, and I have read them very carefully. Here I want to say: Teacher Zhao, you have worked hard, the book is really great! The articles are very exciting! ~~ In addition, I would like to say, I look forward to your next work, I hope you can publish a function book, then remember to inform me, I will buy it, and I will definitely look at it with my heart, let me say: You have worked hard, Looking forward to your next masterpiece!~~? 
1	It does have the characteristics of a business hotel, but it lacks thoughtful five-star service. 
1	My English is not bad. I heard that this book is pretty good before I plan to buy it. But still don't worry, I went to the bookstore and took a look. I wanted to buy all three books together, but the first one—the elementary course—is too simple for someone with English level like me, so I just bought the second one. A very good book. If you have passed Level 4 or even Level 3, you can start learning English grammar from this book, and the content in it is also very practical. I really like this book! 
0	I don’t know what I have said. It is concluded from the case that Koreans have such logical reasoning ability. You should save money and buy some more useful books, believe me 
1	The one-and-a-half-year-old daughter likes the image of little bear very much, so she bought this set of books after buying Crackling. The two sets are of the same author, but the styles are completely different. I think this set of books is very suitable for little babies. White background , The cute animal images, and the little stories told are familiar to children and easy to understand. I let my baby choose the book she likes every night, and then tell her on the bed. She likes listening very much. As a memorial for this stage of the child, collect this set of books and keep it for her baby. 
0	I stayed for one night during the Spring Festival, and entering the door was like arriving at a big market. It was almost 12:00 in the evening, and there was still a lot of people, and it felt very noisy. After entering the room, it felt okay, but the bathroom was very poor, and the shower had no door. One room of water. The overall feeling is 3 star standard. I changed to Shangri-La on the second day. I will never go again! 
1	Beautiful, very suitable for girls. The system is not difficult to install. As long as you use XP SP3, you can install it. SP2 does not have a SATA hard drive. 
0	Reading a good book can see the soul of the author, but Yu Dan's book does not, it is general, not worth reading, not worth buying. 
1	The workmanship of thinkpad is still ok, especially some classic things are well passed down 
1	"I bought it for a colleague and gave it to her as soon as it arrived. As soon as she went to work in the afternoon, she happily said: ""The child likes this set of books very much. When she said that, I was also very happy, a little moved, thinking about whether to buy a set for my child. The colleague’s child is in the second grade of elementary school and is seven years old. My family used to buy some books such as ""One Hundred Thousand Whys for Children, and Views on Children's Science"". Now that the child is almost ten years old, I would like to see if this set of books is too good. "

0	"I really don't know what kind of people the audience is aimed at. Does this kind of boring novel with boring writing and content satisfy the eccentricity of looking up to the small staff outside the Fortune 500 circle, or does it deceive the fresh talents who have never stepped into the society to figure out the situation and become so popular? After reading dozens of pages, I can’t turn it down, full of pretentious plot settings and dialogues, a book that will become an idiot after a long time. To take a TV drama as an example, Cao Ying’s version of ""The Pretty Lady in Law"" can be compared with it~ I feel sooooo sick..... "
0	When I opened the book, I was attracted and read it in one go. The more I read the book, the more complicated it became. It is difficult to imagine the complexity of the company when I first entered the society. Of course, as a female reader, Lala's love affair has always affected my mood, and in the end it was a good ending. I am ready to buy the second book. The book review is not as good as the first one, but I still want to read it. Maybe we have too high expectations for Lala. 
1	The location is very convenient, that is, it is close to the train station, which is a bit noisy. The configuration of the room can be seen in the past, it is almost better than four stars, and better than three stars. The highlight is that the bathroom has a tap that can be directly consumed. 
0	When I bought it, I read the reviews and said it was good, but only after I bought it, I didn’t show it to my child. I think she might not like it. 
1	I stayed in Building 5 for 3 days and I felt pretty good. Both the guest rooms and the staff in the catering department can give guests a sincere smile. The transportation is convenient near the hotel and not far from the city center and various scenic spots. Will come next time live. 
1	Reading the preface of this book makes people feel that more than 30 and 40 unhappy women are over in this life. Just as the author himself had been confused in his 20s, but fortunately he had an epiphany at the age of 30. But there are still a large number of women after the age of 30, when she understands these principles, they can only regret it late; and there are a large number of women who do not understand these principles after an unhappy life, and only feel that this is what they are supposed to do. What to do and how to do, I suggest that more than 40 and 50 seniors give this book again. How unhappy women in their 30s can change the destiny of life, I am sure there must be more and more readers. 
0	The manual is simple and the software that comes with the disk does not specify what to use. You don’t know when you install it. If you don’t install it, some shortcut keys won’t work. If you install it, you don’t know which one is. In addition, the keyboard feels bad. 
1	It is of great significance for understanding Chinese ancient craftsmanship. It was discovered that the ancients attached great importance to the accumulation of experience, and have already had subtle solutions to many technological problems. But at the same time, it was also discovered that the ancients mostly ignored the safety and environmental issues in the process, such as refining various things with mercury and gilding. This operation will save you 20 years of life. There is no ventilation at all in the coal mining pit, and the mortality rate should also be quite high. It is not unreasonable that the ancient kings emphasized agriculture and light industry, because agriculture is indeed a safer occupation compared to craftsmanship. 
0	The quality of the hardware is not good, the old black screen, now the hard disk is not found, just today is the seventh day of signing! 
0	I checked in on March 6th. I checked the reviews of other hotels from netizens at that time. They were not very good. I chose this hotel because there were no reviews yet. But it turned out to be very bad, not four stars at all, there were cockroaches in the closet in the room, and I shot one dead on the spot. 298 yuan/night is definitely not worth it. Compared with Chengdu, the price is the same. The service and equipment are too far apart. I won't live there next time. If possible, it is best to go back to Chengdu to live. The Mianyang-Chengdu drive only takes 1 hour and 45 minutes. 
0	I have evaluated this book before. It turned out that I bought two sets because of a hand error. My money~~~ So, evaluate again! I really regret buying this set of books, especially, I actually bought two sets. The intestines are all regretful. When I bought so many books, I also picked them with high reputation and high level. It can be seen that it is difficult to tune in, and a good reputation may not please everyone. This story is the least logical in traversal that I have seen. . 
1	When Twilight began to read it, I felt that it was not as good as other magical novels. Maybe it was because of the translation. I always felt a little stiff in terms of turnover. However, when I looked at it later, I felt that it became more and more attractive, and then reached the level of crazy obsession. How to say it, this book gives people the feeling that the emotions it describes are very real, although the story is not real, the emotions are moving, and the plot is very good, well, although this book has Western magic The consistent feature of the book is to stimulate it at the end of each book, just like the Harry Potter series, ha ha~~ 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, the keyboard is also very comfortable to use, and the colors are also very nice! There are many functions too! ! I have used fingerprint recognition, and it's great! No bright spots, scratches. 
1	The appearance is very impressive, I think it is a classic business style, the configuration is average, but I can still accept the price. 
1	1 The wrist rest part under the keyboard does not have its own system, only Intel NVIDIA nba three labels are clean and simple. 2 There are fine raised dots on the touch panel, which is more comfortable to use. 3 The configuration is very good. At least so far, the 4 nba version is more personal. 5 does not have its own Microsoft system to save money 
0	1. I found a bright spot. Does this batch of machines have bright spots? It's an eyesore. 2. The third-party delivery speed is so slow. 3. Piano paint is too unusable, easy to flower, fingerprint collector. 4. If you are not used to Vista, you have to install XP system yourself, which is troublesome. 
0	Very bad, the decoration of the room is too old, just like the feeling of the 90s. The so-called deluxe standard room of 168, can only be said to be an ordinary standard room, my husband sleeps 
1	The book itself is good. Although it is a short travel note, it feels like a small prose, which makes people relax. Wake up early on the weekend and sit on the balcony to read one or two articles. It feels especially good, and it can give people a rest. The disadvantage is that no matter what town, the number of characters is almost the same. It seems that the number of characters has been set to write. Some good places feel that they have not been specifically stated in place, and they feel like Ximo. Also, although each article has one or two pictures, it is better to have matching pictures to match the characteristics of the text. 
0	Why doesn’t it show up on the page when it’s out of stock? What else can people buy? Isn't this a lie! At the very least, respect for customers should show that they are temporarily out of stock. Don't make people waste their efforts. 
1	I booked the family room and stayed at the Hongkou Business Hotel. Because I changed the order after arrival, I had some unpleasantness with the lady at the front desk, but the room service and the value-for-money staying in the room greatly made up for the previous discomfort. In general, not bad 
1	The workmanship of the machine is still very good, and I didn’t see any difference from the company’s T60. Of course, the materials used are still different. 
0	I ordered 4 pieces and only received 1 piece without any explanation. I called to inquire, just one sentence, out of stock, and the webpage was not updated in time. If you want to buy, place another order. Ha, I really got it right. From the order to the receipt of the item, the webpage was not updated for half a month. I don't know what the speed is. This is my first time shopping in Dangdang, and probably the last time. 
1	I don’t know if this book is abridged or a large number of abridgements. If that is the case, it would be a shame. 
1	Recommend this book to all parents and children, in fact, everyone, because even if it is not the parent of the child, it is also the child of the parent 
0	It feels that the workmanship, materials, etc. have regressed from the previous IBM era! Of course it’s not 360! 
1	"The book Dangdang is out of stock. I borrowed it from the library. It feels more difficult to understand, not as good as ""Dark Consciousness and Democratic Tradition"", but of course it has its readability as an academic paper, but my degree is not enough. I always thought that I would be able to read and understand papers and appreciate the author's thoughts and philosophies when I went to university, but it seems that it is still early. For those who are going to buy this book, I would like to say that since you have already bought this book, you must read it carefully and don't give it up halfway. This book is a study of Confucian culture through Liang Qichao. "
1	"This book is a groundbreaking introductory work with comprehensive content. Many of them have been translated and introduced to China for the first time and are worth reading. If you compare it with the compiler, Dr. Zhang Changjun's other book ""Research on American Intelligence Failure"", you will benefit more from reading it. I recommend these two rare and serious books in China. The problem is that this book still has many obvious proofreading mistakes. If there is a chance to reprint it, it should be revised. In addition, related research fields seem to be of little concern. However, I think this research topic is very important, and I hope more scholars can participate. "
0	The computer that was sent has an old look on the label. It may be a long time ago, otherwise it won’t be like this. Other good 
1	"I bought the second set this time. I bought it for a friend. In general, I think it is very cost-effective. My daughter is 20 months old. I was the first set she bought when she was 14 months old. The good habits in it are basically ignored. She likes every little animal in the book, so she is more willing to imitate it. Later, she bought a set of ""Apollin Little World"", but she and Ben did not like the latecomers. I also think the latter ""Apollin Little"" World>Not as clear as the former. I understand that Baby Bear's picture books are more worth buying and learning. If parents want to buy two sets, it is recommended to buy a bear picture book. "
1	The location is very good, it takes only 5 minutes to walk to the Confucian Temple and Qingliang Temple. There are many nearby buses and it is very convenient, but taxis are not very popular (the old city road is narrow and traffic jams). Because it is an old hotel, the facilities should be outdated. 
1	The appearance is relatively beautiful, the screen is very beautiful, hehe, I have to mention it, a brand new machine, a perfect screen, the hard disk power-on time is 43 hours, the viewing angle color is good, and the price of this configuration is high, which saves you The money is ready to upgrade the memory and hard disk, ha ha worth buying. In addition, installing XP is not so laborious. Set the hard disk to IDE mode in the BIOS, and then divide it into zones to install it. I use the deep fast installation version. The XP driver can be downloaded from the official website of Dairy Cow. . 
0	Very general, not in recent years. The aesthetics are also temporal, and the colors and expressions are not as good as the works of recent years. 
0	Very bad, I will definitely not stay next time, I strongly recommend you not to stay in this hotel! It is said that it was built according to the five-star standard, and even the standard of Samsung has not been reached! Fake five stars, not listed! I asked the front desk about the renovation of the swimming pool, so I can't participate in star rating. I guess I dare not! I stayed in room 1505. 1. The room facilities are very old, and a lot of paint has fallen off the tables and chairs; 2. There are rusty spots around the bathroom mirror; 3. The shower in the bathroom has fallen down during the shower; 4. The noise when the air conditioner is adjusted to low temperature makes sleeping No; 5. There is only one male waiter at the front desk, saying that he is alone on duty after get off work, and the service is very average; 5. The front desk actually charges a piece of insurance at the checkout (not indicated on Ctrip, and the waiter did not explain in advance). ...The only thing I've been there is that the attitude of the concierge is OK. The hardware is poor, and the software is useless. The next morning, I moved to the four-star Post (POST). If it weren't for the plane to arrive late at midnight, we would have turned around that night. It is recommended that Ctrip not hit five stars in front of this hotel! 
1	The room mentioned on the Internet is 24 square meters, which is actually not that big. In addition, the air conditioning in the room is not very cool! 
0	Shopping is more convenient, the Bund is also near, but the room is too small. No breakfast inconvenient, noisy, older decoration 
1	Particularly thin and portable, matte feel, very comfortable full-size keyboard, rich functions and interfaces. 
1	After reading these 3 books, the first two are not bad, but the ending is not ideal. Especially after reading the two novels, I don’t know if Si elder brother likes Nian Yuying before or after crossing. Moreover, the emotional part in this book is very unclear. Generally speaking, the author’s writing is still Yes, the language is full of humor, but it may be that the sense of humor is more than the emotional shaping of the characters, which turns the romance into a story-telling novel. And I don’t like the male and female protagonists. I don’t see that they like each other and their desire is greater than love. After reading it, there is nothing to remember. 
0	After reading a few pages, there is no desire to read it. The author has been bragging. After a while, Mrs. So and so has been unable to cure any disease. After he took a look, he took a few medicines, or pressed a few times, and it was cured immediately. Either the doctor has been unable to cure any disease and ask him for help. Regarding the real thing, there is no detailed explanation at all. Bad book~ 
1	I went to Wuhu to have a wedding wine for my nephew, 10 people, booked 5 standard rooms on the 24th to 26th. I read the reviews before staying, and I had lingering fears. After I lived, I felt better than expected. In such a city, the price should be more than Not bad. Disadvantages, living on the 4th floor, there is a large platform in front of the window, and the view outside the window is not good. I love photography, but I am a little sorry. 
1	It's not bad in Taiyuan, personally think it is better than Shanxi Hotel! I have never lived in China World Trade Center, the price is too expensive, ha ha 
0	Very disappointed. But it is also normal, because the price is such accommodation conditions in Beijing. The building of the hotel seems to be connected to the business building. 4 elevators are separated by a wall, 2 business buildings and 2 accommodations. There is no feeling of enjoyment in the room, so I just stayed for one day. There are no restaurants and supermarkets nearby, which is not very convenient. 
1	The heat is too big, and the weight is not well controlled. It's not bad to buy this configuration for less than 5,000. The design of the new mold is much more beautiful. It is more beautiful than the T series, and the sound quality is improved a lot. Unlike the T series, it is just a broken gong. 
1	Very average, not very competitive~ I got a business big bed room with a computer, ha ha, I paid 209 yuan for nothing, which is the same as no discount~ It's still relatively quiet~ Others are very average, the TV is crazy small, estimated 21 Inch, I can’t see what’s on the TV~ Poor~ The hotel feedback July 9, 2008: At present, we have applied to the company to replace the TV. For the convenience of our guests, we have added some computer rooms at a charge of 20 yuan. 
1	The service staff of the hotel are attentive and meticulous, giving people a feeling of being at home. 
0	"My family took our children to the ""May 1st"", and we selected the hotel that we selected on the Xiecheng website for a long time, but it still seems wrong. 1. The hotel has nothing to do with the layout of large rooms and suites. It was originally not designed for hotels, but the furniture inside is backward and outdated than the hotel-style apartments in Beijing and Shanghai. 2. From entering the reception hall (cannot be called the lobby), there is a smell in the aisles and rooms. You can imagine the smell of smoke, sweat, and musty that can't escape together. The building is completely enclosed and does not have a window for ventilation. It depends on central air conditioning for ventilation. This is the problem. The shop told us that the hot and cold wind is not only natural wind on the night we stayed. It is strongly recommended to ask for clearance before booking. , Can't sleep hot at night. 3. Bath towels and towels are really dirty and old. Samsung is not as good as Samsung. Especially the newly replaced pillowcases have a smell. I thought the waiter did not change and asked for a replacement, but the result is still the same. It seems that there is a problem with the laundry room. 4 The swimming pool is an important reason for us to choose him, because the children are learning to swim. The small pool of 25 meters by 10 meters obviously has no water filtration system, or it is not open. The water is quite mixed. The tourists are all local guests. There is no supplies in the shower room except for the tap. It is recommended that guests do not consider 5. The restaurant did not try, (Xiecheng always corrupts our breakfast. I almost never eat free breakfast in the room booked by Xiecheng) so there is no comment 6. Only It is commendable that the service staff responded quickly, and they can come to explain immediately if there is a complaint. All they can do is explain, and they can't solve the hardware problem. "
1	"Do you know that there is such a cow? He doesn't like horns, planing, running or jumping. What he likes is to sit quietly under the oak tree and smell the flowers quietly. His name is Ferdinand. His mother was worried at first. Will Ferdinand be lonely if he always stays alone? But when Ferdinand told her mother that she would be happy to stay and smell the flowers quietly like this, her good mother who understood ""cow"" walked away with confidence and let her son live according to his wishes. At the end of the book, it reads: He has a very happy life. I really like this cow, and I really like his mother who understands ""cow"". "
1	Dongdong is not bad. When reinstalling the system, I cannot find out how to modify the BIOS before installing? Please help solve the problem! 
0	The heat dissipation is a bit different than I expected, the temperature at the keyboard is not high, and the heat in the chassis is larger. I don't know what will happen in summer. If you buy it a few days later, you may buy e43g, the graphics card is not very useful. 
0	Definitely a hotel of nothing. Checked in on the evening of April 30. When the outdoor temperature was 30 degrees, the room did not have air conditioning. When we made our opinion, we actually said that we were afraid that the guests would catch cold? ! ! What we are covering is a duvet! After repeated requests, I brought an electric fan to fool us... the cafeteria the next morning was the same stuffy. The so-called 4-star hotel is not willing to even turn on the air conditioner? This hotel will probably never stay again. 
0	The price is a bit higher (although I bought it, I always feel that the difference with the market is getting smaller and less, and there is no advantage); the vista system is slow; there is no camera; it is difficult to install the memory; the right side of the screen is not tight after the screen is closed, a Dangdang; at this price, there is no random mouse given; the partition is unreasonable; 
0	At first, I was going to book Hyatt, but the assistant made a mistake and booked Grand Hyatt. Simply evaluate the following. The counter service attitude is okay, but the room is very small. The most dissatisfied is the hotel fleet. At first I reserved a Toyota Crown, and then when I wanted to use the car, the counter told me that the Crown car was out, only Corolla, and then told me the price was 450 yuan, so I had to book it. After a while, the Corolla driver came over and said that the price was 550 yuan, and immediately raised the price. I think this is not a question of money, but a credit issue of the hotel. At noon, I was going to eat and asked the driver to pick me up at 12:30, but he did not show up until 12:30. I can only call Grand Hyatt. The most unbearable thing is that the driver kept on the phone while driving. I used the car for more than 5 hours that day, and the driver was on the phone for more than 3 hours. If you want to use a car when you stay in Grand Hyatt, don't use a Grand Hyatt car. Very poor quality. 
0	When I got the book, I turned it around and found that the book suddenly jumped from page 154 to page 186 and the words were all upside down...Then it went from page 186 to page 155...The back was normal. ,,,...Looks so inconvenient...affects mood 
1	Ole Umbrella... a place where stuttering is eliminated... a bohemian bazaar hungry for creativity... a transposition game about love and understanding. At the age of six, Tang Youyou began to stutter, which made him feel inferior and lonely. He came under the Ole umbrella and stammered a wish to be an elf, so Xia Duo had to bite the bullet and go to be an elementary school student for him for three days... I really like the world of the dream god Ole Umbrella, and he put 6 full books in one go. Read it all. There is everything here, but there is no boring! I hope I can always have a childlike innocence, and always travel in the world of the dream god Olie Umbrella! 
0	"I bought several sets of the book of traversal. I saw the review of ""Man Man Qing Luo"" on Dangdang.com and bought it and read it. After reading the article, it was really disappointing. The writing was not so vivid and it felt too simplistic. On the contrary, I prefer the book ""Scary Step by Step"", which is also through o(∩_∩)o... "
0	After installing the hp541 series driver downloaded on the website before, after installation, everything is OK, the speed is very fast, next time I will buy one on Jingdong, praise 
0	It is quite troublesome to install the system, and the driver is not easy to find. The cooling vent is on the left hand side. The cooling vent will be hot, but the hand rest and the keyboard will not be hot. When the CD-ROM drive is running, it vibrates too much, putting it on the leg like a massager! 
1	The computer is beautiful and the performance is good. The computer is beautiful and the performance is good. The computer is beautiful and the performance is good. 
0	The mini room is really a mini... The furniture and wallpaper are old, but they are all complete. Although the place is still hard to find, it is quite convenient to call a taxi. The room is very poorly soundproofed. In short, I'm sorry for the price, it's better to go to Home Inn. 
1	After I bought it, I thought it was nothing special, but my son thought it was funny when I was surprised. I asked my son what would the hungry snake do when he saw an apple tree? He said that he would climb up the tree and eat the apples before coming down, but as soon as he turned to the back he burst into laughter and said that the little snake was a fool! There are also the front and back pages of the book. Every time he reads this book, he has to count the trees on the front and back pages. When he counts an apple tree on the back page, he laughs again. Repeatedly counting and laughing, my son can really feel his innocence and cuteness when reading this book! A book worth reading again! 
0	The shell of piano lacquer is easy to get dirty. It is recommended that you use a film to protect it. There are many thinkpad special films on the market. The effect of the sticker is exactly the same as the matte surface of the t series. 
0	The Korean teacher is just a gimmick, really useless for memorizing words. But the paper and printing are good, of course, this is also within the cost. 
0	After reading 1/3 of the content, I feel that they are all excerpts from other books. There is no talk about my own beauty experience, and I am more suspicious of making money. 
1	The lobby of the hotel is very large, very grand, and the service is good. We arrived at about 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. The front desk staff was still very enthusiastic and fast. The room facilities are very good. Under our window is the hotel restaurant, waiter Still prompted to close the window at night, I don’t know why, is it really that unsafe? We followed the advice... 
0	You need to install the system yourself, and the layman may have problems, so be mentally prepared to ask someone to help install it! 
0	That is, the battery time is a bit short, showing 2 hours, but when it can be within 30 minutes, you basically have to plug in the power source, or you are afraid of sudden power failure. I don't even give a bag, I have to buy it myself, ha ha. 
0	The Worse hotel in Chengdu right now, check out at 12.30pm and they want you to pay extra half day room charges, the room key are program till 11am and you cannot open the room door after 11am though they put check out 12pm.Those staff working at the front desk are the worse atittude I encountered. Please think again if you want to stay in this hotel. Check out at 12:30 will add half a day's room charge, the front desk attitude is very poor, you can't open the room until eleven If you have another choice, don’t stay in this hotel. Feedback June 1, 2008: Dear guest; Hello! Thank you for staying at Chengdu Xinliang Hotel! The hotel attaches great importance to your questions and has been strengthened The staff’s professional training is provided. At the same time, the hotel also apologizes for all the inconvenience caused during your stay. The hotel sincerely invites you to stay in the hotel again, thank you for your advice! 
1	Others are good, breakfast is average. Hotel facilities are not as good as those of Sheraton in other cities. Hotel Feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay at this hotel! Recently, the newly appointed Singaporean executive chef of the hotel is improving the dishes based on guest feedback. At the same time, there are also many new catering promotion activities recently. I believe the next experience will definitely not disappoint you. Welcome to stay again, and sincerely wish you good health and smooth work! 
0	They really dare to hang the four-star brand! Beijing hotels have always been like this, expensive and poor! The one in the room is called hot, and the air conditioner does not work at all. I called room service and said that there is only natural wind, not cold wind! What kind of natural wind is it, obviously much higher than the outdoor temperature. Finally, their suggestion to me is to open the windows of the room. In that ghost climate in Beijing, poplar saplings are floating outside. Can they be opened! I won’t mention breakfast, just order something, Western-style food is terribly unpalatable, and Chinese food is not much better. Also, the phone in the hotel is simply charged! There is no long-distance price list in the room, and the service guide is just a few copies of A4 paper. When I checked out, I made a checklist. The domestic long-distance distance is almost 80 cents per minute, and the mobile 12591 is only 0.39/min, a black shop! I won't be killed next time! 
1	After reading it twice, on a gloomy day, I ran to the Qingyunpu Bada Shanren Memorial Hall, looking for the footprints of the Shanren’s life, in the quiet path of the bamboo forest, in front of his grave, in his cold eyes I stopped for a long time before seeing the paintings of the world, and refused to leave. 
1	In today's society, because of the pressure of work, we young people have found an excuse not to honor their parents from the trivial matters of life. In fact, throughout the ages, no great man is not a big filial son, because filial piety is the first. Filial piety is fundamental. It is better to keep filial piety in your heart Put it into daily life. My dad is an old doctor. His words tell the current social phenomenon. Only the parents who accompany their children to see the doctor do not accompany the elderly to the hospital. Yes, it is chilling, no parents can have us. This book has awakened all people who have filial piety but don't have time to implement it. Filial piety cannot wait. Let's start now. 
0	"Before school started, I bought a set for my niece (I'm five years old, I can read some books), and now it’s winter vacation, I asked her if the book is good, and she said: ""There are too few words to read, not good "". Seeing her dismissive look, I know that I should not blindly believe the online sales rankings. "
1	Things are okay, perfect screen, heat dissipation is slightly different than the little black I bought before, but considering the larger price difference, I won’t say anything. 
0	This hotel is really bad~ I still live in an executive room, the air conditioner leaks, the sound is very loud, the carpet is dirty, the furniture is very old and there are mosquitoes, but the housekeeping department wants mosquito coils. 
0	The edge of the notebook is a little unsightly, a little raised. It should be because I didn't pay attention to the production, it should be my bad luck! Case, but I complained that I did not want to exchange the goods, but no one answered. I am also very happy that someone can comfort me or give me a small gift! However, complaints cannot be displayed and answered. I hope Jingdong can improve on this! 
1	The basic configuration is not bad, and the noise is quite small. No dead pixels have been found on the screen for the time being (detected with professional software) 
1	I booked the China Coal online and stayed at the hotel for 3 days from August 22 to August 25, 2007. I feel that the price of 240 per day in a 3-star hotel in Qinhuangdao during the tourist season is very good value for money. The buffet of 15 yuan per person every day is quite good, clean and sanitary, and the accommodation environment is very good, although it is not relevant The tourist attractions are far away, but the transportation is still convenient. It is convenient to go out and do the 9th bus and 4 stops to the railway station, and the train schedule is very fast 1 to 2 minutes to wait for the train, the price is very advantageous. It is also very convenient to go to other scenic spots from No. 9 to Sidaoqiao. The service staff at the front desk are friendly. 
1	It's still a very practical book, but the materials in the book are sold in a lot of quantities. In fact, there are very few used in cosmetics, and there are quite expensive ones that are not worth it. There are still many simple things. I especially like them. Red wine blush is very simple and practical. I like it very much. It is very similar to the more popular benefit liquid blush. The color is very beautiful. If the blush made by yourself has a fragrance, it will be used in the blush later. Just drop a few drops of the essential oil you like. Thank you Mr. Niuer~ There are also several masks and lipsticks, which are great! The effect is not worse than that of selling outside, and it is very cheap. 
1	Classic design, cheap price, similar configuration, just enough! ! ! By the way, I gave a bunch of things. really 
0	There was no hot water during the day, and there were ants crawling in the bathroom, a small shower room, no bathtub, and no elevator. The breakfast is simple and unimaginable. The computer still has viruses, the soundproofing is poor, and the windowsill can be crawled in and out, which is not safe. Anyway, unlike a Samsung hotel. 
0	"I am a person with a strong subjective color, speaking very arbitrary, I cannot proceed from the overall situation, and cannot look at issues from the perspective of literature and current affairs. Just an outsider's idea. Because of the enthusiasm caused by lust, I once again turned out Zhang Ailing's book and felt that it was not enough, so I would like to buy it again in this life and this world. After reading it, the most eye-catching among them is naturally the women of the Republic of China. In fact, in addition to this article, there are quite a few worth reading, such as writing about mother, about childhood, and hometown. However, I can't read anything that involves other women he wrote. The point is that he is not passionate, but feels innocent. He didn’t understand why he couldn’t talk to Aileen about Xiao Zhou, why Aileen was jealous, why Mr. Fan was jealous, hehe, he loved a lot of people, but whenever he left, there was a new woman beside him. You can fall in love immediately. I don't intend to refute it, because it is easy to be called ""feminism"". I always think this term is weird. People just have to respect each other, and no rights matter. However, I have put this book on top. Literary talent has literary talent, but he is not the only man in this world who has literary talent. I only pay attention to it because Aileen can't forget it. "
0	Advantages: moderate price and convenient location; Disadvantages: the room is small and pungent; the surrounding construction is noisy. The checkout is very slow. It takes half an hour to issue an invoice. 
0	When you read it as a textbook, it is only suitable for a rookie in the workplace. It does not see any value, and it has been praised by so many people. When it comes to novels, the writing style is really not very good, and I really hate the heroine in the book. It looks perfect, but in fact there is an image of a self-righteous little Shanghai woman in my bones. 
0	The buttons on the touchpad are really hard enough to practice your hands! Advise everyone to disable it and use a wireless mouse instead. 
1	JD delivery is still very fast...ASUS has nothing to say, the company has many genuine XPs, and the installation speed of XP is very fast, about 15 minutes. All the drivers and common software are installed in about an hour with an unlimited mouse, which is not bad The mouse sent is made by Logitech, and the workmanship has nothing to say 
0	The screen with a small size of 14.1 looks uncomfortable, but if it’s too large, it’s inconvenient to hold, especially if it’s a 3.5-hour train ride back home on a business trip and then back home. It feels a bit heavy. Maybe you don’t exercise for a long time. I didn’t find it on the HP website. How to register and upgrade to a two-year warranty 
0	"It broke on the third day. I got the inspection report from the Acer Repair Center on the 15th day (27th) because of a business trip. It was shipped the same day to Shanghai Jingdong. As of today, July 1. 5 days have passed. There is no information. I have every day. It takes a long time to call customer service. All I get is ""we will rush you"" "
0	The room was very bad and messy, filled with the smell of rot, the furniture was extremely old, the carpet was dirty, the hot and cold water could not be adjusted, the faucet was leaking, the lampshade was missing, and it was unimaginable that the Samsung logo was still hung. Although some hotels have been open for a long time, they are well maintained and can still be accommodated. But this hotel is almost unmanaged, dilapidated and inaccessible, and it is not the same thing as the website introduction. It is hoped that Ctrip will properly control the agreement of the hotel and not allow such hotels to mislead customers. 
1	The room in this hotel is a bit old. It is estimated that it has been open for several years. The door of the room can only be opened by two people inside and outside. The surrounding environment is not very good. It is recommended to live in a room by the sea in the future. The service attitude is OK, The food is really not good. Don't live there anymore to save money 
0	I feel disappointed. It is not as good as I imagined. The method taught in the book is not specific at all. It gives people a general feeling. I only feel that I am listening to others blowing water and not my own business. Generally speaking, it is not practical! 
0	The process of Toshiba's first launch of Vista was really lengthy. It would be better if it could be equipped with a Toshiba bag. 
1	Finally, I finished reading the straw house with my son. My son was only six years old. I did not read some chapters to him. But from the beginning of the story, he was attracted by the sangsang and bald cranes in the straw house. The same is true for me, although memory My childhood in middle school was not as beautiful and sad as in the books, but as a childlike me, I entered the Cao Fang and Yau Ma Tei Primary School with my son. The author's writing is extremely delicate, and following his description, he feels that he has left everything so easily in his heart and entered his world. Therefore, I solemnly recommend this book to everyone, especially suitable for the fourth and fifth grade elementary school students, it will be helpful to their writing level. 
1	The things are fine, but the delivery is too slow. When they are delivered, the price has been reduced by more than 400. This is how it is done! 
1	"The current configuration should be the lowest price. The optical drive is not Blu-ray! There are also very good ""Elpida"" memory chips. "
0	I found it while reading. This book is not as exciting as the website introduces, and the content is not funny, it just mentions other people's illnesses. Nothing is funny. . . . . Really depressed! 
0	This is the worst so-called 4-star hotel I have ever stayed in! The decoration of the hotel is very rough. The double bed room I stayed in was very hard. The carpet was dirty and there were large stains. The water sprayed from the shower nozzle in the bathroom is so uncomfortable and uncomfortable to hit the body! The hotel is very close to the road, and I was woken up early if I wanted to sleep late in the morning. I don’t know how their stars are rated, ask me Say that even Samsung is not counted! It is better to live at home. 
1	The room was really clean. My husband always said that I have a cleanliness fetish. The room in Jinbanna is hygienic and I am very satisfied! The service attitude is also very good. I have to take a shower the first afternoon. I just turned on the shower and there was no hot water. I called the waiter and said We put the water for a while, and the hot water came. Later, the waiter came to the room twice to ask about the hot water situation. The first time we let us put the water for a while, the second time, she went into the room to check the shower and found out that it was us. The hot water direction is reversed, in short, the service is very timely and the attitude is very good! The hotel has a large outdoor swimming pool, which feels very good, although I did not enter the water personally, I still saw other guests swimming quite happily. It was very blue. We had a water change in the swimming pool after staying for two nights. It should be quite clean. The free pick-up car provided by the wine shop is also very good. The one who picked us up was the rare Santana 3000 in Xishuangbanna, very clean, the driver The people are also very nice. We then rented his car for two and a half days, and the price was very reasonable. The breakfast buffet I think is not bad, five or six Chinese stir-fries, several kinds of western cake bread, salad, bacon, and milk , Fruit juice, and rice noodles. There seems to be no eggs in my impression. I prefer eggs, hehe. 
0	The payment was successful on May 8th. Dangdang.com showed that it will be shipped on May 10th, but so far I haven’t seen the goods or received any notice. Jane doesn’t know how to say it! ! ! 
1	Starting with 1,4799, the price/performance ratio is really good! 2, The function is normal during the installation process, including: no bright spots on the screen, no blue screen phenomenon, normal sound\CD-ROM burning\network\camera, noise and heat dissipation are acceptable; 3, the color is stylish, get rid of The feel of an office notebook, suitable for home use. 
1	Because of youth, you can be willful, not afraid of squandering, and willing to fight the fire for love moths. The people in it have laughter, tears, happiness, sadness, sweetness, and heartbreak, but they shouldn’t regret it. Although I have only read the first story, Su Jin's bravery and perseverance touched me deeply, and moved me deeply in the room late at night. Scenes from the past in the In the Mood for Love come to mind, how lucky we have had such a beautiful and arbitrary youth. If you were a little brave then, would the ending be different? 
0	The ASUS notebook I bought on JD.com found a serious problem the next day and couldn't use it. Later, after testing at ASUS Repair Station, it was found that the motherboard was broken, but due to the long delay in the testing process, it exceeded 15 days for replacement. Now, I request a new machine or a return. 
1	well. Very clean. It is newly decorated. The service is good. Breakfast is also very good. By the way, the quilt is thick but very soft. Haha satisfied 
0	When I open this book, it reminds me of the tepid Korean women in Korean dramas. Maybe this is a cultural difference. 
1	This book was originally bought for a friend, but when I received it, I opened it and looked at it, but I couldn’t let it go. The content is very convincing. It uses many stories to illustrate the importance of excellent quality, because they are all stories. , So not boring. This book is very helpful for personal cultivation and the cultivation of good habits! Especially for boys, sense of responsibility, self-confidence, ethics, quality, self-cultivation and tolerance are mentioned in this book. I recommend it to young friends to take a good look. It will be very helpful to future life, work and study! 
0	Warmth to everyone, don’t live here anymore, turn off the air conditioner at 11pm, and there will be a signal for a while on the Internet. Breakfast is average, the price is not low, it is the worst hotel I have ever booked. Additional review August 3, 2008 Day: Up to two stars, which is the old guest house 
0	The pre-installed VISTA system eats up memory. In the case of 2G memory, the system startup speed is still a bit slow, and there are too many programs loaded at startup, and there are a large row of icons on the desktop. 
0	The location is not as central as Ctrip said. It is about 6-7 minutes drive from Tianhe Shopping Center. If you walk, you can avoid it. Hotel facilities and decoration are very general, up to a three-star standard. Will never choose this place to live again. 
1	I went to read this book because of Buffett. After reading it, I felt that it was worthy of the name-it was really worth it. Although the author elaborated on the difficult value investment concept, the text is not difficult, it can be said that the writing is quite smooth (much better than Buffett...), and supplemented by various examples (although the assets of that era are far less abundant than they are now , But the basic principle remains the same), the explanation is clear and easy to understand. In addition, the translation is also quite satisfactory. Anyone who believes in value investing should take a look at this book, it's not very expensive anyway~~ 
0	I feel that the content is very empty, and I don’t know if my understanding is not good, I didn’t understand it, or if it is really unclear or unclear! 
1	"In the spring season, there is nothing more beautiful than the singing of birds. This booklet is full of pictures and texts. Bring it with you. You can recognize our cute elves at any time. Happy greetings: Hello. Even thinking of the crows in the Forbidden City. There is a feeling of joy. Cherish us and these lovely friends. If you watch ""Silent Spring"", you will definitely sigh that you missed it and lost it forever, bird. Bring a brochure that you can pass on to you Friends, share a beautiful mood like spring, let yourself fly like a bird. Love life, love life. "
0	I hope that Ctrip can find more cost-effective hotels. I went for a four-star hotel. As a result, the room was dirty and messy I could not imagine. I didn’t have time to clean it, the second toilet did not go under the water, the shower nozzle and faucet were broken, the waiter was asked to change the room, but the front desk said you come down and change it yourself, I don’t know if there are other good hotels in Xingtai City, I do I'm served, I won't go live next time. Fortunately, Ctrip's service is okay, the price is cheaper than the front desk asked! 
0	I don’t know how to install a system. I’m really helpless after taking the notebook without a system. I urge that in the future, the computer must be a finished product and the system installed! Do not leave the factory in semi-finished products! (I beg someone to install the system is pitiful!) 
0	"Four words, ""terrible"". I checked in after 11pm. The first is the inconvenience of transportation. To get to the hotel, you must take the special expressway of the Three Gorges Dam. At the same time, you have to stop and check the special pass for several armed police ""blocking stations"" passing by. Even if he showed the hotel's certificate, he would be questioned by the soldiers for a long time, because he was very upset with the child. The hotel arranged for the reception staff who specially sent us the pass and asked us to drive to the house to pick him up, and asked to send him home after completing the formalities. After tossing for a long time, I arrived at the hotel almost one o'clock in the morning. The attitude of the waiter on duty at the reception desk is even worse. "
0	"Only because of Lee Ang's movie ""Lust and Caution"", I bought Zhang Ailing's novel to read. After reading it, I felt disappointed—so short and confusing—how could Director Li make the award-winning film? A woman wants to booby and kill a man (traitor), and at the last moment suddenly feels that this man may really love her-he is buying her a diamond ring, but she is going to kill him, it is impossible to justify it, so she is in a hurry Let him go. But the man wouldn't let her go...Lexus almost killed the man, and sexuality (and precept) really killed the woman. I think the essence of the novel probably lies here. There is nothing new about such a theme, but there is something intriguing about the writing. What I admire is actually the title of the novel: Lust, Caution "
1	I just received the goods. From delivery to receipt, the machine is very good and there is no wear and tear. And the configuration is as stated in the product introduction. It can be said to be pretty awesome! 
0	Why does the price always change? I just paid the money, but before I saw the goods, I cut the price again. I really don't want it. 
0	It's awkward. It's a hotel in the city center. There is an additional connection to the Internet. It costs 4 yuan an hour to grab the money! ! ! ! ! 
1	I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. My daughter is four years old and likes it very much. I have to tell at least two books every day. Each story is very close to life, and the pictures and language are very lively and interesting. It is not only educational for children, but I also learned how to deal with various problems in children's growth. It is a good book for adults and children. The story in each book is relatively long, which is not suitable for babies who are too small. Some of the contents of my daughter’s age are not yet understandable. I think this set of books can accompany her to elementary school. 
1	"From an overall point of view, when a hot spot develops from generation to development, there must be a market from hesitation to response. And once the hot spot is formed, it will not end immediately, unless there is a sudden negative pressure. Only when the hot spot heats up to a hot state will the tide ebb. This is the saying ""the market ends in cheers"". Therefore, if you see that investors around you are unwilling to chase this hot spot, it means that the market is over; if you see that investors around you agree and join this hot spot, it means that the market is about to end. Recognizing this is very important to prevent the transfer and disappearance of hot spots. "
1	In reality, corruption exists in many forms. I work on the front line of anti-corruption, and I deeply understand the difficulty of investigating corruption cases. Just like the people and things written in the side of the novel, to a certain extent, I have revealed the star hidden under the splendid clothing of the corrupt elements. Dirty heart. The author is a person close to corrupt elements, who can more directly appreciate the taste of corruption from a perceptual perspective, so the writing is very vivid. It was a feasting world, and also a dead end without a way back...Who can stand alone in it? How easy is it to be innocent alone in the siege of corruption? 
0	The heat dissipation is better than those of 540, and the surface is very cold. However, the CPU temperature detected by EVREST is generally between 66 and 69. The temperature of the hard disk and the motherboard is normal, but the CPU is terrible. I put the SD card in the card reader, but I can’t get it out. Customer service will fix it tomorrow. 
0	1. The vista system cannot be accessed. 2. After installing the xp system, the sound card driver is too strenuous. 3. The Bluetooth cannot be found. 4. The price is still a bit expensive 
1	I bought a lot of children's books recommended by Dangdang for my daughter, such as Skerry, Arrow, and Carmela. My daughter is not very interested. She is the only one who reads the Romi series without annoying. Every night I read a story about Romi before going to bed. She can repeat many stories. Through this book, I truly realized that the right is the best. Through this book, my daughter compares with Romi, those things Romi can do and he can do, and those behaviors should be corrected, and learn common sense through Romi and behavior. I bought several sets of the Romi series and my daughter's age. 
0	The quality of the book is very poor: the first few pages of the book received are bound upside down, and some pages are not bound and can be taken down directly. I sent it back to Dangdang for replacement. It has been more than 20 days and there is no news at all. I wrote an email to notify the reason for the replacement, but I did not see any reply. In order to exchange the goods, I have to make a special trip to the post office. This time buying a book is simply annoying. Such service is too bad. 
0	You must not live there for the following reasons: 1. Poor management and poor service quality. I booked a room at Baifu Hotel for 3 days. I did not find the key card the next day (the checkout time). I asked the front desk what to do. The front desk did not provide any suggestions. The first sentence is to ask me to compensate for the key card 50 The yuan in cash was mad at the time; that’s not counted. The waiter helped me redo the key card that morning, but I couldn’t open the door. I went up and down to change the new key card three times, but it still couldn’t be opened. The waiter said Help me solve the problem as soon as possible. Because I was in a hurry, I left first, but when I came back after 6 o'clock in the evening, the new key card still couldn't open the door. Later, when I negotiated a room change, the duty manager and the front office manager kept hiding. See you there, it took me nearly an hour to change rooms; my colleague and I stayed at Baifu at the same time and stayed for two nights. During this period, until the third day of checkout and left the room, there was no waiter to help clean up. room! 2. The sound insulation effect is extremely poor, and the construction on the nearby construction site disturbs rest. The soundproofing effect of the room is extremely poor. The room next to the elevator can clearly hear people walking, talking, and the sound of elevator switching. In the room, you can also hear the voice of the next room. And there are often upstairs knocking on the floor in the middle of the night. The sound is constant and very annoying; there is a construction site behind the hotel, and work is often started at 6-7 in the morning, and the noisy people are too annoying. 
0	Very ordinary hotel, the facilities in the room are very old, and the room delivery fee has to be increased by 50%. In short, if you can’t find any good things, don’t go if you have other options. 
1	When I went to Luoyang on the 11th, I lived in this hotel. The general feeling is that the location is good. There is a bus to the Longmen Grottoes at 1 yuan. It is very convenient (I took a taxi and only spent 30 yuan) The reception is very enthusiastic, but the disadvantage is that the room is really small, a four-star room is a bit unreasonable, but it is not bad that there is a computer in the room. 
1	Through the narratives of the orphans who survived the Great Famine, scenes of tragic situations of hunger and death are torn apart before people. These personal stories composed of details made the disaster more concrete and sensible, forcing the people who survived to face and reflect. In the history of contemporary Chinese literature, it should be considered the first time that this period of history of the'Great Famine' has been written in a documentary manner and in a literary form. I would like to call it the letter history, as documentary literature. With the passage of history, many literary bubbles that treat numbness as interesting will disappear, but such words will be passed on forever 
0	The CD-ROM reads the disk and sounds like a printer. It may be inherited from HP’s old line. Haha. It’s troublesome to install the system. I checked the disk several times. Finally I typed a DOS command called mbr. Then repartitioned and installed the system. 
0	1. The battery is not strong enough, and the battery life is almost inferior. 2. The memory is a little bit short. 3. The switch of the wireless network is not good. 4. A keyboard is loose. 5. The offcie software is a trial version. 
1	The room is quite large, clean and tidy. There are many school residential snack bars around, relatively quiet, the minibus knows the entrance of the hotel, and the traffic is quite convenient. Recommend this place~ If you exchange currency, go out the back door and walk forward on the corner. There is a newsstand at the corner. The owner is quite interesting, rmb:hk =1:1.2, the hotel exchange is 100:97 dizzy~ 
1	The service attitude is good. Every service staff you meet can greet you. There are many foreigners. This hotel may have different levels of rooms. Next time we have to change our room. 
0	1. There is no paper towel in the whole room. 2. There is no exhaust fan in the toilet. I don’t know if someone complained before that the exhaust fan was noisy and people couldn’t sleep and then removed it. 3. The water boiler was not clean and it was dark. There is limescale, even wherever the water comes out. 4 The footrest plastic in the shower room is super dirty and dark enough to scare people to death. 5 There is no air-conditioning in the elevator, and there is no air-conditioning when entering the elevator on such a hot day. Would you like to think about the comfort of the stew inside? 6 A friend of mine said that walking up the hallway of the guest room upstairs seems to have entered a sauna, which shows how ugly the hallway is. 7 I ran out of paper in the room (here refers to the paper for writing things, like some friends often travel on business, it is inevitable to use paper to write things) The waiter does not put paper in the room. 8 The charge for the New International Exhibition Center is 12 yuan, but no one knows where the hotel is when it comes out at the exhibition. Someone knows where the hotel is in Jinjiang Inn. The hotel is hard to find in an alley. One thing is good, there is a small shop at the door. The traffic is okay. There is not much place to eat around, there is a western restaurant. Foreigners say it is not delicious. The hotel itself has Chinese food. I haven't tried it before. The room is clean. The breakfast is terrible, and it costs 20 yuan less. The service at the front desk of the hotel is so-so. A woman asks her what she will ignore and advises female friends not to stay. Will never stay in this hotel again. 
1	The advantage is really not found, the only thing is the price, the system is unusable, and the after-sales service is irrelevant. If you say a lot of things, you just have to get it done by yourself. 
0	Maybe because I am not working in a foreign company, this book did not resonate with me. It doesn't feel as attractive as the reviews on the Internet. It's just a bland reading after reading it. 
0	"I don’t really like it myself. Just like a parent’s evaluation, it may aggravate the child’s rebellion. The new mantra of my children now is ""XX, XX, always XX, I don’t want XX!"" "
0	This book captured the hearts of the female compatriots, and there are so many books with this name now. This is a really bad book. Don't buy it. I regret it! 
1	The transportation is convenient. Take the Airport Express Hong Kong Station and take the H1 directly. Walk to the subway station for 5 minutes. There is a Ding Ding car at the door; the room is small, but clean and tidy, which is pretty good in Hong Kong. There are many restaurants around, eating No problem; the hotel is close to the Golden Bauhinia Square, you can walk to watch the flag raising ceremony in the morning. 
0	How to put it...this is also called Samsung? It's more like a guest house, besides, things in Jinggangshan are not expensive! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	The appearance of the book is elegant and stylish, the cost performance is very high, the quality is stable, the delivery is fast (5/2, delivered in the morning on the 3rd), the buttons are also very soft, the screen is Samsung's reliable quality and a 2G memory stick is fast. 
0	It took a while to install the system. If you can't use the ghost version directly, you must first go to the BIOS to modify a content. 
1	It's portable, it looks good, and the speed is fast. The memory is already installed and anti-virus software is used. Black Mouse also likes it very much, not bad. 
1	I used a 50 yuan coupon and spent 2649 to get it. The price is invincible. Of course, if you start with 3199, there is no advantage in price. The product inherits ASUS's consistent quality and all aspects of workmanship are better than MSI. Why compare with MSI’s, because I have bought MSI’s U90 and U100 before, which should have a say, and the battery has reached an unimaginable eight hours or more. As a netbook, it can basically sweep other brands Now, the price/performance ratio of 2649 is beyond imagination! ! 
0	The service is poor, how can there be no hot water in a hotel? I saw a review in January saying that there is no hot party and there is no show or no. The complaint said that they need to change to another one. They actually said that they called me Kolu, I immediately Move to another house. 
0	My order number is 1401482205~ The book was received very quickly, but one is missing. The money is not counted. What about this book? 
0	The keyboard feels a bit loose to use, and it doesn't feel as elastic or as tight as other brands. No Bluetooth is a big pity. 
0	I don't know what's going on. My touchpad is very insensitive. Compared with the notebook I used before, it feels far less sensitive. And the middle of the keyboard is tilted up, it feels like a shed. And the left and right buttons on the touchpad are too hard. I always worry about crushing the notebook every time I force myself. 
1	I stayed in the Overseas Chinese Building on January 6. I caught a bit of wind and cold in the car when I arrived. When I checked in, I kept sneezing. The front desk staff immediately asked me if I had a cold. What moved me most was that when I entered the room, the room attendant brought a bowl of hot brown sugar and ginger water. This kind of humanized service really made people feel warm. It is worthy of being the only four-star hotel in Tai'an. It is only a five-minute walk from the hotel to Dai Temple. There is also a map of the city and Mount Tai presented by the Golden Key Service Center. The service of the hotel precedes the guest's opening. Hotel Golden Key rented a car and booked tickets for us. On the second day after returning home, we unexpectedly received their greeting text message. We are still very happy to choose Taishan Overseas Chinese Building. And we also agreed to take a friend to visit Mount Tai in the spring of 2008. 
1	The front desk is not as slow as the legend, it was ok when I went. The overall service is not bad. I went in March and the room was a bit cold, and I was shivering when I took a shower. Internet speed is ok. 
0	I only stayed for one day from October 5th to 6th. The hotel arrived at about 12 noon, but the room has not been cleaned. There is a smell in the room. The reason is that the hotel is not staffed enough to clean up~~ speechless! It's done at 2 o'clock. I suggest you choose another hotel. By the way, disposable slippers are 10 yuan a pair and there is a restaurant on the side of the hotel that seems to be a BTV. The buffet is 30 people, which is absolutely super value. It's expensive and small. 
0	The price is ok, the location is good, but the decoration of the room is too old, not clean, and smelly! 
0	I went to pick up the goods, and found that the price was reduced, and I was depressed. The right tray seemed to be a bit unfitting, there was a gap, and the hard disk sounded when I turned on it. The sound was relatively loud and uncomfortable to hear. There was no camera. 
1	For machines below 4000 thousand, it is estimated that this one has the best performance. The design of the machine is very practical, there are many electronic devices, and there are many indicator lights, which is very convenient. Install the system with GHOSTXP and open the IDE. Unfortunately, SATA AHCI has not been opened, and it is under study. . . 
0	I bought a set for my boyfriend’s sister! My sister was very happy to get it, and started playing immediately, but from time to time it was always stuck and intermittent! It seems to be edited, and the cut is not good enough to connect! It's so shameless to give it to my sister! 
1	Cost-effective, 3DMark 06 5022 Cinebench R10 4021 in the case of browsing the web, the battery can support 2 hours and 20 minutes perfect screen. The machine has good heat dissipation. The screen is AUO. In the first week of 2006, the color was average. It is more troublesome to install XP, and the driver must be found by the user. The touchpad is too close to the keyboard, and it is easy to touch by mistake. The keyboard feels average. 
1	The front desk service attitude of the Bank of China Building is very good. Helped me solve the reservation problem in time. I am very satisfied. The best hotel in Baoding city is the Bank of China, with a four-star standard. When I arrive in Baoding, I live in the Bank of China Tower, and there is no other choice. 
1	Although white is not what I want, it does not show fingerprints, which is not bad. Long standby time and compact power adapter. The keyboard is comfortable. 
0	The room is too small. When I got the room at the front desk, I said that I didn't have a reservation, and I had to call Ctrip to confirm! 
1	Overall it feels okay, the price is higher, after all, it is okay to buy such a machine at this price. I just bought it and I am familiar with it 
0	It's too big, with a size of 12~13 inches, this configuration is cool. The machine is very thick, I have to mention that. 
1	The location is very good. There are supermarkets near Zhongshan Square and Zhuozhan Square, but the hotel rooms are small, the facilities are old, and have great flavor. The breakfast is good. 
1	First-class workmanship, beautiful appearance, great graphics card, Altlanstar brand speakers, metal texture at the hand drag, and a complete variety of interfaces 
0	1. The gift package was written when purchasing, but there was no package when the book was received. When I checked the order at this time, the terms of the gift package were gone. 2. It dropped by 100 as soon as I bought it. 
0	I have ordered a book for such a long time, I have never encountered such a book, comfortable to give to the elderly, saying that it is a gift of full-color meridian map at all. 
0	Things are much uglier than the photos. There is a gray in the house. I thought it was the same, but it turned out to be black. 
1	The decoration is relatively new and it is a bit far from the shopping point. You have to go out and turn right, then turn left on the first road, and walk for about 15 minutes to reach the shopping center. There are 2 appliance stores nearby, and there is a pharmacy across the road. You can buy Pien Tze Huang or Yindan Pinggan Capsules 
1	Orders made at 9 o'clock in the morning on Saturday, and arrived at 4 o'clock in the afternoon that day, without any urging, it can be said that it is very fast, thank you! 
1	"A very beautiful novel, the freehand brushwork is so cute, Li Zeliang is not bad, life encounters, it is fate, and there will be a story. ""Weiyuqing? Weiyuqing. ‘Will the evening breeze be sent gently, tenderness is thousands of miles’, is this world full of suffering or merciless suffering? As long as it is true love, it’s suffering! "
1	The appearance is beautiful, although it is easy to have fingerprints, it is still very beautiful, and the battery life is long, which is better than other similar notebooks. 
0	It seems that buying a pirated version is a chance. The first four of the ten pictures are good, the fifth one is not available, and the other four pictures are good, and there is sound at the top, but there is no sound at the back. 
1	The screen is good, and the keyboard is easy to use, but it feels easy to get dust in, and it will be more troublesome to clean up later. I added a 2G Samsung memory, and I feel that the speed is okay. It's OK for me as a programmer. 
0	The environment is poor, the road noise is very loud, and the sound insulation between the rooms is not handled well, you can hear the speech in the corridor when you sleep on the bed. The room is small. In addition, it is very far from the airport. The taxi driver took the outer ring road and said it was fast, but he walked more than 40 kilometers. The environment around the hotel is chaotic. 
0	I have been using Ctrip for so many years. This time I was so disappointed and embarrassed. I wanted to stay in the best hotel, but it turned out to be a big hit. The hotel is built in a residential area, and the surrounding environment can be imagined. Know. It's been almost half a year since it opened, and it's still in the trial period. The rooms are ok, and the bathroom is terrible. The drain is not smooth, the shower room is estimated to be only one square meter, and there is no place for shampoo, and the bathroom is small Poor, I sit on the toilet, with my left shoulder resting on the shower room and my right shoulder resting on hygiene 
0	I bought 15 copies of Xiaoxiong**** and received the book yesterday. The books I came to occasionally have the feeling that some books are a little old, but in general it is ok. But this time it is too much ____15 books, no One is clean, and 4 of them are glued together after being damp (the book is not damaged on the road, the outside packaging is good). I want to ask, would you give such a book to your child as a gift yourself ? I will send you 4 precious broken books. It is just for you to use as teaching materials. Take a look. In the future, such books can also be sent. 
0	The facilities are average and relatively old. The environment is noisy. There is a restaurant on the second floor with mixed personnel exchanges. When checking out, the waiter who cleaned the room even falsely accused the toothbrush for use, dizzy! It's ridiculous and infuriating! It is estimated that this waiter took it himself, and in turn falsely accused the customer. It is recommended not to put those charged items in the room in the future. Customers who need it can go to the grocery store below to buy, otherwise some low-quality waiters use or take the charged items themselves, which makes the guests annoyed. 
1	When I arrived in Hong Kong on the 22nd, I thought that the hotel address was better, but I was disappointed. When booking with Ctrip, I said not to have a low floor or a double room, but when I arrived at the front desk, I was told that I had not received these requests. It is easy to change to a big bed room on the 3rd floor. The window looks like a platform, which is very depressing. The bathroom has a strange smell. The TV is small and broken. The service is not very good. Anyway I feel cheated. . . . 
0	XP's driver is not complete and should be improved. Although XP is going to withdraw from the stage of history, it is still the mainstream system and sl400 should follow up. 
1	After installing the system, all drivers, and common software, I feel that the speed is quite satisfactory. The performance of the graphics card is not to say, the sound card effect is also very good, that is, the speaker sound quality is inferior. When the machine is running, the noise is good, not too loud. 
1	Very average four-star hotel. The environment is good. The rooms are not very good. The service is okay. 
0	I bought it for my children, so I can relax my mood. Watch with my son, there are more common languages. We all like it. 
0	This book became popular in the craze of Chinese studies. The true culture belongs to all mankind, and the practice of advocating Chinese learning is itself counter-cultural. The affairs that appear in this context must be a freak. 
0	I bought it once before, and all the books are pretty good. How come this time? Are all three books of good quality? ? ? But the content is good, 
0	Service attitude-without attitude, it doesn't matter whether it is good or bad. The receptionist is watching people-using eyes to white the doorman-what the doorman looks like, I have never seen the room-the lock is broken hotel description-even the Chinese is wrong (Chaozhou in Zhejiang) , Not to mention the introduction in English, oh, the English translation of the hotel description itself misspelled breakfast. After eating, I found something outside to eat. Room price: 390/night, deposit 800? ? ! ! 
1	I remember when I was in junior high school, I borrowed a prairie hut from the city library, and I couldn’t put it down after reading it. At that time, there was also a forest hut on the shore of Silver Lake. Since I can only borrow one book at a time, I feel very nervous every time I borrow a book, for fear that the next one will be borrowed by others. I really like the positive, hard-working, optimistic life attitude of the Roland family (the translator was Laura at the time). It is worth learning from each of us. I finally bought a full set this time. I'm so happy. Although the book is a bit small, like children's books, the printing and fonts are very good and very suitable. I hope that all the big friends will come to read, not as a set of children's books. 
0	"I like Zhang Ailing so much, I bought the complete works, and ""Break and Hollow Love"". I bought this book just to learn more about Ailing. Somewhat disappointed. Inexplicably sad, I imagined Ai Ling should be a golden branch and jade leaf. Although she was suffering from the wind and dust, she was also pure and clean. She didn't want to meet Hu Lancheng, such a vulgar demon king. I remember reading a book by He Kun. Although he is a big corrupt official, he also has a kind of admiration for his wife Feng with affection and intention, beginning and end. In the end, Aileen wandered for half her life, and died in depression. Birth is not in time! "
1	"First of all, many people say that the transportation is inconvenient. Those of you are really used to the subway. In fact, there are still many places in Hong Kong that are not within a 15-minute walk of the subway station. However, it is a 10-15 minute walk from the Sheung Wan MTR station. It is a bit of a breakdown if we go to Hong Kong every day to walk in various shopping malls, and go back to the hotel for 10 minutes. There are ding-ding cars and buses available, and there are still near 12 o’clock in the evening. It’s quite interesting to sit in a ding-ding car and drive to the end, but it takes a little too long to get to Central, Causeway Bay. , So it’s better to take a bus or a Ding Ding bus to Sheung Wan MRT station if you go out in the morning. There are many small restaurants nearby. I have had breakfast at a few of them. They have both Chinese and Western styles. The taste is good and the price is cheap. You can buy a newspaper from the neighborhood to read. There are also two Pokka and Watsons and convenience stores nearby, but they are very small. As for the hotel room, we didn’t have so much luck to be upgraded to a full sea view room, but the half sea view room is very satisfactory to us. There is a small refrigerator and the bathroom is already considered luxurious in a Hong Kong hotel. The sea view is invincible. Beautiful, I want to break the glass to take a picture. The bed is two single beds put together. There are not many channels on the TV, but it doesn't matter. In those few days there was a European Cup and I fell asleep after just one glance. The service is very polite, but all the service staff in the lobby do not speak good English in Mandarin. The porter will take the initiative to help you carry your luggage to the lobby. There was an episode where I went up and found that the card could not open the door, so I went down to ask. After asking, I changed my card and came up to open the door to see that the room was full of things. It turns out that the wrong room number was written, Khan. As you have said, there will be a Ming report on your hand every day, but not on the day you check out. It's really ""warm"" details. The room was cleaned very clean and very nice, and the valuables I left around were all neatly arranged. After all, GF claimed that he would live in this place when he came to Hong Kong. Although the traffic is inconvenient, other aspects can make up for it. "
0	I bought this book, the binding is okay, there is no color insert, the text of the book is slightly hollow, in short, among so many similar books, this price is not worth buying. 
0	I bought this book after listening to the introduction of the TV station. I feel that this book is written for foreign babies. For my own children, this book does not feel suitable. 
0	I booked two rooms. The soundproofing of the hotel is too poor, the sound of opening and closing doors one after another at night, doorbells in other rooms, the sound of telephones, and the sound of conversation in the corridor. . . Sounds in your ears! As soon as these sounds stopped, the tractors and large vehicles on the road in the early morning began to move again. Only slept for three or four hours all night! When booking a room with Ctrip, the hotel began to reserve a room with a large air-conditioning unit outside the window facing the inner courtyard. After reading the comments of the previous netizens, I was afraid that the karaoke was noisy, so I switched to the room facing the road. The result is still the same. I strongly recommend that friends do not. Book this hotel. At the same time, the carpet was surprisingly dirty, with marks from various liquids (including vomit). The room is fairly large and the bed is not small, which is its advantage. In addition, two hundred meters east of the hotel, at the intersection of Qianwang Street and Panlong, there is a restaurant called Haoding that tastes good, and the price is not expensive. The five of us ordered ten dishes, two bottles of beer, and one bottle of Sprite. Diverse, but also eat several wild vegetables, native chicken and so on. Lin'an Hotel looks pretty good, try it next time. 
0	The keyboard is worse than expected. Sometimes the sound of the optical drive is louder. The camera is a tasteless function. It is better than nothing... 
1	"1 Perfect screen (God bless) 2 There are not so many heat dissipation problems 3 The installation system is okay, I use the new carrot system 3.0, and then you can refer to http://wuyilala.com/index.php/2009/06/09 /14/08/03/, pay attention to the ""fourth step"", everything is ok! The cpu is really powerful and powerful. "
1	"After reading some reviews on this book, some made people anxious, and found that some parents did not notice a very important problem when reading the book, that is, the meridian of adults is different from that of children. Do not use ""Human Meridian User Manual"" The meridian and acupoint techniques in here are used to compare children. For the value of a book, I personally feel that it is ""take the essence and remove the dross."" There is no need to believe it all, and there is no need to beat it to death. Most parents are for the good of their children, so some necessary medical knowledge parents must master. It is necessary to take the best of a hundred families. "
0	The original windows driver disk is good, but it is a little troublesome to install the wireless network card. It is useless to use the GE780 to NE771 on the built-in CD first. After searching online, I found out that the wireless network card used by this machine is NE-766. Then go to the Internet to search for the driver, download and test, OK! 
0	I read it hastily. It’s too common. It’s just the same as the last one. There are many prints and many sales. I don’t know why it is so popular. Although the publisher plus the hype of XX does not prevent it from becoming a book. The fast food book and commentary, it is the last 
0	The carpet is dirty and the springs under the mattress bulge out. Sleeping is uncomfortable. Very poor soundproofing. Very noisy. Some distance away from the city. It is not very convenient. I think it is terrible. Great but disappointed after entering the room. Why is there so much difference inside and out. I originally planned to stay for two days and then checked out after staying for one day. 
1	Beautiful...It's just that the system is hard to get in....Ghost doesn't get in...The BIOS still doesn't work to modify the IDE, and then I took the installation version to install it... 
1	"I bought this book in January. I often read the author’s blog. After I bought the book, I read it all in one go. The author has studied economics for a long time and paid attention to people's livelihood. He is a rare talent in the country. The book comprehensively introduces the emergence, process, and impact of the financial crisis on today's world economic life, and comprehensively connects the global monetary policy and economic strategy books. It is also very enlightening to ordinary people. For example, ""resources are king"" and the internationalization of the renminbi have proposed many feasible strategic policies for the country to respond to crises. A good book in time. I sincerely hope that leaders at all levels can study well. "
0	This book is one of the worst books I have bought. I think it has the following problems: First, the pictures are too small and the layout of the pictures is crowded, not suitable for my kindergarten daughter, even myself It feels uncomfortable to see. Second, there are cultural differences. The character scenes and drawing styles in the book are all Western. I think it is not suitable for Chinese children to recognize, because it is difficult for them to correspond to the objects in the book with the objects around them in reality. For young children, it may not be possible to understand the connotation of some Western humor. Third, I think it lacks a distinct theme. For example, one of the storytelling books is obviously a simple collection of some stories. There is no connection between the stories, and the theme of the story has no division of labor (for example, it can be divided into nature, love, Wisdom, sports, etc.), so after watching it, I can't remember what I saw. 
0	I was very happy, but after reading a part of the book, I found that 6 pages were blank? ! Dizzy, I'm so angry, buying books online is risky 
0	Low-end machine. The heat dissipation, workmanship, design, and materials are still a bit worse than the high-end ones. Just bear it for the sake of cheap price. 
1	Small and light~~It is the type of notebook I have always hoped to have~~Now I don’t like to play any games~~So it is very good to go online or watch movies~~qq games~~haha 
1	I bought nine books in the first and second series through the introduction of other mothers on the Internet. Give it to my baby as a gift on Children's Day. When the deliveryman delivered the book to my hand, I looked at it first. I think there is no mistake in buying it. Its content and pictures are very exciting, vivid and easy to understand, which is very suitable for my children. When I gave the book to my child, the baby was very happy and excited and couldn't wait to wait for me to tell him. Parents often give gifts to their children, but they can give a gift that can make the baby happy and beneficial. It's worth spending some money. 
0	"Convenient place: 1), close to the airport; 2), there is a car pick-up, very convenient. The place of extreme dissatisfaction: 1), the harassment call keeps on, and said to the other end of the phone:'You guys call again, I'm going to call the police ""Get an arrogant reply: ""If you have a kind, report it!"" I was so scared that I quickly unplugged the phone line; 2), I bought mineral water in the store in the lobby, because there was no change, I gave Zhang 100 yuan, and found I returned a fake money of 50. I found out later. I don't recommend everyone to live there. "
1	The room environment is good, the polite service at the front desk is also in place, praise! 
1	I bought this book yesterday, and when I received it, I started to engage in activities to send memory and hard disk....I can’t help it after the order is completed... I feel a bit unkind. 
0	"From the beginning to the end of sexual depression, a lot of space is devoted to repetitive and unchanged psychological activities, which is of little significance. Originally a very simple story, it was written so long but still looked very thin, the character image is flat like a piece of paper, but such a book is so popular with so many people, but it is very interesting, is it now that Chinese people desire ""pure love"" This level? Really depressing. "
1	The appearance is very beautiful, there is an urge to buy. But I still didn't buy it. The screen is too small for my nearsighted people. I bought it for a friend. 
1	1. Lightweight and compact, with exquisite workmanship; 2. The screen display effect is good, the viewing angle is great for viewing from left to right, and it is still a bit narrow for viewing from top to bottom. 3. The keyboard is great, and typing is very comfortable. I have played with ASUS Easy PC, and typing is too painful; 4. The battery lasts for a long time, basically 5 hours without problems. 
0	I think the content is very empty, not as good as the introduction. Although the book is thick, the text is large and the line spacing is large. Basically finished in more than 20 minutes 
1	"The first book recommended by my teacher in college was ""Glory and Dreams"", but it was a pity that I didn't finish reading it at the time, otherwise I felt that I would be closer to the journalist's dream. The way Americans record history is very different from the traditional Chinese official revision history or the folk revision history. This book basically covers all aspects of social life at that time, ranging from macro narrative topics such as World War II, the economic crisis, and the Apollo landing on the moon, as small as people's clothing, popular music, and advertising slogans. It doesn't make people feel tedious and boring, and it's humorous to read. "
0	I gave a hotel 1 point for the first time because it had a four-star sign. Although the price is cheap in Jiangyin hotels of the same level, it is indeed the worst four-star hotel I have ever stayed in. It is recommended to remove the four-star brand first, start with some aspects of the two-star, and then follow the three-star standards, and wait until all three-star standards are met before re-hanging the four-star brand. The air conditioner needs to be set up, it is too noisy. The toilet facilities, even if they are not replaced with new ones, have to make people feel that they are not too old, and some places are still yellow, even the public toilets on the roadside in Shanghai are not worse than it. room? It's only two-star level, and it's not like fooling guests! 
0	The only advantage of this book is that I understand what hype is! In this world, all three teachers and nine liu are here to write books, and they became best sellers accidentally! I think writing reviews should be based on conscience, because our reviews may affect the choices of other customers. Most of the things in this book are my own experience. As for the scientific basis, she doesn't know how to say it. I personally think it is not credible. Hope everyone will consider it! 
1	Stayed for one night in early April 2008. Overall it feels good, especially on the side facing Zhongshan, next to the Nanjing Museum, there are also many good things to see. The Huaiyang restaurant downstairs is a bit expensive and the dishes are average. I would like to say that I have been to Nanjing several times and I feel so good! Additional comments April 27, 2008: Remember to talk about the shortcomings, which is to ask for money online! As a five-star hotel, there is no need to be so stingy, right? 
1	"This is the first time I have commented on a book on Dangdang.com. Because I hope my message will allow more people to read ""Animal Archives"" and ""An Ant Leading Me away"". I believe that there will be more people who love animals and who have not yet discovered that they love animals and nature. After reading these two books by Jiang Zidan, they will make more positive words and deeds and love all the creatures on the earth together. Please read these two books by all means. Of course, if you do not feel moved or contemplated after reading, then I can only say to you: Sorry, I wasted your time! You are indeed not the same with me! "
0	It is very troublesome to install XP. You need to prepare an external floppy drive and install drivers for the optical drive and south bridge. There is no official driver download. Only call customer service and ask them to send it to you. Especially the sound card is extremely troublesome. It is recommended that novices install XP and not buy this machine. No problem with Vista. 
0	I calculated it, the standby time is almost six hours, which seems to be different from the advertised. What's even more depressing is that after just two days of buying, Jingdong has an activity of returning 200 yuan in cash. 
0	The book was poorly bound, and it broke into several copies within a day of reading it. A closer look shows that the book has a long strip of glue on the facade, and all the pages of the book are glued together by this layer of glue, which can easily split. 
1	The rooms are well decorated and clean, the environment is good, the swimming pool water is clean, suitable for vacation. 
1	I rarely go to Yichang. I heard from my colleagues. The price/performance ratio is good. It is a good hotel in Yichang. 
1	After buying it, I will drop it. Hey, I’m depressed. No, it’s okay. Samsung screen. Anyway, it’s okay. If you can use it, it’s OK. 
1	I think the writing of this book is quite true and touching, using seemingly plain language and simple words to describe all the details about the mother clearly. It expresses the author's love and attachment to his mother in perfect words. Although the article looks very plain, but to be honest, I am really moved! ! The tree wants to be quiet but the wind keeps on, and the child wants to be filial but not to wait. Take the time to honor our own parents! ! ! ! 
0	The content of the book can be seen everywhere... What people have to admit is that its packaging and paper are very good. It feels very clean~~ 
0	I have used my left hand for a long time to bring out the slight heat, the system is visit, and the partition is very troublesome. So far, I haven't installed xp, so the expert can give me some advice. (It has been changed to install xp under IED) 
0	The booked room was on the 4th floor when I checked in. The phone was broken for a few days and arranged for me to stay. I found it at 11pm, and the front desk replied that I would change it tomorrow. I only stay for one night, boss. At my insistence, I changed a room on the first floor with a parking lot outside, so I couldn't sleep at all. 
1	Although the hotel is relatively old, the room feels okay, the service is good, and the breakfast variety is a little bit less. The starting price for a taxi to the beach. Walk 15 minutes to Haoyoudu Supermarket. It is very convenient to live here on business trips in the development zone. 
1	"Because there is free broadband, I booked a deluxe single bed room...Here are some of my pros and cons: Pros: 1. Good environment, villa-type house.. Coconut trees planted everywhere.. A large Swimming pool. 2. The location is good, it belongs to the city center.. 2 minutes away is a large supermarket (for locals).. 3 minutes away, the place to eat is very convenient. There is a fruit market within 2 minutes’ walk.. Evening The surrounding roads are also quite lively. 3. The rooms are fairly clean.. 4. There is breakfast, it should be no problem to deal with it casually... Disadvantages: 1. The room is relatively small, and hot water seems to be available after time... Because I usually don’t have hot water in the bath in the afternoon. 2. At night, I surf the Internet at the same speed as a cow, and I can’t open the webpage at all.. I don’t know why... Ask the help desk and the answer is ""We are like this"". More room rates are okay for such a hotel...We can't always ask for the hotel to be the same as our own home.. Besides, at home, you may sometimes complain that the bathroom smells and the kitchen is too small.. We came out Always follow the situation... I wish you all a pleasant journey... "
1	The books are of good quality and trustworthy; in addition, Jingdong's service is indeed fast and the service attitude is also very good. give it a like! ! ! ! 
1	In terms of the same price, the configuration is good, the brand is well known, and the quality is guaranteed. The business model has a general appearance and a good button feel. Dell's power adapter has a nice shape and is relatively lightweight. 
1	The transportation is very convenient and the service is good. There are many places to eat within a short walk. It is good, but the elevator needs the room key to be troublesome. Additional comments July 14, 2008: There are fewer TV stations, just about ten. There are also many foreign stations. Most of the local stations in China cannot be seen, which is not very good. 
1	It's not bad, it's more practical. Don't look at the online stupidity when installing the system. It's purely nothing to look for. Anything using a USB virtual CD-ROM drive iso is a flicker. The simplest is to make a WINPE with a USB disk, enter pe, and then use PM deleted the partition, cleared the MBR, re-partitioned, and used ghost to build a system, which took half an hour. 
0	I bought it because I saw that the book review was well written, but after I bought the book, my son didn't like it at all. 
1	Not particularly satisfied. The location is not very good but the price is reasonable. I only found out after I went, he is a 3 star, and the appearance is a bit old 
1	"The first novel by McCullers, the author of ""Song of Sad Café"", is also her most powerful masterpiece. It ranks 17th in the ""Top 100 English Novels of the 20th Century in Modern Library"" and was once rated as the 100 best novels. One of the best gay novels. The background of the story is similar to the hot southern town in ""Song of Sad Cafe"". The novel mainly tells about the same-sex love of two deaf-mute girls. They talk to themselves and cannot hear each other's heart. If same-sex love exists, the theme highlights the McCullerian theme: loneliness is absolute. , The deepest love cannot change the ultimate loneliness of mankind. "
0	It's a bad hotel, it's a hotel. It feels a bit bad. The lobby is like a temporary one. There is no security guard at the door. There are bicycles parked next to the window, so there is no sense of security. The hotel facilities are outdated, the beds are small and difficult to sleep, no pure water is provided, and the boiling water is very difficult to drink. The condition of the bathroom is not as good as that of a better guest house. The breakfast style is less and unpalatable. This is the worst star hotel I've ever stayed in, and it is incomparable with a budget hotel. I really don't know why Ctrip would recommend it. 
0	The facilities are old, the bathroom is really dirty and there is no elevator 
0	Originally, I liked the piano surface very much, but for the computer, it is easier to get dirty. So, fish and bear's paws are indispensable, so just pay attention to it. 
0	It’s far from the city. I chose the airport pick-up service. The driver’s attitude is not good. The hotel feels a bit old. I saw the computer in the room and thought that the facilities were good. But after asking, I will charge you a full day fee of 60. , Ruthless! Even if I don’t sleep, it’s not worth it! Comprehensive: Not suitable for backpackers or young people 
1	"Lin Xi is a favorite author on ""The Least Talk"". same. ""The Journey Lost in the Boundary"" did not disappoint me. The most touching is the phrase ""Goodbye"" at the end of the story. Goodbye. Cheng Jie. Goodbye. Kajing. Kai always thinks that he does not belong to that world. So I chose to leave. Choose to continue to return to their own world. There is no way to let myself watch Cheng Jie leave first. Saw Kajing leaving. Suddenly feel that everything is worth it. She just returned to her own world. Just went back. "
1	Compared to 1000H, the battery is not prominent. Standby time is longer. The basic functions of the netbook are all available. 
0	AMD's processor heats up too much, and the graphics card does not seem to support the translucent effect of VISTA. The effect is greatly reduced, and its performance is also low. If there is an intel+nidia version, it will be perfect. 
1	Frankly speaking, the hotel is better than I expected. It belongs to the better category in the three-star hotel. The staff has a strong sense of service, unlike inland cities. However, Ctrip's price is not competitive enough, and the soliciting guides who meet at the train station can provide better prices (the travel companions of Lu Yu tried). 
0	Advantages: Convenient transportation Disadvantages: Not in line with the four-star in my heart 1. The swimming pool of the hotel is not as beautiful as a smaller hotel. 2. In Sanya Bay, it is not Yalong Bay. There is no advantage at this price, and the corresponding requirements cannot be obtained. 3. Inconsistent with the previous evaluation, a is not so close to Chunyuan Seafood Plaza. The Golden Phoenix Square downstairs is not as good as thought. In short: I won’t be choosing next time. It's better to spend less money to stay in a small resort in Sanya Bay or spend the same money to stay in Yalong Bay with good environment. 
0	What makes me most uncomfortable is that there is no XP drive disk. It took me an afternoon to download it on the official website! 
0	G 105M graphics card is still weaker, ATI HD 4570 will be stronger. Now DDR3 memory is a bit expensive, wait for its price to come down before adding memory. 
1	Although it looks very ordinary on the surface, the decoration inside is still very exquisite, and the living is clean and comfortable; the first choice for Yixing in the future is Yixing Hotel! 
1	Nice hotel with very good service. The head of reception not only helped us with free upgrades, but also took us to the room himself. The rooms are large and comfortable, with large LCD screens, and free drinks and snacks. Soon after entering the room, the waiter made coffee, especially when we left, the waiter also helped us get some drinks to drink on the way, and also prepared two newspapers. In short, the sense of service is very strong and makes people feel very considerate. very satisfied! The only drawback is that the TV signal in one room is not very stable and not very clear. I hope it can be improved. Will choose to stay here next time. 
0	There are actually no other accessories, such as a mouse, or a bag. And it’s too hot! The GPU can reach 70 degrees Celsius casually, and the CPU should be above 60 degrees Celsius. It is worrying to use in summer 
1	I have been to Dalian before and chose to live in the Expo this year. The overall feeling is quite good, but there are many Japanese who live here, and I hate Little Japan the most. Personally, I am used to staying in a hotel. What I care most about is hygiene, especially the hygiene of the bathroom. The sanitary conditions here are satisfactory, and the service is not as bad as said. The attitude of the service staff is very friendly and there are problems quickly All were resolved, and the room was cleaned in time. The room I lived in had a better view and you could see the beautiful night view of Dalian. Next time I go to Dalian, I decided to live in this one. It’s good and good. Additional comment August 24, 2007: Another worthy one What's more, the hotel has a good location, and there are direct buses from here to major attractions and shopping areas 
1	The appearance is very beautiful. Harman/kardon? The speaker is not covered. It feels like a speaker. The system comes with office2007. 
0	The price is more expensive! The building is high, the lobby is relatively large, and the room is large enough. However, the hardware facilities are at the level of the late 1980s and early 1990s. They look old, the furniture is peeling, and the sanitary ware is the old generation of Kohler lined up, but it has no luster. The sink of the wash basin has a toothpaste cover in the sink. There is absolutely no four-star sanitary condition, and there is somebody's body hair on the newly changed sheets! The carpet in the elevator seems to be out of the original color, so don't even think about finding the spotless feeling in the room. The service was not four-star enough. The doorman watched me with my luggage indifferently and dragged my luggage away. It is estimated that he would not take the initiative to help if he was not called. The room service is not flattering. I only checked in at three o'clock in the middle of the night. As a result, the waiter knocked on the door after I fell asleep and gave me water and disposable supplies. Good spirit! But the time is not right. There is a broadband plug in the room, but I don’t know why. The location is not bad. I later figured it out. It is estimated that it was built by the oilmen and mainly used for public money consumption, so the price is expensive, the service is poor, and the hotel management is not emphasized. If you travel by yourself, live less! 
0	Without the operating instructions, the camera made me look for it. In the end, I still can't ghost. I tried many methods. I don't know if it is the sis chipset problem or other reasons. Waiting for the master! 
1	Very good hotel. There is nothing to fault. 
1	Very good hotel, I like it very much. The room is very clean and beautiful. From the window of the room, it is super beautiful. It is very convenient to travel in the city center. I will definitely stay again if I have the opportunity. 
1	The hotel is a bit old, the rooms are relatively small, but the hotel has a good seat, just by the sea, you can go swimming directly. The sea view on the 8th floor opens the window to the sea. If you want to live in a lively area, this is not a good choice, but Weihai is really small and taxis are still quite cheap. There are fewer taxis at the hotel entrance at night. 
1	"I almost finished reading Mr. Shi's book in one breath. After reading it, I felt heavy: the world was so structured, the fate of the Chinese was so rough, the world was no longer peaceful, and the stormy waves were shocking. I believe that anyone who has read this book will benefit from it. Maybe it will change your life. I believe it has changed me because ""My World"" is no longer vague. Thank you Mr. Shi, thank him for writing such a great book with all his hard work, using his unique and effective ""interest analysis method"" and a broad but detailed perspective to teach us: the world should see this way! "
0	The building is very old, the rooms are large, and the service is good. The morning tea on the second floor is good. 
0	Reading a few chapters of this book is hard to finish! The content seems to be something *** propaganda, which makes people obedient, tolerate everything, and emphasize adjusting their mood. Similar to Ah Q's self-relieving spirit. Reading this book can't make people refreshed, let alone make people motivated, and it's not like prose. In short, super work is better than the value of this book! 
1	The appearance is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, low noise, almost no noise, the keyboard is super easy to use, it is very comfortable to touch, the heat dissipation is also very good, the battery is very good, the time is really long, the video effect is very good during the day, good Like it 
0	All viewpoints are discussed in general terms, and have no practical effect. Very disappointed. What a great effect for any educated woman 
0	The power of the machine itself is not enough, and the display frequency must be connected to the power supply to see clearly. When it is unplugged, it becomes dim. gosh! 
0	The weight is still a bit heavier, and then the battery was taken out and I was shocked. The battery is too small, similar to a bamboo pole, no wonder it has a nominal 2 hours of use. But this one is still a bit thick, and the liner of a notebook I bought almost can't fit in. 
0	What makes me dissatisfied is that Jingdong’s arrival of the goods can’t help but pay immediately and prevent inspections, which is more overbearing. 
1	The HP brand is worth the price. The domestic shipment of this notebook is slower than that in the United States, and it is compact and suitable for girls. 
1	"I have always wanted to buy domestic popular science books for my son, but I didn't buy it because of the preaching taste. In fact, science should be in normal life, just like this set of books, so that children will like it soon. So later on, books on popular science were bought from abroad. At that time, when my son was 5 years old, a set of ""Encyclopedia for Chinese Children"" was given by others. The content was quite large and rigorous, but it was too boring. The child hadn't touched it for many years, and it was still new. But this set of books (1-3) has been turned over. "
1	Lightweight, the appearance is the same as the picture. I like that the charging time is 5~6 hours after actual running test. It is still long enough. The stereo sound is also very good. The Bluetooth function is more convenient to connect to the mobile phone. 
0	The maximum screen resolution is 1440*900. The font is small but very delicate. A bit tired. After adjusting to 1280*768, the fonts are not delicate. 
1	1. The overall appearance is stylish and generous, piano paint. 2. Mainstream configuration, DDRI3 generation memory. Greatly improve the running speed. 3. LED perfect screen, higher brightness, more energy saving. Longer life. 4. Dolby sound, the effect is good 
0	This book is really bad. I used to hear from Zhejiang University's teachers how this book is wrong, and I still don’t believe it. I finally bought a copy and found it really~~~ speechless, this kind of book Can be written 
1	The hotel is very cost-effective. I especially want to thank the waiter in the breakfast room. On the morning of August 2nd, I left the small bag on the chair after breakfast, and the waiter soon delivered the bag to the reception desk. Thank you very much! To praise. In the corridor When I meet the waiters, they always greet you with a smile. In short, I am very satisfied with the service of the Great World Hotel! 
0	I sent the wrong book and I still don’t know how to return it? Dangdang's after-sales service is really as bad as stated on the Internet! ! ! 
1	I like the appearance, but overall it's pretty good. I have bought it for four or five days, and no problems have been found. The driver can be downloaded from the official website, which is very fast. 
0	I've seen it from a friend, but the book I ordered hasn't arrived for half a month. I haven't received a call and it's useless. You must think about it in the future! Dangdang is too slow 
0	The battery occupies all the positions in the rear, making the interface positions in the other three directions appear more crowded. The operating system is vista, and the response speed is a bit slow. 
1	The son is six years old. Love reading, this is a gift for him on Children's Day. At noon, watching the cartoon. I said, Mom bought you a book, put it in his arms, and walked away. He glanced, then watched TV. He glanced again, never letting go. I took it with me for a meal when I went out for a whole week. Fascinated in general. Read it again and again. I found that he didn't understand all of his children's reading books, but he can still have fun. He has a unique understanding at the age of six. This is the stuff I only met in high school. 
1	"The author is merciful, the freelance writers in Shenzhen are far from being as unrestrained as ""Attempted Divorce"". In fact, Shenzhen is a typical pseudo-cultural city. There is no liberal arts college, the song and dance troupe is disbanded, and the Yue Opera troupe is disbanding. Shenzhen is not a place for literati. However, the novel is really good. So, I still highly recommend "
1	My friend asked me to buy a child’s book. I searched for it on Dangdang for a long time. It seems that there are too many good books. But this set, I was attracted by its illustrations and brief text descriptions, so I placed the order without hesitation. I hope my friend's child will like it. Sure enough, it lived up to my expectations. After I got the book last week, my friend told me that the child sleeps in these repetitive and moving stories every night and becomes her best friend next to her pillow. All the characters in the story are so cute. And vivid, so the stories are so simple but touching, children like them, and even the adults who tell stories are aroused by the childlike innocence. 
1	As a five-star hotel, all facilities are outdated, and the room size obviously does not reach the five-star standard. The speed of hotel check in is extremely slow. Arrived around 11pm and waited 15 minutes. The room rate is too expensive, except for the location factor, it is not up to the level of a five-star hotel. Breakfast is okay at the price of ctrip. The bathroom in the room is good, the water pressure is high, and the water temperature is comfortable, and it is also very large and not cramped. It is suggested that you can consider Yuehai which is not far away. 
0	The breakfast is not good, the service is not in place, there is no western food for the dinner, the breakfast and dinner are the same, the room conditions are not good, the restaurant does not have a smoking area. The rooms do not have non-smoking rooms. 
1	This book can help elementary students understand many applications of mathematics. It can arouse children's interest in mathematics more than directly letting children do math problems. 
1	The price is high, the appearance is dazzling, and it looks good in comparison. The sound is my most satisfied part, the sound effect is very good! ! 
1	The book comes with a lot of historical knowledge at the beginning. I was very impatient to read it. I didn’t think I had a good idea. It seemed very messy. But it seems that everyone has a good evaluation of this book. So be patient and read it. At the beginning of three books, I really found that I was getting better. The author began to find the feeling that the progress of things began to have some meaning. At the end I read all five books and found that I liked this set of books. It seems that I will continue to pursue it. , It’s just a pity that it’s not finished yet. I really want to see the back. I don’t know what the author will give us? 
0	I ordered the 210 standard A. The hotel lobby and the overall environment look good, but the room feels too dirty and smelly when I enter the room. I don’t even want to enter the bathroom. The so-called broadband Internet access is to provide a broadband modem. , I can’t connect at all. After waiting for nearly 2 hours, I made countless phone calls and complained, but I still couldn’t access the Internet. After talking to the lobby manager, I couldn’t access the Internet and I had to check out. I was told to take my computer to other floors. Try to transfer to that floor if you can access the Internet. After being flatly rejected, the lobby manager proposed to switch to the second floor. The second floor is the kind of broadband that everyone often uses. There is no need to connect to the electricity modem, but we need to add money. At this time, 3 hours have passed, and we can't go to the theory. , And moved to the second floor. I always thought that the room type I was changing was a standard B room. Later, when I checked out, I realized that I was staying in a deluxe room that cost more than 400. There are several budget hotels nearby that were only 180. They were clean and had internet access. The price of Xinhua is too expensive, and the price of Ctrip is not cheap at all. The standard A and standard B for other guests at the front desk are only 150 and 190 yuan. Will not stay here in the future, the surrounding hotels are much better than here. 
1	I like this book very much and finally bought it. But, unfortunately, the corners of the books delivered by Dangdang were broken and damaged. For someone who loves books and cherishes them, what I need is perfect. Do you think people who use bookmarks for reading can tolerate damage to their books? I have already wrapped the book. I hope that when I ship the book next time, I will pay attention to outsourcing and not send any damaged items. This is disrespect for our readers and disrespect for yourself. We have done 99% of the preliminary work, why should we disappoint in the end? Hope it can be improved. Thank you! 
1	Hong Kong hotels don’t need to force anything in terms of area! The facilities of this hotel are quite old, but the traffic is more convenient! Service is acceptable! 
1	I heard that it is the best hotel in Liuzhou. It turned out to be the guest house of the municipal government. It is close to a river and has a good view. The traffic is also OK. The room does not leave any special impressions, but I think the waiters in the Chinese restaurant on the ground floor have a special attitude Well, diligent, kind, and sent hot towels several times for the meal. 
1	After I got the book, I spent the whole night reading it. I have heard some comments about this novel earlier, mainly from readers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Indeed, as Zhang Ailing herself estimated, many people were busy checking their seats after reading the novel. After reading the novel, I realized that it is too difficult for people to think that this is not an autobiographical novel. But I still feel that the high literary value of this novel makes people ignore the similarities between its plot and the author's life. Zhang Ailing's vision of leaving the world, and the weak feelings of an ordinary woman, as well as the concise and incisive brushwork, can not but let people be surprised. 
1	Big brand, and it is the cheapest one in comparison of various parameters. When I got it in my hand, I found that the appearance is also very good, and there is no problem in using it. 
1	I stayed in September, more than 600 nights, the standard was simple but the front desk took the initiative to upgrade to the sea view room on the 15th floor for free, with a good attitude and a good view. In fact, it's good to live in Western District. The trams and buses are convenient and cheap. Last time I lived in Ramada nearby and I felt very good. The disadvantage is that the room is a bit old and the wallpaper doesn't feel clean. 
0	I bought it for my niece because I saw that the sales volume was very good. I didn’t know that it was my IQ problem. Anyway, I didn’t understand any foreign novels, let alone my niece’s... 
1	The hotel facilities are slightly outdated, but clean and tidy. Breakfast starts at six o'clock (very good), and there are many varieties, but the food in the Ming stalls is not available at six o'clock, which is a little regret 
1	Cost-effective, large screen, the most suitable for home in terms of size, watching movies online games is very cool, the sound is also very loud. The full keyboard is really convenient to get used to in the future. The hot place of the machine is under the numeric keypad, which is usually out of reach. With XP and Vista dual systems installed, all hardware is compatible. The drivers are all from the CD-ROM. 
1	This is the second time I stayed at this hotel this year. This time I went to HK shopping with my friends. This hotel is my first choice. Although the hotel is far from the city, there is a free shuttle bus from the Peninsula Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui (on the hour) ) Back to the hotel. The hotel room is very large, about 20 square meters. I stayed in two rooms with invincible sea view. When I checked in, I chose the room on the yacht club side. You can see the sea. In addition, the rooms below the sixth floor The room also has a terrace, which feels very good. The hotel’s breakfast is also very rich (worth a try), you can sit on the edge of the open-air garden, and take a walk in the garden after breakfast. It feels really good. Not far from the hotel is the beach. Not far from the hotel, there are also 7-11 (24-hour convenience store), a small supermarket (where fresh fruits are sold), and a restaurant that eats Southeast Asian cuisine. I don’t remember the name. The only dissatisfaction of the hotel is that the facilities in the room are relatively outdated, but the bathroom is very good, with a separate shower room. If you are a family going to HK for vacation, you can't go wrong with choosing this hotel. 
1	It feels pretty good. I stayed in a big bed room. The room was a bit small. But it was more economical. The bed was a tatami-mat type, but Simmons might not be very good, so I slept the next day and felt sore back. Give two bottles Water, some small things are also good. It is convenient in the center of Haining. 
0	Can someone tell me how to use fingerprints under XP? IBM has a software to open ACER, it seems there is also a software, but it can't be opened after it is installed, and there is no response to a call. The heat dissipation is too hot compared to my THINKPAD X200, and it is not bad compared to my COMPAQ V3803TX 
0	This original version of VISTA will definitely not work and must be upgraded, and the motherboard drivers provided by Asus are all Vista drivers, there is no XP system driver, ask the customer service can only go to the official website, go to the official website to open the page, refresh multiple times, open it By luck. If it is not pre-installed, customers can choose to buy it, too lazy! 
0	The hotel is the worst that Ctrip introduced. The breakfast is very poor. A large group of waiters sitting aside picking their noses, putting on make-up and talking loudly, disgusting! Additional comments November 6, 2006: There are no small beds in the big room, and the facilities are simple. 
0	When I checked in, I emphasized not to stay in a room near the window, but when I rested at night, I found myself living on the road. When I fell asleep at one o'clock in the morning, loud car horns came from outside the window, and it was continuous. Drivers in Lhasa frequently honked their horns at one o'clock. 　　 You can hear people talking loudly on the street and the shops downstairs are closed in bed. sound. My God, nightmare! immediately asked to change the room, and agreed quickly, there are other rooms vacant! They left the rooms in good condition vacant, but arranged the guests in the rooms near the road! Really hateful 
0	I bought it only after the hype was so hot. The so-called greater hope, the greater the disappointment. This is probably what I mean. It's a bit like an article in a magazine like readers. 
1	Before I checked in, I was still a little disturbed after reading the reviews above. After moving in, I feel okay. In Wuhu this place, it should be said that it is good to be able to live in such a hotel. Will choose this hotel in Wuhu in the future. 
0	The room is not bad, big enough, but there are signs of mildew on the head of the bed, the price of 218 yuan is still too expensive 
0	The hotel is not up to the star standard at all. It was run by the local industrial and commercial bureau. It is estimated that it is the original guest house. I just stayed the night before. The outdoor temperature is -3 degrees, and the indoor temperature will not exceed 10 degrees. The air conditioner is turned off at 12 o'clock in the evening, and the internet speed is very slow. According to the local consumption level, the standard room is at most 120 yuan. The reservation price of Ctrip is 180 yuan, which is not worth it! Breakfast is poor! 
1	Nice hotel, good location, just out of the train station. The first floor is a bit noisy, there are tour groups and guests for dinner, but it does not affect the accommodation 
0	"After reading it, the printed book is quite exquisite, but the content: the mumbling of the kimchi woman is very ordinary! The overall feeling of this book is ""not as famous as meeting each other."" It is recommended to go online to download a copy and just watch it, don’t buy it. "
1	The battery really lasted for more than nine hours of standby, and it was used for about seven hours. rare. The workmanship is fine, the battery design is reasonable, and the keyboard typing is relatively smooth, perhaps because of my small hands. The microphone reception is not bad. In addition to the so-called 3G, the functions are relatively complete, even if the quality is average, at least it has the functions as a second computer, portable enough, of course, except for the optical drive, and the game is free. Regarding the problem of small words, it can just limit your online time, which is also an advantage, haha. 
1	Very good, 3699, great value, the sis board is not as bad as everyone thinks. Generally enough. 
1	The room equipment is too broken, even the sprinklers are not working well, and the air conditioner can hardly feel it. Although I turned on the biggest one, the other thing is that the equipment is not repaired in time. The overall feeling is that the service is okay, the level of equipment in the guest house... 
1	The location of the hotel is very suitable for summer vacations, the hardware facilities are less than 5 stars, the service is up to standard, the breakfast buffet is relatively simple, and it is more difficult to hit. 
0	For the first time I stayed in a so-called 3-star hotel like this, I would also like to say a few words. . . The blue sky is really bad, the room level is still good, but the service attitude is simply rubbish; the broadband is not working well, it just can't be used at night, I asked it and said it was out of order; I ordered a portion of Italian beef powder for lunch I almost didn’t vomit it out; I was busy with socializing during the day and came back after signing the agreement. The phone rang N times during the night of sexual harassment. Speaking of irritating things: check out in the morning, the general service desk contacted the floor, the first floor said I drink With mineral water, I will tell the front desk that there is nothing in the room, is it possible? Then the floor said I drank Coke? ? ? Fainted. . . On the third floor, it said I had removed the condom box in the bathroom? ? ? ? ? ? I almost got angry. . . When I got hot, I asked what is going on. Is it a 3-star hotel like you? ? Later, I installed a sample and checked it and said that it was the residents who spent on July 5th. . . Ha ha. . . It took a full 20 minutes to figure it out. At the same time, my friend who drove me to the airport stood there for 20 minutes to watch. . . Really sweating. . . 
1	The cover is beautiful and the paper is good, but it takes a long time to send it. 
0	The manual is simple and the software that comes with the disk does not specify what to use. I don’t know when I install it. If I don’t install it, some shortcut keys won’t work. If I install it, I don’t know which one is. 
0	When I received the book, I looked at it and found it to be general. I feel that I have extracted and sorted out various Chinese medicine books and processed it in my own language, and the writing is very rough, like talking casually. Like a book. Regret buying! I don’t know what the author’s job is, but as far as this book is concerned, it’s very unprofessional. Maybe it’s a writer addiction that anyone can publish a book after thinking about it! 
1	This book was recommended by our colleagues, and it is now in the hands of the company! If it is the first time to raise a baby, there will be unexpected gains. The important thing is to teach you to pay attention to your baby’s personality, protect your baby’s personality, how to avoid misunderstandings in nursing, how to grasp the condition first, and how to solve the problem in the first time. How to foresee and protect your baby's safety. If you are bringing your baby by yourself, you will feel confident to handle it, which is unexpected in your opinion, but it is a very natural physiological situation for the baby. After experiencing it, you will fall in love with this book! 
1	The process design and workmanship are good, the battery, wireless, and heat dissipation are excellent. The performance of the CPU N280 exceeds my expectations and is sufficient for general applications. The quality of ASUS is okay, and it is worth spending a few hundred yuan more for this. 
0	Haitian’s room is relatively small, because it’s in the middle, so the lighting is not very good, the facilities inside are not good, the carpet is dirty, the hot water pipe in the room I lived in is broken, but because the roommate was already asleep at the time, So I didn't change it, but I was in a bad mood. What I disliked the most was their service attitude. Because we were sorting things, we got down 15 minutes late. During this period, there was no call to remind us that we must get down immediately, but they kept questioning when we got to the front desk: Why did we get down so late? ,! The tone was very bad, and I was asked three times. The lady at the front desk asked twice, her face was stinky. Later, a man who didn't know if it was the front desk with a cigarette in his mouth, asked us again. I felt very hot at the time. I have stayed in so many hotels and I have never seen anyone questioning guests. I will never go to this hotel again. 
0	The content of the story is a bit deep. You can only understand it after going to elementary school like Galileo and Columbus, but the chicks in the story are still very cute. Although the daughter can’t understand, she likes chicks very much. 
0	Checking in on the 27th was just in time for the nearby construction. The first impression was not good. When I left on the 29th, there was a piano and violin performance in the lobby. When booking (large/double), I didn’t have to choose. When I checked in, I was told that there were two luxury double rooms, but I actually wanted one big and one pair. In short, it is not satisfactory. 
1	The Wizard of Oz has no gorgeous words, thrilling storylines, and no complicated emotional descriptions. What she has is a pure innocence. It is a fairy tale that children can read with gusto and make it easy for adults to miss the past. While reading the Wizard of Oz, scenes appeared in my mind, just like the cartoons I watched when I was a child, the scenes were relaxed and smooth. It feels great to read it every night before going to bed! However, this book only has two parts: Wonderland Magician and Grinda, and there is no story in the middle. I think it is still unfinished when I read it... 
0	Jingdong’s packaging should be more skinny. When it was delivered, it was wrapped in a packaging box, which looked very distressing. 
1	"As soon as the story came up, I met a Faqiu expert. I don't know if it was a special arrangement by the author. I always unconsciously compare this book with the ghost blow series. And Faqiu happened to be a race that Ba Chang didn't mention. But as soon as he came up, he got Fatty Wang out. Later I discovered that this was still one of the protagonists. I have to think that ""Sanshu"" will not be a doujin. It's unicorn blood, which is refreshing for me. That kind of bronze product also runs through the entire story line. I hope Wu Xie, the first brother, can take us to another unknown area and have a spiritual spa. "
0	Disappointed! I thought it was a book with specific reading content! There was no result at all! I flipped it a bit and threw it aside! Failed purchase! 
1	Although I have bought the D80 for a long time, I have been stuck at the level of ordinary photography. Not long ago, I was really ashamed to read my friend's work, so I wanted to find a book to improve myself. This is an introductory guide for the basic principles/structure/operation of SLR cameras, photographic composition, portrait/landscape/documentary strategy. After reading the whole article, I felt that there was a lot of profit, so I picked up the camera and got it up. It really improved a lot for a small test of the cow machine. My friends said the work was good, so proud, haha! Make persistent efforts and continue to study hard, hoping to catch up with the amateur middle and advanced level (hope so). 
1	First time staying at Ningfeng Hotel, located in the city center, shopping is very convenient. The decoration of the rooms is stylish and warm, the supplies are clean and comfortable, and there are flowers and fruits as gifts. It feels like home and the service is warm and thoughtful. The only shortcoming is the road repair at the door, but I heard that it can be repaired on May 1st. After staying, they said: the same service, they are more pleasantly surprised; the same smile, they are more sincere! 
0	Although the author is not a professional medical staff, he can be regarded as a doctor! The content of this book is full of self-boosting and swelling. I think this should not be the subject of the book and what the readers need in the first place! The simplicity of this book is a major feature, but it has a major hidden danger in itself-it does not take into account the differences in the physical constitution, regional climate, and habits of the readers involved, and uses a single model to solve all problems. The problem is obviously undesirable! I purchased this book because of Dangdang’s recommendation rankings, but it didn’t take long to read it. At least I couldn’t agree with it. I hope that the author, as a doctor, will be clear and understandable and understandable for readers. While complimenting the self, it also does not forget to spread its differences and basic knowledge so that readers can correctly and conveniently grasp the knowledge that is beneficial to them. It won't be a thousand miles away because of the slightest loss, I think this should be the original intention of the author! 
0	I don’t like LED backlight very much, the color looks uncomfortable, but ordinary CCFL is better (CCFL 5.6 inches, display 1024 x 600, better than 8.9 LED backlight) 
0	Maybe men and women in the United States are different from those in China? For a person with rich life experience, many things in this book are not very practical. The only practical advice is: always remember that men and women are two completely different creatures. 
0	VISTA system outdated failed! Just toss about the partition. The appearance is greatly lost, and those who preach beautiful or satisfied appearance are definitely fooling you! The plastic feel is strong, and the smell comes out after opening the package; there is no gold plating; the display is too short to be used to it; the painted surface is easy to get dirty! The battery is similar to second-hand! 
1	The price-performance ratio of this netbook is quite good. I have tested this netbook very carefully when I went home. For notebooks with a price of less than 2000, the performance of this u100x is already super good. It was snapped up in 1999, and other brands of similar configurations are at least 500 expensive. Good workmanship, very light notebooks, and can be overclocked. I like it very much. 
0	The reading value of this book need not be questioned, it is a good book. But the quality of this book sent by Dangdang.com is very poor! By the second day of reading, the binding in the middle was loose, and now, more than a dozen pages have fallen out. It's irritating. I didn't expect Dangdang to have such poor quality books. 
0	The piano paint is easy to leave fingerprints and cannot enter the system. The sound is very loud when it is turned on. I have already sent it back for a replacement. I hope that Jingdong can send it back for me soon, although I encountered such bad luck the first time I bought something on Jingdong. , But still believe in Jingdong, and hope you do better. 
1	The overall performance is good, but the 9300M written in the introduction is actually 105M, and the graphics card has been upgraded. . . Let me drive for nothing. . . 
0	The Hongzhan building booked by Ctrip during the November period is said to be a four-star hotel on the Internet. It doesn’t look like it when I go to the place. Ask the waiter if this is a four-star hotel? She said, yes, and pointed to the four red five-stars cut out of red tape on the door. This is four stars, I am faint. The lobby staff explained that the Guest House is a four-star hotel, and the Hongzhan Building is an annex building. There is no four-star. The room is large, the equipment is very old, and the bed linen is very old. But the price is not expensive, 178 per day. The breakfast was not very good, the milk did not taste milk, and the tableware was not too clean. However, this hotel should not be underestimated. There is a picture album in each room, which is full of Zhu Rongji, Li Peng, and Jing Shuping. Additional comments October 7, 2007: Hotel parking fees are charged, this is the first time I encountered. 
0	Not a high score screen~ but you can't ask for too much! The price is there! It feels good to watch the movie at 15.4! There are fewer ports! The plastic is rough! 
1	The name is very loud, but the facilities are not very good, especially the single double room, there is no quiet room. Had to change to a double room after moving in. 
1	Although the signboard is changed, it is basically a change of soup and not medicine. I should not stay again next time, the price is average. Hotel feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support to this hotel! Recently, the hotel has launched a new guest room promotion on weekends. We will continue to maintain the 5-star service standard. Welcome you to stay again and sincerely wish you good health and smooth work! 
0	"The lobby of the hotel is like the lobby on the first floor of a residential apartment. The bedroom of the so-called ""suite"" is smaller than any five-star standard room I have ever stayed in. The two beds are close to each other within half a meter. The annoying thing is that the bathroom is so small that two people can fight in it! This is the most rubbish suite I have ever stayed in. It even sold for 807 yuan a night, which is really worthless for the RMB! Such a hotel under the Howard Johnson Group of the United States really smashed its own signature! Ctrip, please carefully examine the true situation of each customer that signed the agreement, and don't let Ctrip's loyal customers be deceived again and again! Additional review June 16, 2008: A very disappointing hotel with low cost performance!

1	If this book is made into a movie, it is recommended that Cecilia Cheung play the role of Chang Gong. What do you guys think? 
1	It is a very affordable hotel with convenient transportation and spacious rooms. There is no telephone harassment at night. I stayed twice, once I stayed in room 501. The bathroom was not well drained. Maybe it was an individual problem. The quality of service is very good, the broadband was not adjusted when I first checked in, and the waiter quickly helped solve it. 
0	The hotel has a peculiar smell, no air conditioning, and the overall feeling is very shabby, it can not be called a four star 
0	Personally feel that it is not worth buying. I don't like this messy painting method. Most of those who like this book are women who live in a single life. It is not so much that they like this book as they like the attitude conveyed by the author. The single life resonates with everyone. 
1	Dear Sharpei. so cute. Although the book I got is different from what I imagined. I thought it was about the size of an ordinary book. What I got was also a boxy book. However, the overall feeling is pretty good. In the text, he talked about the knife and Shar-pi with a touch of sadness and melancholy. A love that everyone envy. Sharpi's image is very cute, and the confused big eyes in the circle of eye patterns look straight into your heart. For no reason, he felt a little pity. That little spot in the crowd, can we not. I like the Mona Lisa whose face is the moon, quiet and peaceful. 
1	Before <Devil-Haunted World>, the title does not seem to be displayed. 
1	"I recommend everyone to get to know a Satya first, and you can take a look at her ""Sati La Meditation"". This is a very popular book for people who want to grow and know themselves. It reveals tolerance and love. After reading it, you will understand what kind of message she wants to convey. Then look at the book ""Family Therapy Mode"", you may have a deeper experience, in fact, when you decide to read this book, you already have a desire, that is to make yourself happy and make your family happy. So, give it a try, a choice you won't regret. "
0	The decoration of the room is a bit old, the soundproofing is poor, and there is no broadband Internet access. The service is in compliance with the regulations. Nothing special. I feel that the guests are complicated and there are nuisance calls. 
1	The hotel facilities are OK, breakfast is OK, and the location is very convenient. We stayed in a business computer room, which is equipped with a computer, and the Internet speed is very fast. The room is very small, and the computer desk is very close to the bed. You can't even walk when you are using the computer. The bathroom is transparent, suitable for couples and couples~~. 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
0	I booked a room for 2 nights with my friend. The waiter said that he hadn't booked 2 nights the next morning and asked to check out. The attitude was extremely bad. My friend was worried and contacted me many times. 
1	This book is very good, not only from the design specifications of the subway, but also gives a lot of introduction to the details of the subway tunnel. For me, it is very helpful. We have mastered more basic specifications for the secondary lining of railway tunnels, as well as the basic steps and theories of geological radar detection. This book provides comprehensive knowledge and specifications for subway tunnel inspection. If you are engaged in the detection of railway tunnels, if you are engaged in the detection of geological radar, then please refer to this book, and you will definitely benefit from it. 
0	The decoration of the A shell is not smooth, and the function keys are floating when the finger is pressed. The screen should be upgraded to an LED screen. The 4-cell battery is really not very durable. The maximum performance is only one hour, and the others are nothing. It's not good anymore. 
1	"The child laughed at it, and the adult read a book that was thoughtful. After getting the book, I was a little disappointed. If the paper is too thin, the words and pictures on the back will affect the reading on the front. In addition, the picture is not as good as ""Little Naughty Bag Nicholas"". The picture in front of each unlucky story is the same. And each story in the little naughty bag has different vivid comics, and the content is also very interesting. The only thing is that the characters in this book are larger, and the characters in the little mischievous bag are smaller. It looks harder for children, and it is suitable for adults to read to him. "
0	This small hotel is also really bad, the sanitary conditions are very poor, there is no hot water bath after arriving at night, the equipment is outdated, the sink is full of rust spots, and the toilet corner dirt is everywhere. This can be tolerated or dealt with overnight. As Ctrip.com, it has been in operation at Tianjin New International Airport for almost half a year, and it still highly recommends this small hotel far away from the airport. It can be seen within walking distance, which is the most incomprehensible. I wanted to book a hotel close to the airport on June 25. I booked this hotel on Ctrip. It said it was an airport hotel. The recommender said that it was a few hundred meters away from the airport. But I took flight CA1396 on June 26. After getting off the plane at 3 a.m. on the 27th, when taking the airport bus, the bus administrator said that he could not go to this small hotel, then I would take a taxi. I asked 7 cars, and they all said they could not go to this small hotel. Going, I finally found out that this small hotel is a product of the original broken airport. It is 8 kilometers away from the new international airport where I got off the plane. The airport bus does not pass through here. The taxi is too close, making little money, so I don’t go. , It was still raining heavily, so I called this small hotel and no one answered. What can I do? . At this time, the airport bus was gone. There was no way. I took a taxi and went to the city. It cost 58 yuan. Another taxi was taken to the hotel. At this time, it was already light. As a result, Ctrip's information was not updated, which caused me to spend more money and wasted time. It is recommended that Ctrip immediately delete this small hotel from the hotel list. 
1	I booked through Ctrip and stayed for 3 days. I feel that the price and the room are quite different. The room is outdated, the bathroom is small, especially the TV set. It is estimated that there is no such TV in the guest houses in Chengdu. The breakfast is good, the service is not appreciated. The room price should be about 158 yuan per room. 
1	The hotel has a good location and convenient transportation. Although the hardware environment seems relatively old, it still does not lose its grade. The service attitude is basically satisfactory. The broadband network speed is good, but you also need to contact the front desk to open an account without any prompts, which is not convenient. A mosquito killer is prepared in the room, but there are no pills. You need to contact the waiter to get it. The breakfast on the day of departure was not ideal. Before the end time (one hour away), while we ate, the waiter took away all kinds of tableware and dishes nearby, which made us feel embarrassing. Also, see in the bathroom 
1	The cost performance is high, and the appearance is very unique. The official website also provides an xp driver, and the installation of xp is very simple. The system runs smoothly. The system was installed yesterday. Today I copied a few games and went back to see the effect. The 15.4-inch body can accommodate more keys. It is more convenient to use. 
1	I promised to buy a computer package for the first time, but it has been almost a month since the disaster has been eliminated, and I have not sent it yet, and I am ready to return it. It is dishonest. In the future, you must buy everything to pay 
1	1. Good heat dissipation performance 2. The multimedia touch buttons are innovative and easy to operate 3. The touchpad is sensitive, the notebook is well made, and the appearance is good 
0	"The most recent order number is 1442083355. One set of books ""The Wisdom of the Book of Changes"" Dangdang.com has few CDs. In order to get a solution, I wrote twice, and no one responded in two or three days. Then I call [08/1/04 1:30] 010-51236699 customer service hotline, the extension is 3037. Reflect the situation. Dangdang's response was disappointing and asked me to send the book back in full for replacement. Said that no matter where everyone is treated like this. I said it’s so much trouble, can’t you send over the tape you forgot to bring. Dangdang said, no. Such a small matter, such a treatment, personal feeling, shopping on Dangdang, no trouble, as soon as it appears, you are unlucky! I don't plan to ask for the CD, and I won't send the book back, because their attitude makes me worry. I am unlucky. I just consider not buying books online in Dangdang in the future. "
1	The screen is big and the configuration is okay. The 250GSATA hard drive should be right soon, but the BIOS shows IDE. You can turn off the camera and wireless with one button, which feels very convenient 
1	Beautiful, even the adapter is small and exquisite, it is also white, it looks good~ the screen brightness is quite high, and it is the brightest and dazzling at night~ The battery life is not that long, about 5 hours, but it is enough. 
1	Go to the self-pickup point and take it back and take it apart. The notebook is small in size, the six-cell battery has a long battery life, the brushed metal shell has first-class workmanship and feel, and the keyboard typing is smooth and comfortable. No matter how long it is on, it won't be hot, and the fan sound is so soft that it is almost inaudible. The screen is very beautiful and beautiful, the battery is very durable, can last for six hours, basically meet the needs of going out 
1	It has the same hand feel and almost the same use experience as the T series. Although there is no fingerprint recognition, it is not a gimmick. The maximum brightness of the screen is very bright, white is very white, and there is no blue or yellow phenomenon. No dead pixels have been seen yet. After using for a period of time, the hand rest did not increase significantly. 
1	After installing ASUS OEM XP, it turns out that LINUX does a good job, but who can use it? After a trial, I completely deleted the hard drive and made it again. The whole process went smoothly, and I couldn't choose SATA or IDE in BIOS. I installed all kinds of commonly used office software, etc. I didn’t feel slow. I tried CS and it can run up to 30-40 frames per second at the lowest resolution. HD movies are really not smooth. The battery is really great. 8700mAh, just think about it. At least 5-6 hours, some other brands of similar products have cheaper, but the battery is also very common, ASUS's design is indeed clearly positioned! 
1	The driver is very well installed, and it is available on the official website. I bought a Samsung DDR2-667 1G memory, and I felt good after using it all afternoon. 
0	The biggest disadvantage of this hotel is: noisy! The big speakers on the opposite side have been playing during the day, and there is a restaurant inside it! Almost no rest during the day! 
0	Plastic shell, short battery time, messy keyboard layout, in short, I used to use Thinkpad before, and it feels that the grade is down 
0	If you don't send the package, it feels like a fly in the ointment, but the original Lenovo package that you spend dozens of dollars on is pretty good! There was a problem with the seal when the package arrived. The courier said it was dropped when it was mentioned. I think the original package seal of Lenovo is not very good, and there is no problem yet~~~~~~~ 
1	1 The overall workmanship is fine. 2 White is basically not troublesome with fingerprints. This is the main reason why I choose white. 3 The keyboard feels good; the touchpad's multi-point function will surprise you. 4 The battery life is really strong, very satisfied. 5 cpu It's not as bad as expected, and it's definitely enough for daily copywriting work and the Internet. The mainstream numerical calculation software matlab can be installed and run smoothly, and the calculation speed is half slower than that of the mainstream cpu (when overclocking) 6 mainstream video playback is very smooth 7 changing the xp system is easy. eeebuntu system should be better, to be tried 
1	It has beautiful appearance and excellent performance. It can run high-definition videos and current mainstream games smoothly. In the same size model, weight and heat are better controlled. 
1	"I received the book, the cover is good PP, and the texture is so good, I like it very much. O(∩_∩)O~ After reading it in one go, this book is very well written. Haha, I like Su Xiaoyu and Chen Sulei, and I also like that dear little fish's poem. The male protagonist in the story is very similar to the male protagonist in the movie ""Beautiful Lady in Wind and Moon"" regardless of career and life background. I have seen the author's ""Queen's Evolution"", ""Escape from Love"" and ""Marrying Money"", they are all good Yeah! A man and his card are not all women want! That's great. If women are independent and self-reliant, what financial turmoil would they be afraid of? "
1	Go out from Hongjie Railway Station and go to the Crossing Bus Station. Take bus No. 101 or 104 to Queen's Road West and you can reach the entrance of the hotel. The fare is less than 10 Hong Kong dollars. There is also a station on Nedon Road. The traffic to the hotel is actually very convenient. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to Central and Wan Chai every hour. You can go to Admiralty MTR Station, Wan Chai Ferry, Airport Express Central Station, Hong Kong Macau Ferry and other places. Drivers can also park at locations along the road. It’s easy to talk and can help with luggage. It’s actually very convenient to go to other places from the hotel. It is only two yuan to take the Star Ferry from the pier to Tsim Sha Tsui. The facade of the hotel is small, but the interior decoration is indeed a four-star in Hong Kong. Although the room is not too big, it does not seem too cramped to put two double beds. It is also very practical to change the floating platform into a seat design. , The bathroom is also quite good, the basic supplies are relatively complete except for toothbrush and toothpaste. The service of the hotel can get a perfect score. After all, it is an international chain hotel. Although it is a budget hotel, the software is still quite good. The surrounding area of ​​the hotel is actually very convenient for shopping and eating. It is not a remote place as mentioned in some reviews, but a busy commercial street. Although there is no view outside the standard room window, it is quiet. The price I took was 506, which is quite satisfying with such a low price. 
1	I got to know the author of the book on Pretty Pretty, so I bought her book on Dangdang. It was a low ebb in my life, when I was in a bad mood. When I saw this book, first of all her beautiful design attracted me and made me pleasing to the eyes. When I read it, it was like reading an illustration book when I was a child. , The author's writing style is exquisite, giving a kind of intimacy. At night when I have insomnia, I use the color meditation thoughts mentioned in the book, and I really quickly enter the dream. I slowly brought color into my life, and my mood gradually became better, and I passed the low period. 
1	The room is OK, but the hardware facilities are deviated and the service level is average. 
1	The hotel is very close to the sea, and you can see the sea from the room on the 4th floor. But it is too far from the railway station and the coach station, and the traffic is not very convenient. I asked the waiter if I needed to book a taxi for check-out around 6am the day before. The waiter said that there was no need to book a taxi at any time, but the next morning, I waited for a long time at the hotel entrance in the cold wind before I got the taxi. 
1	It may be because there are roads around, so there are fewer people, and the environment is very good and quiet. I stayed in a standard room with a large bed. The room has sufficient heating, the bathroom is good and large, and the water temperature is good. The room is clean, the space is large, and the room is high. , The bed is also very comfortable and there is no harassment on the phone. The only drawback is that the TV is too small. . 
1	"After I placed the order, my baby and I reviewed both the first series at home. When I took the new book back on Monday, the baby was very happy and told me, Mom, it’s a good day for you to work. Buy me such a good book. The pictures and stories of the book are very good. The baby always let me read it to her. When the little fox's head is covered by a big shoe in ""I Don't Want to Be Eaten"", the baby is very happy and has fun. , After telling the original story, I always turn over that page for me to tell it again. The stories are wonderful, and adults think they are very beautiful, haha! "
0	The room is good, but the quality of service is very low, and the waiter is stiff and indifferent. Stayed for two nights, although most of the time was out, but I did not watch the waiter's eyes less, as if the condition of the taxi under consultation also disturbed the hotel Noble waiter. 
0	"In order to facilitate the transportation, the mayor's building was chosen. I thought the Mayor Building was a relatively new hotel, but I felt disappointed as soon as I walked in—the lobby is super small (it should be said that there is no lobby, the building looks good in appearance but terrible inside). The carpet in the room is also very old. What is even more annoying is that when I booked online on Ctrip, I saw that the Superior Suite had breakfast for two. But when I checked in, because I was the only one, the front desk only gave me a breakfast voucher. I questioned, and the front desk replied that ""you must register two people's certificates to give two breakfast coupons."" I said that I have stayed in many hotels in China and I have never heard of such unreasonable requests. And Ctrip's booking instructions did not indicate such a requirement. The lady at the front desk replied ""This is what our hotel stipulates"" (not even a word of sorry). It's disgusting! The impression is too bad, I will not consider staying at this hotel next time! "
0	There are countless bookings from Ctrip, but this one really doesn't appreciate it. An enzymatic smell started from the corridor, and so did the room. And the windows are sealed. The most hateful thing is that the clearly booked room includes two breakfasts, and the front desk only gives one meal coupon, and also said that if you want another one, the diners must register with their ID. I rely on, when China wants to eat food, ID cards are required. I spent two shares, so why should I only give one. For my other copy, I tore up the meal coupon and threw it away. This hotel is really overbearing, stay away from it in the future. 
0	"Very, very ordinary hotel, unable to compare with Home Inns or Motels, it is actually called an environmentally friendly budget hotel, sweat. The first time I saw a gas water heater in a room, it was a ""forward"" one, the kind that made a roaring noise after it was turned on! ! ! The bed is uncomfortable, the cushion will move, and the blanket. . . Old blankets, I haven’t seen Le for ten years. The only compliment is the location, there are plenty of food and drink nearby. "
1	Be flexible and not be too rigid! You still have to use your brain to memorize words. Different words use different methods, such as root affixes, joint thoughts, homophony, and inverse methods. 
1	Daily use is really good, much better than netbooks. The speed is very fast, the noise is small, and the heat is average. The volume is OK for home use 
1	The main reason is that the rooms are very good. The co-process has booked a deluxe room of less than 400, and also gave a fruit plate. The only downside is that the room is a bit old. It is said that there is a new Shangri-La in the surrounding area, so there should be a relatively affordable price to attract people. 
1	The machine is not bad, nothing was found, it was bought at the 4599 special price. One day later, it is now 100 yuan cheaper, and I feel very uncomfortable. 
0	1. The keyboard needs to be improved; 2. The battery is 3-core; 3. The power cord is too thick! With a power supply of only 40W, do I need such a thick cable? You can go to boil water! Increase costs in vain! The main thing is to increase the weight! Weakened the advantages of the netbook's lightness! 4. After-sales service of MSI notebook is too poor 
1	"I've been watching ""Guru Guru Zhuan"" before, and the kids like it very much. After a week, I always look at it and talk by myself. The second ""Skerry's Most Popular Stories"" came out. Beibei was very excited. He told the story two or three times before and after, and the articles he was interested in were told countless times. Mr. Magnum, the talking bread, Officer Murphy these are what he often talks about. The stories are vivid and the pictures are in place. These two books are really good. "
0	The hotel is really bad, the rooms are small and dirty, the bathroom environment is too bad, the whole hotel is a bit like a guest house on the side of the road. 
0	The mute shortcut key does not work, sometimes it is mute, and sometimes the IE browser is opened, the touch screen is hot, and you can fry eggs on it. Jingdong people are very dishonest in doing business. The GL40 chipset is not marked, and I think it is G45. Deceived, garbage in GL40 garbage, typical entry-level notebook! 
0	I like this book very much and I can learn some lessons from it. Lala is a lucky person. In addition to her own efforts, the reason for her success is that she has great opportunities and some kind guides. The reality is like this. Even if you put in your efforts, you may not get a good return. But if you work hard, you will succeed when the opportunity comes. Don't complain about unfairness, life is unequal. Simple life, Simple heart. Recommend friends who just entered the workplace to read this book, there will be a lot of gains. 
0	The place is bad, the breakfast can be compared to the US guest house, the quality of the waiters is very poor, and I will definitely not go to the second time 
1	Not bad, it should meet the three-star standard, not too expensive, it may be the contract price with Ctrip! 
0	There are also shortcomings: 1. The weight is not light, don't look at it, it is quite heavy, it feels similar to my THINKPAD; 2. The screen frame design is not good-looking, too wide like a large mold with a small screen; 3. The beautiful paint loves to stay Fingerprints are a dilemma between aesthetics and practicality; 4. The bottom temperature is not low, and it is hotter in summer when it is placed on the leg. 
0	"This is a worthless book. Do you need to explain such a simple truth? Moreover, the explanation is not wonderful. It is a popular product and has a reputation. After reading this book, the author is at this level, and the author ""Zhuangzi"" is determined not to buy it. "
0	I took a look and it was not very useful. The author seems to be a non-professional person, and his amateur writing is published on the Internet, which deserves encouragement. 
1	The room can have a view, very good~~mainly it is very convenient. Going out is Pacific Plaza, a very prosperous area 
0	Personally feel that it is not worth buying. I don't like this messy painting method. Most of those who like this book are women who live in a single life. It is not so much that they like this book as they like the attitude conveyed by the author. The single life resonates with everyone. 
0	The installed LINUX system is not used to it. Refitting the WINDOWS system, and there is no driver under the WINDOWS system, you need to find it yourself, and installing the driver also requires a certain order, which is more troublesome. Another is that the heat dissipation is relatively large. 
0	I don't like his article, it's meaningless, I regret buying it. When he wrote the paragraph with Zhang Ailing, he quite knows how to avoid the important and ignore it, hypocritical. 
0	It seems that this type is not in my taste, it is a bit complicated, it may be like life, but I like the simpler. You have to draw so much to make a dish, and I thought it was a recipe 
1	My baby recently started to look at the names under each maze. It is a good way for him to recognize words, and I am glad to cooperate. There are not many words, usually two nouns and one verb. This format is easy for children to remember. Hehe, pay attention and learn! 
0	I bought it back. I wanted to see it for myself before telling it to my child, but the pungent smell has already caused a headache, so I didn't dare to show it to my child! 
0	The service was so bad, I took away the curtains in my room without telling me, and even if I called, I didn’t change it. 
0	Regarding this check-in situation, I don’t want to spend too much space on this comment. I just briefly talk about the situation. I hope that Ctrip will encounter such a situation in the future, and it will start a quick response mechanism to avoid delays in the itinerary. Because it is a night flight, I am I arrived at the hotel at two o'clock in the morning. I was exhausted and came to the hotel at the scheduled time. It took ten minutes to call at the front desk before someone came out from behind, and I still couldn't sleep. After I gave my name, she said I couldn't find out that I was a room reserved by Ctrip, but then I said there was a room, so I checked in as soon as possible. After staying for two days, when I checked out, it was 80 yuan more than the 198 room I booked. The explanation was that there was no 198 at the time, so I gave me this room type. The room type I lived in was called a business double room, which was only about 5 square meters! I asked if there is any smaller than this? The answer is yes, right away Fainted!~~~~~~~~ The final result of the coordination is that I waited for two and a half hours and called Ctrip six or seven calls before it was resolved.The problem was resolved, but it was quite unpleasant. 
1	Cheap and good value for money. Breakfast: relatively monotonous. 
1	Generally speaking, it is very good. I went to the buffet on the 39th floor at noon and took the children with me. Before entering the door, I knew that our children had to pay half of the cost. But the children’s tastes are more picky, and they basically didn’t eat anything. The hotel took the initiative to waive the children’s fees during checkout. Although it was only more than 100 yuan, it showed that the waiter paid a lot of attention to each guest. But the feature of butler service is not very obvious, that is, an extra button is added on the phone. Many other hotels also provide this service. 
0	The service is okay, the hardware conditions are average, it is very noisy, don't live if you want a good night's sleep; the train station has already moved, it is not convenient to take the train, but it is very convenient to eat at night. Hehe, I only stayed for one night and ran away. . . 
1	The breakfast was plentiful. The service staff was good. But when I checked in, I found that there was water in the bathroom. The housekeeping did not find the result and thought it was caused by our children. I was in a bad mood. There was water in the bathroom within half an hour after drying, they could only call Maintenance staff, it turns out that one of the water bucket connectors is broken. I'm sorry. Check in & check out is quicker. The Italian restaurant tastes good and the service is good. The price is about the same as Shanghai. The sea view on the 4th floor is not good enough, it should be better to go upstairs. Not convenient enough to get to Harbour City and Canton Road 
0	After using the QQ10 yuan gift voucher, I was so curious to see if the gift voucher could be used after the order was cancelled, and even said that it can't be used! 10 yuan for hard-earned! ! ! ! It was so ruined! If you don't return my money, you will have nowhere to go! ! ! ! ! ! He even said that he would not go to work on Saturdays and Sundays! Return my 10 yuan gift voucher, and I will buy something, if I don’t return it, I’ll be with you! This group of pig brains did not give much consideration to customers when the system was set up! 
0	The frame is too big, and the volume is a bit larger and heavier than the ordinary netbook, but it is within the acceptable range. Non-professional LINUX exchange XP is a bit troublesome 
1	Beautiful, I like the appearance, I think the noise is well controlled in the office, I can hardly hear it, and I don’t know how it is at night 
0	There is no mouse. Fortunately, I have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which works well. The sound of hard disk seeks can be heard when it is quiet, and it is slightly hot for long running time. 
1	The price is very affordable, but the configuration is not affordable at all. I think the home laptop is already very powerful. I really like its shape and new keyboard design. The heat dissipation is okay, at least much better than those around me who recognize HP home laptops. 
1	The size and weight are just right, very easy to use. Although the test index of Atom270 is not high, the actual use effect exceeds expectations. You can see that the 1024x560 level RMVB is not stuck at all. Installing the system with an external optical drive was extremely smooth. The installation of the sound card driver does not require Microsoft patches. 
0	Bad bad bad, too bad! It is not so bad, I hope Ctrip will not recommend such hotels to me in the future! ! ! 
0	The author advocates internal regulation and distrusts cosmetics, which agrees. But the methods listed are too troublesome and the ingredients are not easy to find. Not too practical. 
0	The fingerprints on the black surface are obvious, the color temperature of the screen is quite high, the color cast is quite large, and it seems that it cannot be adjusted? It seems that you can only adjust the brightness of the screen. When the AC power is not connected, the screen is dim, and the high power consumption selection does not seem to light up. 
0	What makes people angry is that the book I bought has 17 pages missing! ! After contacting the after-sales service, I refused to deal with it because I did not find out within the replacement time specified by them within half a month! Let me find a publishing house. The funny thing is that people said that the book Dangdang sold didn't come from them at all. They couldn't be responsible for the book. How much would you lose even if you changed one? Dangdang’s after-sales service makes me feel very regretful. Different problems should be treated flexibly and just focus on the dozen yuan. How to do it well for a long time? Remind everyone, when you buy things, especially books, you must be careful. When you buy something, you must read the next page first. (This is Dangdang’s post-sales trick). Don’t be like me. It seems you have to go to a regular bookstore. Buy a regular one 
0	I don’t know how to dissipate it for a long time, and it has not been used for a long time. The attached CD does not have an XP driver, it is troublesome to download by yourself 
0	The installed VISTA system does not match the memory. XP is installed, but it seems that the restore wizard cannot be installed. 
0	1. The interface design is unreasonable, and the mouse USB is awkwardly inserted in the lower right position. The power connector is on the right side, and on the side of the optical drive. 2. The memory should be changed to 800MHz instead of 667 which seems to be now, to make full use of performance. 3. You can buy it below 4K. Xp driver should be added to the driver disk 
0	The price was too high at the time of purchase, from 3,500 to mobile phones, and now they have fallen by more than 500, so sad! Sometimes the reaction is a bit slow, but overall it is not bad! 
1	Checked in from 7/22-7/24, the room was not bad, you can see the whole sea view, and the service of the hotel is also good. However, there are still some minor flaws. The hair of the previous residents in the bathtub was not cleaned, causing the hair to float up when the water was discharged, which was disgusting. In addition, the hotel’s catering does not reach the 4-star standard, there are few choices for food, and there are few buffets to eat at night. It's not half of the usual buffet in Shanghai. 
0	The fingerprint is too depressing...I don't know how to explain the increase in the ticket when I swipe the card. I didn't explain it before the card. 
1	Stronger than the N270 CPU speed, more outstanding continuous use time, good keyboard size and feel. 
0	A colleague recommended this book to me, so I followed Dangdang hopefully to order, but after waiting for two weeks, what was sent was not the book at all. They sent the wrong product again, and I still have it after returning it. I'm quite depressed not to receive the book! 
0	It's better not to go, it's very bad, I want to change the hotel after reading it very bad, they actually asked me for the service fee. They didn't stay in the room for 2 minutes, and it solved the problem. I think I can't go next time. 
0	The power adapter is easy to burn for a long time, and the reaction speed is slow. The battery is fully charged not in the introduction of 9.5 hours, but more than 7 hours 
1	The hotel is newly renovated and the room hardware facilities are good. However, the restaurant is really bad, the serving is very slow, the price is very expensive, and the quality is poor. The 86 yuan 2 small slices of pan-fried codfish was actually smelly, so I called the restaurant manager and tried it for a long time without saying anything. In the end, it turned black and white and said it was not smelly, which is really intolerable. 
1	Very average, the rooms are small, and the furniture is outdated and old. The price-performance ratio is too bad, book one night, and then renew another night. Really dissatisfied and changed to InterContinental Hotel two days later. I will renew one day later, but it is not counted as booking through the city! It may be driven by interests. In contrast, I also set a day before renewing InterContinental. Intercontinental handled it very well. Additional comments May 20, 2008: Also, I booked a double room through Xiecheng, which became a standard room. Very unpleasant! 
1	"By the way. I hope that the TV series will be produced well. Actor selection is very important. Don't be like ""There will be an angel who loves you for me"", I am very moved by reading, and I just want to curse when it comes out on TV. I pray. "
1	The cost performance is higher, and the hardware facilities are more improved than in the past. satisfaction! 
1	The hotel service is very good, the environment is also very good, but eating in the hotel is too expensive, the corner is very off, the traffic is very inconvenient. 
0	There are no shortcomings, all advantages~~Hoho, maybe the hard disk is not enough, but with such a small notebook, the requirements are not so high~~~~~~~ 
0	Free airport pick-up car. Broadband Internet access is just a decoration. I can’t access the Internet at all. I called the front desk several times and it didn’t solve the problem. In the end, I could only use the telephone line to dial. The guest room I live in faces the highway, and the sound insulation is not good. The truck passing by in the morning is very noisy. A young lady harassed the phone at night. There is a Korean tour group on the opposite side, and the ladies come in and out frequently. I heard from my friends that the ladies there are more slaughter, and the negotiated price is only for the station fee. In the end, a tipping fee will be charged. If you don't give it, a chicken will come in and talk to you. It's very scary. It's best not to try. 
1	In my heart, Teacher Liu Yong is like my own father. From lighting a heart lamp to affirming myself, creating myself, etc., he gave me a deep inspiration on the road of growth and made me understand a lot of truth. (∩_∩)O~, this book, only after I work, I found out that people in society are not good and bad, especially a female colleague. It makes me feel that I should use the same mentality to face all people. Be wise, you can not harm others, but you can't help guarding others. Read this book carefully, think about it, and you will know more about it in the future, like~~~~~~ 
0	There is no wireless network card driver under the vista system, it can be solved with the driver wizard. The machine is a bit heavy. Heat dissipation needs to be improved. 
1	"The five lecturers of ""Hundred Scholars Forum"" introduced five medical experts in history. Among them, the lecturer of Zhang Zhongjing's article, Professor Hao Wanshan, was a professor at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. After reading the characters, using Yin and Yang, the Five Elements, combined with the case, popularized a lot of useful basic knowledge of Chinese medicine to readers, which benefited a lot after reading! The length of his lecture is the most, reaching more than 100 pages. Thank you Professor Hao! Since the other four speakers are not majors in medicine, they just explained the characters themselves. It is enough to understand the characters. Thank you teachers! ! ! "
1	Thinkpad cooling is of course needless to say, that is a good word. The performance is also good, the Vista system still feels unusable, I plan to switch to XP. 
0	The book is used as a gift for my baby son, but after I ordered it for six days, I saw it, and my mood became worse. 
1	The top double room, we got off the plane and took a bus, and we got there. The outside of the hotel is not very young, the inside is good, the air-conditioning is sufficient, the inside of the room is also good, the overall feeling is good, the opposite is the seafood street, which one eats well Yes, I can’t walk for 200 yuan for 2 people. Haha, the hotel has a shuttle bus directly to Hong Kong, not bad. 
1	In general, the impression is good, the rooms are clean, tidy and stylish, and the internet is fast. For some customers with higher requirements, it should be noted that the shower head for bathing is fixed, unlike ordinary shower heads that can be washed by hand. 
0	It’s really troublesome to install XP and install the driver. If only one-click installation is needed, especially for wireless network cards, the HP website is wrong. 
1	Fast delivery, high cost performance, good appearance, stable performance, low noise, good support for mobile hard drives, drivers and instructions for use are placed in the E drive. The battery has an extended warranty card. 
0	Yu Dan’s experience, I have watched it on TV and on the Internet. I remember that the teacher showed it to us when I was in college. Now I read a book, so I bought one, and I read it and it feels good, as well as bookmarks. The printing is in color and very good. I don’t know what’s wrong with the score in the last comment, it’s very bad? I don’t know if it can be changed, it should be very good, I like it 
1	The use effect is very good, the noise is not big, the hand rest is not hot, the screen is a 2008 Samsung screen, the memory is Samsung's, Hitachi hard disk. The screen is perfect, the mold is good, the keyboard is more comfortable, the touch-sensitive shortcut keys are easy to use, the A side is dark silver, it looks very business, and the workmanship is better. More attractive! The battery is about 2H+. 
0	It is a bit troublesome to install XP. There is no customer service center in Wuhan, saying that it only serves gold customers. Even if I go to them, I still spend money to install it. I spend 70 yuan to install it outside. 
0	The 60G hard drive feels a bit small. After deducting the programs pre-installed in the system, only 120G can be used. If the hard drive 320 is fine 
1	The style and color are quite satisfactory. Compared with the black S10E I bought before, this one looks better than the black one. The battery is classic long. . . Haha. The keyboard is comfortable, and the FN key is in the CTRL, which is in line with my habit. 
0	I like Bi Shumin's book, except for female psychologists. I know that the author has a deep understanding of psychology, so I want to buy the book. Who knows that it is disappointing to read the upper part. The cases and characters in the book are too bizarre and a bit deviating Ordinary public life, maybe the author wants to describe psychologists and psychological counseling more deeply and professionally, so that more people can understand this new subject, but reading the book makes people feel that psychological counseling is far from me. It's too far away, I feel that those of us who have experienced mediocre thinking and mediocre thinking are not in line with psychological counseling, ha ha, just said a few words, it is completely personal feeling! 
0	1. Installed Vista? Sometimes the blue screen shows bad pool caller and I don’t know why? Is there a solution to the problem? 2. The grinding is a bit rough. 
0	I booked a big bed room. The room depends on the main road and the soundproofing is very poor. It is very noisy. I did not fall asleep all night. If you have a bad sleep, you should consider it! 
0	"This book is not as good as imagined. The central meaning of the book can be summarized in two sentences. ""As long as the child wants, parents should accompany their children to read with their children every day, and the sooner the parent and child read, the better"" ""Parents should set an example for children in reading !"". "
1	Good book, Montessori’s philosophy is not understandable at once. It requires theory and practical experience. It is generally difficult to achieve consistent concepts in the family. So the change of concepts is a process. But I really agree with her Philosophy. She is the only early childhood educator who has caused uproar around the world. Many educators also have this concept, but they have not studied it in depth. Montessori has explained those principles through a lot of practical experience. However, China’s Montessori education is affected by the social environment and other atmospheres. It is really difficult to implement. 
0	The sound insulation effect is very, very, very poor. Sleeping in the room is like sleeping on the side of the road, and the sound on the road is clearly heard. I still read the reviews of the hotel on Ctrip and booked a room above the 5th floor based on the opinions of netizens. The result was still very noisy, and I couldn't sleep at 12 o'clock in the evening, so I had to turn on the TV to cover up the sound of cars on the road. I don't know when I fell asleep. I was awakened by the sound of a car early in the morning. I looked at the watch and it was only 4 in the morning! It was only 4 o'clock, which means that even if I fell asleep at 12 o'clock in the evening, I only slept for 4 hours. I have a headache. I have to work during the day. I close my eyes and sleep hard. I can’t fall asleep anyway. It’s too noisy. I can't stand it until 5:30. I called the front desk and asked if there is a quieter room to change. Now I can't change it at night. I answered: No. Stare at the ceiling until 6:30 and get up. After filling 3 cups of coffee in the breakfast room, check out immediately. I was going to live for three days, but I couldn't stand the noise. I really don't understand how such a poor condition has a 4.0 rating on Ctrip. Another: 1. The TV broadcast is too complicated and inconvenient 2. The waiter has a weak sense of service and has no sense of being considerate of customers and problem-solving. This is reflected in breakfast coupons, invoices, etc. 3. The network cable is too short, about 20 cm long, so you can’t access the Internet on the bed. 4. The power connection is not good. When the computer power is connected to the socket, sparks crackling. At that time, I thought: The computer is damaged because of power problems. I don’t know if the hotel will pay for it or not. I have a question again: How can there be a high score of 4 or 0 in such a hotel? Feedback from the hotel on March 30, 2008: First of all, thank you for your stay and give your valuable comments. We apologize for the environmental problems in the room that affect your rest. For some of your questions, we will rectify as appropriate. In addition, the hotel breakfast is used with the room card, and there is no breakfast voucher; our guest room center always prepares a longer network cable for some guests with special requirements, if necessary, only one The phone will be delivered to the room immediately. Thank you very much for your valuable comments and sincerely look forward to your visit again and give us an opportunity to provide you with better service. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the sound quality is good, watching movies is cool, the keyboard is good, and the vista system is being explored 
0	The bathroom standard of the room is too bad, the drain of the basin is broken, and I have to use my hands to pull out the drain. . . The switch of the light in the wardrobe is broken, and the light is still on when the door is closed. There are two cockroach-killing boxes stuck in the bathroom, which makes people uncomfortable. 
1	The overall machine feels good, even the bag is quite satisfactory, very light. 1G graphics card is definitely cool, although there is no game installed yet 
0	The Zhimei CD-ROM cannot be used for XP system. The back of the battery is a bit loose (this is the case for X200) and it is troublesome to install XP. 
0	The first time I bought a book in Dangdang, I encountered a lack of N pages. I was extremely depressed~~~~ I wanted to exchange it, but the procedure was really troublesome. I had to return it first and consider re-ordering later. 
1	"I don't know why, but there has always been a vampire complex in my heart. That race that lives in the dark night gives people mysterious and evil power... I know the Twilight series, originally because of the movie that came out last year. Infatuated with the love legend of vampires and simple girls. Until the readers started to recommend this book, they finally decided to read it. The love in the story always makes people feel warm. I like the feeling that Edward brings to me, the boy who was desperate to protect Bella at all times. I don't know if ""Harry Potter"" is too high in my heart, I personally feel that it still can't compete with HP. "
1	Comes with a bunch of chicken ribs software. The configuration is fairly balanced, although it is a sis chipset---I suspect this is the heat source. . 
1	Small and powerful battery. 720P movies can be watched normally. If you don’t play large-scale 3D games. It is enough for daily use. Delivery is fast. 
0	The machine crashed during the first boot, and it still crashed the second time. I don't know why. The boot was successful for the third time. The notebook has not been disassembled. 
1	Generally speaking, there are not many cars at the door, but there are a lot of cars on Kinmen Road. You can go directly to the train station in the 5th class. It is very close to Hanshan Temple, Lingering Garden, Huqiu Dingyuan! 
1	Thinkpad cooling is of course needless to say, that is a good word. The performance is also good, the Vista system still feels unusable, I plan to switch to XP. 
0	The soundproofing of the cabin is quite poor, and the rooms are very close, and the doorway is the aisle. Because tourists have different work and rest times, they are seriously disturbed by the sound of bathing, flushing the toilet, and watching the sunrise in the morning. The door of the room is the public aisle. A Korean man next door ran out to call in the middle of the night. He didn't know what to say. I went out and asked him to leave in English. Fortunately, he walked away wisely. The room is ok, but the bed is small, only 1 meter wide. There is hot water, hot water is very hot, not bad. 
1	The new mold is much stronger, the screen has no bright spots, it is very good, the heat dissipation is also good, the price is very cheap, the discrete graphics card is good 
0	The advertised four-star hotel is too bad, the rooms are small, the facilities are outdated, and the price of 278 is far from it. . very bad! ! ! I moved the place the next day. . . 
1	I bought it for others, the configuration is good, I can play some games, it is much cheaper than the market here, and the gifts are also good 
0	I really don’t understand why the graphics card is DDR2 memory. Also, the sides of the screen are a bit too wide. Besides, it is too heavy. . . . If the tassel version has the same configuration, it is still recommended to consider the tassel version. It should be much lighter than this one. 
1	Like a novel keyboard. The whole machine runs smoothly and the noise is very small. There is no obvious feeling of heat after several hours of use. 
1	It’s so beautiful, I’m drooling enough to see the pictures, and seeing the real phone makes me even more drunk! Haha, it's a bit exaggerated. But it's really good, not only the appearance but also the connotation! Very good, support domestic products! Jingdong delivery is also fast, and the delivery staff is also very satisfied and satisfied! 
0	When I opened the book, I was attracted and read it in one go. The more I read the book, the more complicated it became. It is difficult to imagine the complexity of the company when I first entered the society. Of course, as a female reader, Lala's love affair has always affected my mood, and in the end it was a good ending. I am ready to buy the second book. The book review is not as good as the first one, but I still want to read it. Maybe we have too high expectations for Lala. 
1	Convenient, speed is ok, normal office work is fine. Long battery life, this one is good 
0	It’s a bit more troublesome to reinstall the system. The default is the LINUX system. I am not used to it. After several hours, I bought the XP of Zhangradish’s home and finally installed it. If you have any questions, you can call Acer’s customer service number 4007001000. They will guide the operation how to reinstall the system. 
1	The performance match is good, the speed is good, and it is very convenient to use. Second, the XP system cannot be replaced. After the replacement, it always fails to start, and the official drivers are not complete. There are many hardware that cannot be recognized. There is no way to replace it. . The memory occupies 50% as soon as it is turned on, and the cpu can always be used to about 60%. 
1	Stronger than the N270 CPU speed, more outstanding continuous use time, good keyboard size and feel. 
0	Hotels in Haikou are particularly cheap, and this one is no exception. However, the actual situation should be directly proportional to the price. The hotel facilities are relatively old, and the swimming pool is outdoor and very small. Won't live again next time 
0	Without the original mouse, I had to buy another mouse myself. Also, the power light is in the front, which is relatively hidden and looks inconvenient. 
0	I don't know why it doesn't bring its own 2G memory, the standard VISTA system can't run at all, and at least it must run with this system. This is unreasonable. 
0	After reading this book, I don't think it is as good as I imagined, but it's just a good publicity! You still have to read the book yourself to know the content, not just relying on rankings or other people's comments. 
1	"In the past, I haven't read any books on medicine. A few days ago, I heard from friends that ""Seeking a doctor is worse than asking yourself"" is very practical. So I bought a copy. I didn't expect it, I couldn't put it down when I saw it. There is no profound medical knowledge in the book. The author uses easy-to-understand language and short stories to explain the diseases we often encounter in our bodies incisively and vividly. The important thing is that I don't know much about Chinese medicine. After the master's advice, I fully realize the magical effect of Chinese medicine in our country. I suggest everyone read it and take a look. Trust me, that's right. "
0	Because I was interested in psychology some time ago, I bought the first and second episodes. I haven't read a novel for a long time. I put it on the bedside and read it little by little every day. No disappointment, because I never placed great hopes on a book. All I can say is that it is out of the ordinary, and it is a bit nauseous after reading it. Freud attributed human psychological problems to sex, and this book follows this principle well. But the bridge in the book drags the whole book from a high starting point to a nasty place. The female psychologist is just an empty halo. This is the first time I read Bi Shumin's book, and also the last time. 
0	This hotel is right next to Wangfujing Pedestrian Street. The location is quite good. The price is also considered favorable. But I originally booked for 5 days, but I checked out the next day. Because the hotel’s air conditioning was turned off. The reason was the heating system in Beijing It has been disabled. Later I checked with other restaurants and found out that it was nonsense...it made me spend a cold night in Beijing. 
0	I want to make a strong complaint. The line lady from Ctrip said on the phone that the guests of this hotel responded very well and we checked in. Who knows, the conditions here are so bad, I suggest you not to stay in this hotel. 
0	I saw the pictures on the introduction and thought I had my fingerprints, but after I got it, I realized that I didn't bring them. I felt cheated. Also, the pre-installed VISTA is really uncomfortable. 
0	"Bi Shumin, a well-known writer and psychologist, has read one or two essays before and thinks that this author is very delicate and his psychological description is very suitable for the sensitive me. After weighing it up, I felt that I was not addicted to buying the novel ""Female Psychologist""! The brief introduction has exhausted the main line of the story. It is a good subject matter, but the cumbersome content is not expected to destroy the book. It should be said that not every book will have a profound impact on everyone, and there are few books that have a profound impact on our lives, and the process of searching for this basic book will undoubtedly test your money for a person who loves to collect books. The helplessness of the bag. Well-known authors have one or two or more famous works, but apart from the books that make Zhi famous, the rest are not necessarily classics, because there is no law that celebrities must publish books. "
1	A relaxed style, but the history written is not easy. I like the language style very much, but reading history is always heavy. I don't yet have the kind of thought, experience, and mind to be able to take a frank view of conspiracy, intrigue, and bloody killing. The first part has been read, but do you want to watch the next few parts? Despite the pain, I think I will. As the saying goes, history is a mirror to know the rise and fall. Reading history requires courage and wisdom as much as reading yourself. This is a kind of exercise. 
1	I bought it for a friend, but it is the same model as I bought myself. Anyway, I think this series has good heat dissipation. Mine is a discrete graphics card. 
0	I don't know how this hotel got such a high score, it's not worthy of its name. The hotel is very old, the facilities are outdated, and the service is average. I booked a double room. First, I gave a room with a window completely blocked by a building beside it. Fortunately, there was a light in the room that didn’t turn on. The reason was to change the room. The second room was on the upper level of the original room. It was also dark and the lights were off. Then I changed to the third room. This time it was finally brighter outside the window, but I couldn't get on the Internet. Had to change, and finally the fourth room was said to be upgraded to a superior room, but in fact there were two more sofas. 
0	I don’t know if I’m stupid. I can’t contact the customer service to check and I can’t find out where my book is. I’m speechless... It’s not the largest in the world. It seems that it hasn’t reached international standards. 
0	We did a field comparison with local hotels. The hardware here is fairly good, and the decoration is relatively new, but it can’t be too high. I live in a suite, but there is no TV in the bedroom and the broadband is not available. It is said that it is under maintenance! Deaf ears-furnishings. 
1	It's a good book! Forgot to rate it! 5 stars! I like the unique perspective inside! The content of the occasion inside is useful to me, some of the content in the color aspect is not understood, too many terms, the love part is my favorite! From the inside to the outside Tips, very useful! I am going to buy a book for my good friend, and send my friend to the market a good choice! I feel that the painting inside is worth collecting! 
1	The battery is good, and the battery life is relatively long; with the XP operating system, the function is enough for the netbook. 
1	The hotel service staff has good service, convenient transportation, moderate prices, and average rooms. 
1	"After I bought the first album, seeing my son like it so much, I bought all the last three albums, ""My First Book"", ""A Word Book That Can Tell A Story"" and ""A Picture Dictionary That Can Jump"" Some words and scenes are repeated in the book, but it does not affect its own value. My English foundation is not very good. After living overseas for a period of time, I learned vocabulary from the ""Story-Telling Word Book"". In general, I want to say that if a boy likes cars, he should buy this series of books. That's right. My son is now two and a half years old, and he has ripped apart ""Lun Lun Zhuan"". "
0	I chose this hotel after seeing good reviews from other users of Ctrip. Very disappointed. The lady at the front desk was surprisingly slow and blunt. What's more depressing is that the room we stayed in for 368 nights was small. The bathroom and toilet were all glass and transparent. Even if the roller blinds were pulled down, there was one side that could not be blocked, so I felt very embarrassed to go to the bathroom. 
0	I placed an order on November 7th and November 9th. The order placed on November 9th was received on November 20th, but the order placed on November 7th has not been received until today. I don’t know what it is. Going on 
1	Nanshi's book is very refreshing to read. Although sometimes I don't understand the meaning, it still attracts me to continue reading. Moving clouds and flowing water, rising on the ground. If you have a deeper understanding of Buddhism, I believe you will like this book even more. But as an ignorant person, I think I will have a lot of understanding and feelings about Buddhism and the Diamond Sutra after reading this book. Actually, ordinary people who do not have the root of wisdom may not be able to approach the Diamond Sutra principles and life , Scholarship, religion, knowledge and action should be interlinked and closely linked. Good, good! 
1	I saw this book a long time ago, and I always thought it was a media hype, so I ignored it. One day I downloaded the DOC version on the Internet to read it, who knows that I can’t stop reading it-there is no gorgeous rhetoric, no flattery to please, and some are just self-reflection and self-motivation! In the face of the impetuous and impetuous academic world, self-reflection and reflection are what we urgently need. Meditation is not a panacea, but it is our mentor and helpful friend! It may be because it is an English translation, which is unclear in some places, but the Meditation Record is really worth a little time to taste slowly! 
0	After I bought it, the baby didn't like it, and I didn't like it either. I say that this book is like Southern Orange and Northern Trifoliate, because the children’s books teach common things in daily life, but this set of books, such as many cars, are available in foreign countries, not in China at all, and it’s not called it that way. Tell him this. Unfamiliar, what's the use of translated things? I can't see it in China; I can't understand it abroad. It's better to keep the original English and it's more practical without translation! 
1	The exterior workmanship is pretty good (except the keyboard), and it looks pretty solid. Jingdong’s processing efficiency is high: I place an order at 23:00 in the evening, and it will be out of the library at 6 am the next day, packaged at 7 o’clock, and can be picked up at 2 pm 
0	There is a lot of time and nothing to do; if you have a lot of money and nothing to buy, then buy a copy. At least you can have a psychological comfort. I feel that with it, you can control your 20-year-old and plan your own For a lifetime. In fact, after reading it, you will only feel that it is like a mother whispering in your ear, it is of no use, and it is thrown away, but it is clean. 
0	It is hard to believe that this is a 3-star hotel recommended by Ctrip! I stayed in a single room for 5 days, and the price was 240 yuan/night. During the period, I learned about the Sinopec test question bank meeting, and the price was 160 yuan/day. The carpet in the room hasn't been cleaned and dusted for N dry years. It looks dark, all kinds of spots, stains, and small holes are very uncomfortable. (The carpet in the aisle is slightly better) The first night was arranged on the second floor, and then adjusted to the 5th floor. The sound insulation was not good. The guests next door returned to the room at 2pm, the door was closed and the TV sounded loudly. The bathroom has glass windows, but they cannot be opened. Plastic curtains are smaller than the window area, so ladies should be careful to expose them. The sewer in the room where I live is not smooth. Every time the stagnant water has to pass the instep, it is very sick! The restaurant is outsourced. A (example) beef tenderloin with pepper is 30 yuan, and a shredded pork with fish flavor is 20 yuan. The price here may only be closer to the 3-star standard. The 5-day breakfast buffet is almost always a soup noodle plus 1-2 omelettes, because there are hardly any flavors to choose from. Because of the meeting, I basically left early and returned late. When I left the store on the last day, I discovered that the sheets I had been padding had several footprints on it! Some of the front desk attendants are kind, some are cold, and cannot be generalized. 
0	The hotel is really bad and the price is very expensive! The mountain view room actually faces a small bald mountain, it is speechless! ! 
1	Small and cute, the brightness of the LED screen is not bad, and it starts quickly. The battery is almost five hours 
1	The performance of N280 is slightly improved compared to N270; Wifi network card supports 802.11N, 300M bandwidth can be shared to see if the 720P film in other machines is not stuck; the actual application battery can not reach 9.5 hours, but it is enough for a whole day of daily use; 92% keyboard Comfortable. 
0	Close to the road and elevated, the room is very noisy! Seriously affect rest. Hotel feedback March 13, 2008: Hello, thank you very much for your valuable comments, now my hotel has been fully renovated, has installed double-sided soundproof glass, the noise has been greatly improved, looking forward to your next stay at Galaxy big hotel! 
0	I have stayed in the worst hotel in Henan during my trip. The hotel is very old and dilapidated. The room is not well lit and the bathroom smells bad. Except for the Xiangguo Temple, it is not very close to other attractions. Maybe the city of Kaifeng itself is full of dust, and the hotel seems to be gray everywhere. The free breakfast buffet has nothing to eat, but it's pretty full 
1	The breakfast was not ideal. I saw little flies sting on the food. I couldn't imagine it. Others are okay. 
0	I only have two words of disappointment for Xinyue Pavilion. I dare to say that those comments are written by themselves. There are too many cheap and good inns in Lijiang. There is no need to book in advance. The price of Xinyue Pavilion can be used in other better inns. It has been several days, and there is no place to put small things in his room. I suggest that everyone go to the inn on the road of Wangu Building. It has a large view, good and cheap, everyone keep the money to play! 
1	The male protagonist of few articles appears in such a foolish image, but the male protagonist of this book surprises us. Although foolish, he loves simple and persistent. The female protagonist is smart and bold. No one can intervene in the love of the two. Although there are some magic elements, it is a creative way of creation. It makes people feel very happy when reading the text. There are little twists and turns, but they can all be resolved one by one. Although it is idiotic, but it makes people love and affection, such a person can enjoy the enjoyment when reading books, it can be regarded as a little compensation for life. After all, there cannot be such a wonderful person in life, hehe. 
0	1. There is no mouse and bag 2. It's a bit heavy 3. The operating system is a flaw and it is really troublesome to install. . . I spent almost 20 hours intermittently to figure it out. Finally, there were three unknown hardware, which were directly disabled. 4. The xp driver of the random disk was incomplete and the official website did not provide download. 
1	The hotel has a good service attitude. There are large conferences held here when you check in. There are no harassment calls in the room. It is close to the river and you can eat local famous Sanjiang fish, Tuo Tuo fish, Xiba tofu and other specialties within a 10-minute walk. Stay here next time. The taxi is very convenient, and no one near the driver knows this hotel. 
1	"I first looked at ""After the blind date"", I thought it was a work with a very consistent style, but I didn't expect that there was still a big difference in temperament. It is estimated that because they are all novels from a female perspective, they are grouped into one series. I like blind dates very much, because the story is more interesting, the language is more humorous, and the state shown in it makes me curious and yearning. And ""Late Blooming in Love"" has the feeling of being a lady, very reserved, solemn, and elegant. However, the common feature of the two novels is that the story is very readable, allowing people to read easily. "
0	I received the book at noon. The speed is very fast. I decided to go down yesterday. It is worthy of praise~ But I was disappointed after receiving it. This book does not have any packaging (maybe the original version is like this), that's fine, but the corners of the book are broken. There is also an opening on the upper edge of the cover. When you read the side of the book, it is not neat when you cut it. I really suspect it is a pirated copy. I will not buy it on Dangdang in the future: (Sad~ I bought so many books in Dangdang, the first time I met To such a thing, disappointed~ 
1	The keyboard can adapt to high-speed typing, which is unexpected and can be used for chatting. It is indeed better than the original 9-inch notebook. The standby time of the battery is not bad, using win7, turn on the wireless, Bluetooth mouse, play 2 hours of high-definition movies, 5.5 hours. The power adapter is very small and fits the positioning of the netbook. 
1	I can learn some myths about ancient Greece from the book, which I find quite interesting. For adults, it is a good book that can kill time and broaden their knowledge. But if you choose to be a children's book, the readability is not strong. The book says it is an illustrated book, but there are only two or three illustrations, and the illustrations are not very useful in the book. (It can be said that it's just for reading, and it can't help understand the article.) So, I think this book is more suitable for middle school students to read! For the elementary school, I think it is more appropriate to choose some books with a better combination of pictures and texts. 
0	Because it is a 16:9 physical resolution, the overall look of the screen is relatively short, it is good to watch HD, but you may not be used to playing games and need to adapt. Also, the anti-virus software sent is not very useful at all, it is better to send a mouse 
0	I bought this book according to the ranking list, and wanted to collect it and tell it to her when my daughter grows up. After I bought it, I found that the printing quality of the book was very poor, especially the smell of lead. I briefly flipped through the storyline, lest it be too general. Why is it so popular? Is the perspective of an adult different from that of a child? I decided to return it! 
0	"The style is a fast hotel, but the service is far from the title of excellent hotel. I live in a business double room, which is the single room closest to the end of the corridor. The room smells very strong, the gray sofa is dirty, and there are several broken In the cave, the network cable in the room is connected by rail, but there are no shops around the ""definitely impossible"", and I will not live in the future.

1	I have never believed in the translation level of Chinese English experts, and I have been disappointed many times. Therefore, I bought the English version this time, and my English level has improved a lot recently. It is no problem to understand. . The manifesto of the community party is the work of Marx and Engels, it is also a testimony of their friendship, and a beacon of China's proven path. Although there are still many problems in our country, it is very good after all, so I have to check it out. What kind of spirit and policy awareness are guiding the socialist countries to move forward, of course they will be bought. . watching. . The version is good. . 
1	"The daughter was only six and a half years old, and she couldn't understand the math story inside. But she had read the children's editions of ""Journey to the West"" and ""The Romance of the Gods"", and she knew something about Nezha and Red Boy, so she kept reading the book when she brought it back, and even asked me to take this book when she washed her feet. Take it to her. One day, I listened to her talking to herself: 1001000...I know this is the largest and smallest chapter in the book. I bet she must not understand the meaning of these numbers, and I also bet she must want to know the meaning of these numbers in her heart. The so-called interest is produced in such a relaxed, happy and no pressure, I hope to accompany her for life. "
0	In fact, the graphics card does not have the official driver disk of the XP system. Even if it is installed with XP, it is just the way it looks. Its functions (the graphics card driver is only compatible) will gradually become incomplete. Therefore, when JD introduces the product, it must first explain clearly, so as not to go astray. Only installing VISTA is the right way. 
0	The service is really bad, it is the worst of all the hotels I have stayed in, the room is also very old, almost no difference from the guest house, I regretted staying 
1	Very beautiful, and Toshiba’s books are also very user-friendly. There is no way to use fingerprints. You have to choose between appearance and fingerprints. This is a minor problem. 
0	The hotel is relatively average and the soundproofing is not very good. What is more unsatisfactory is the breakfast. The taste and variety are not ideal. I hope it can be improved. 
0	In July, our customers stayed for a total of six nights. There were three nights where the room was smelly. The guest was Italian. Due to the language barrier, there was no way to complain. After that, we informed our staff and replaced it. But the next day The hotel was partially decorated. There was no water supply at around 8:00 in the morning. The guests were shaving and washing their faces. It made our company very embarrassed. The shop started to only verbally apologize. The guests expressed their dissatisfaction. Later, our company strongly requested, All rooms (a total of 6) are promised to our member price (actually, each room is a discount of ￥50.00). Who knew that the three room discounts were only given to the final checkout. I was so disappointed with the approach of this hotel. Five stars! The dissatisfaction between the five-star and the pleasant, I wonder if we can draw an equal sign! ! 
1	I haven’t read it yet. I like Teacher Xue and her teaching philosophy. I envy the children in Xue’s class. We can only buy her books and read them. We hope to help the children from the perspective of parents, although it’s certainly not as good as being directly received. Educational, can it be helpful too, originally only read the first grade, others are out of stock, when there is a new version, the child is already in the third grade, and plan to continue to read Mr. Xue’s book as the child grows, and also recommend it to colleagues’ home There are primary school students' reading, I hope it can be helpful to anxious parents. 
0	I thought this was a detailed description of Lust Jie, but I didn't expect most of Zhang's other novels. I was disappointed because I had read most of Zhang's previous works. 
1	Equipped with Core Duo + 2G + 250G + independent display at the price of less than 4K5, it is still a major international brand and it is worth it. Of course, this is the classmate’s opinion, and I bought it for my classmates. But I don’t like HP’s stuff, I LOVE LENOVO. Ha ha 
1	"The Xiamen Hotel I stayed in in July was very good. The front desk staff was very polite. I casually mentioned the free upgrade of other guests, and immediately helped me upgrade from a double room to a double room for free. The room was very large. It’s a bit far away from the bed to watch the TV, ha ha. And the waiter met me the next day and greeted me ""Miss XX, hello."" He remembered very well and helped me apply for late check-out on the last day. Unfortunately, she didn't remember her name (it seems to be Zhou xxiu), otherwise she can call to praise her. The room facilities are also very good, I think they are still new. And the hotel itself has its own garden for walking. Diagonally across the road is Wanshi Botanical Garden (I highly recommend tourists and friends who want to take an afternoon flight on the last day to spend a few hours in the morning. It is very large and well maintained. Botanical Garden). The hotel is also within walking distance from the lively pedestrian street. There are buses at the door to the airport, Gulangyu Island, Xiamen University and other places, which is extremely convenient. I will definitely stay here next time I go to Xiamen. "
1	The keyboard feels good. The system needs to be restored for the first time. The whole process is nearly an hour. During this time, the heat is relatively large, but the temperature control is very good during normal use. The built-in VISTA is still very slow, but the XP on the official website The driver is very comprehensive, and which drivers are installed on a certain model are clearly written 
0	Why is the quality of the book so bad! ! ! The cover is very thin and the cut inside is not neat at all. Is it pirated? ! ! ! ! 
0	The heat dissipation design is general, and the lower left part generates more heat. The screen is average, and I feel nauseous after watching it for a long time. The sensitivity of the touchpad is relatively poor 
0	After reading this book, I feel that there is not much value. There are already many books on this topic, so I haven’t finished reading it. It is only suitable for chatting topics. I really don’t like it very much. 
0	The courtesy of the front desk staff needs to be improved. They are not efficient. Because three waiters deal with one guest's problem at the same time, other guests stand in front of the service desk and ignore them, and the tone of speech is not good, cold, not professional enough. Meet the four-star hotel service. The facilities in the bar room are dilapidated, especially the bathroom, I think it is worse than Samsung, and I did not sleep well all night. The only compliment is Bell Boy, their service attitude is good, smiles are lovely. If you want to stay for 500 yuan a night, it is really not worthwhile. 
0	"Probably the cheapest hotel in Huangshan. When I got into the room at 2 pm, what I saw were the ""American graffiti"" walls, dirty bedding, and dark floors. It was so scary! I directly rushed to the front desk to argue with the lady, and what I got was ""the online room photo is different from the real thing. You have to go to Ctrip. This is the condition on the mountain."" But it seemed that the vacant room on the same floor could at least live in, so I suddenly felt that Ctrip had no advantage! ! Later, I changed my room at my strong request, ha ha! "
0	It’s just that XP is too strenuous. I simply use VISTA. I’m not used to it! Also, I bought it at 4799. It didn’t take long for 4699. I also gave away anti-virus software. I really broke down. It hurts. Hey! 
0	I chose to pay in installments, deducted in Shanghai, and invoices issued in Shanghai, but the things were sent by express from Beijing. It was really hard to get near and far, so I waited for a week to receive the goods. It was really brain-dead! 
0	If you are a person with a lot of negative thoughts. Then look at this might help. If you know that the world is open to you, then this book is even a bit weak. . . . 
0	The service at the front desk of the hotel was extremely poor. I even lost Ctrip’s own room order. In the end, I experienced three more room changes, a painful lesson! Breakfast is better than Helios Hotel! 
0	There are cockroaches! Terrible. The solution to the problem is to send a fruit plate to the end. With a bad attitude, he can only leave with a bag. 
0	The low point of the graphics card is 3400 when it is recognized. The driver may not be installed properly. The WIN7 evaluation is 3.5 points, mainly the graphics card is 3.5 points, and the others are above 5. The CD sent is VSITA, no XP, you have to find it online, first find the network card, and then use Driver Life to download other drivers 
0	Perfect support for vista, but not used to it. Install xp to brush bios! (Very simple, not so mysterious)! The system disk must have ICH9 driver! There is only a popping sound when starting up, it works perfectly after the start, and there is a small speaker icon in the tray area! 
1	5699 returns 600 to send a lot of things, cheaper than similar configuration of Shenzhou. I have used a lot of laptops. This is the first time I bought and used it myself. I am very satisfied with the appearance. It also comes with a genuine vista. 
1	Very cost-effective, the hard disk is powered on for 5 hours, the screen is also a perfect screen, the heat is not big, but the sound of the optical drive is a bit loud 
1	The decoration is good and all new. The service is very good and attentive. In Baoding, the service of the Bank of China left me the deepest impression. Then the breakfast is a buffet, with many varieties and good quality. The transportation around the hotel is also very convenient. The Baoding Municipal Government is opposite the hotel. 
1	At this price point: dual-core processor, 3470 independent display, 250G hard drive. It's already very good. I added two Kingston 2G-800s, no compatibility issues. 
1	The room is small, the sanitation is not very good, the whole environment is very old. The service is average. 
1	1. The facilities are average, not good in Beijing. 2. The service is ok. 3. It is quite convenient to get in and out. 
0	The left and right keys are not easy to use and are relatively rigid; the built-in LIUNX system is too bad, and many things are incompatible, which is very troublesome; you have to change the system; and the built-in input method is very trash, and the characters cannot be played. ; Because it is a small page screen, a page is broken into several screens, I feel I need to adapt 
0	The service attitude is okay, and it’s close to the attractions. I felt pretty good when I checked in, but I was awakened by the creaking sound at night. I thought it was because the quality of the bed was not good. But when I turned on the light, I found a mouse was taking me I went to Xiao Twice, and even stared at us for a minute before running away. I threw away all the snacks in disgust. Tell the hotel that the front desk told the waiter to come over and take a look. Will the mouse be obediently waiting for you? When I checked out, I mentioned the matter again. I asked the manager to say that I didn't go to work. I was sorry and let us go. I really can't live in a small hotel! 
1	"Workplace = battlefield, stumbling horses and dark arrows, it is really hard to prevent, but if you do not do this, it will definitely affect the development of normal work. For our own work, position, salary, and status, we will go forward and move forward! The prophet is the leader in the foresight, the follower is the follower, and the elimination is unknowingly! After watching ""Step by Step"", it is no exaggeration to say that there was a thin layer of cold sweat. The workplace is really a battlefield without gunpowder. You have to fight steadily every step of the way, but there may not be true feelings in the workplace. Compared with the shadows of these silent swords and swords, I am fortunate that I am in a simple and kind group. "
1	I bought this book for my son because he strayed off the topic in his recent composition test and lost big marks. The son himself proposed to strengthen the study in this area. I searched the bibliography related to composition learning, and found that many books are rigid and do not adapt to the characteristics of children nowadays. This book has a good experience in teaching and is widely used and promoted. I want to buy a copy and give it a try. I got the book and it was really good. The thinking is clear, the examples are vivid, and the composition method is concise and easy to accept. Value for money. This set: There are three essay books in total. After digesting this book, look at the other two. 
0	Although it is a work of a fellow villager, it is still a bit far-fetched from an objective point of view. Although the author has a rich experience and a good literary style, he does not like the structure and style. This time I followed the trend and made the mistake: ( 
1	The location is good, the environment is good, the room is large, but the breakfast is not as good as it used to be, and the overall feeling is good. Special emphasis, good service! 
0	The hotel is really good value for money. We stayed at this hotel temporarily because of the late flight. The hardware facilities of the hotel are relatively poor and do not meet our environmental requirements. I will not say the details. The service is also very poor, basically like a Guest house. But the hotel has a pick-up service, you need to request it yourself and the hotel. Ctrip cannot help arrange it. This is disappointing. In addition, I remind friends who are going to Sanya on vacation, not to listen to the taxi's advice when eating seafood in Sanya. 
0	hp's linux system is to modify the Ubuntu system, the interface is single, not as cool as Ubuntu! Currently ready to uninstall 
1	Many methods in the book actually say that it is difficult to remember, but it is really uncomfortable. I have read the first two books, but I am often lazy in Massage Meridian. Reading this book can urge myself to insist on massage. Some people always say that the meridian can’t be proved. What happened to Chinese medicine? I used to be angry. Now I think Chinese medicine is not only a kind of medicine, but also a kind of philosophy, a kind of religion, a kind of art, and it is incomparable with Western medicine. Yes, the person who believes in Chinese medicine is fate, and the person who does not believe is deemed to be unfavorable, and there is no need to be angry. The charm of Chinese medicine is worth enjoying in a lifetime. 
1	The service is very good. Press the button of the service center to put forward your own needs, and someone will respond soon. The downside is: the room is a bit small, the house is a bit old 
1	Very good, the scenery is beautiful, there is the sea under the window, drinking beer in the bar on the side, looking at the sea view, it is so enjoyable, I will go to this hotel next time 
1	"""Task-based teaching"" has attracted much attention in our foreign language teaching community. The new ""English Curriculum Standards"" of the Ministry of Education includes ""advocating a'task-based' teaching approach and cultivating students' comprehensive language ability"" into teaching recommendations. Task-based teaching is regarded as a good way to reform traditional foreign language teaching in my country. Based on the status quo of foreign language teaching in my country, this book comprehensively analyzes the theoretical and practical basis of ""task-based teaching"", and illustrates the specific operating steps of ""task-based teaching"" with examples. It provides teaching and research references for the majority of frontline English teachers. "
0	I saw that everyone said it was very good before, so I was very excited and I bought the book and looked at it very generally. It talks a lot to let us admit that we are a layman. Talk a lot just to say the importance of money. Isn’t the people now vulgar enough? Not enough Worshiping money? I don’t need her to say that I know the importance of money. I guess everyone knows the article about having a princess’s hand, although it sounds reasonable, but if everyone takes care of their hands well If no one does things, then those things that are left to do are not in line with our actual situation. It is impossible for everyone to ask a nanny at home! There are also more than 200 pages in the whole book, but in fact the fields are very large and the pages are left. A lot of Bai has not much content at all, it's not worth buying in a word 
1	It is not easy to find a room at such a cheap price in a four-star hotel in Dalian. At first, I was hesitant. What is the 260 yuan room like? After moving in, I feel that the room is still ok, no different from the normal room. There are windows and Internet access. It is spacious for one person. It is especially suitable for business people and the price/performance ratio is relatively high. The location of the hotel is very good, just in the commercial center, shopping, eating is very convenient, the night view is beautiful, it is a good hotel. 
1	[Recommended book] Although it is defined as a children's book, I think that reading it in each period will be different. The little prince is fictitious, because he is not suitable for this logistics society of feasting and feasting. Nowadays, how many people's thoughts are imprisoned, their actions are restricted, and their words and deeds are restricted. Everyone unanimously chose silence, perhaps this is the general trend. However, the little prince is just such a book that can move the soul. Only when the soul can evolve can life be better. All I recommend the little prince, he is popular reading. 
0	When I got off the plane, Changsha was 35 degrees. As a result, this hotel did not have air conditioning. There was only a so-called vent. The windows were all fixed. I could only stretch my head out to breathe. It was almost too hot. Moreover, everything in the hotel costs money. Almost everything that can be touched by the hand is attached to the price, which is too scary. 
1	The transportation is convenient and the surrounding area is also lively. It is natural that the room is small in Hong Kong, and in general it is good value for money. 
1	The hotel covers a large area and is known as a garden style. The Yingbin Building where I lived was in very general condition and fairly clean. There is no broadband on the first floor. It is said that there is only on the third and fourth floors. Because I booked it in advance, when I arrived, I found that the extra bed had been added in advance, which was not bad. Considering that it is in Anqing and the house price is still cheap, everything is not a concern. 
1	If I were to travel to Dongguan by myself, I would still stay in Dongguan Hotel, but if I came to Dongguan with my boss, I might live in Sofitel. I like the environment of Dongguan Hotel and its several restaurants. It is very quiet and comfortable in the busy city, and the service of the hotel is also very good. For ordinary business travelers, the standard rooms of Dongguan Hotel are the best value for money. 
0	When reading the disc, the sound is loud. On the one I bought, the upper right side of the keyboard (the del key) is obviously prominent. The front printing is not very nice. 
1	Overall, it is relatively clean, and the location is very good, the downtown area is very convenient. 
1	"No educational method can compare to parents' precepts and deeds. After reading this book, I really broke into a cold sweat. It turns out that anger can also be inherited. It's terrible to think about the bad influences that I have left on my children in daily life. After I read it for the second time, I realized that family education does not need to learn so many books. In fact, we only need to be a good parent. In fact, we just don’t ""inherit"" bad behaviors. The child will do. Thank you to the publisher of this book for making complicated family education simple. "
0	There are 2 RAMs. If you upgrade, you must abolish at least one, which is a bit wasteful. It should be a little bit for the sake of users. The USB interface is a bit tight, and the memory storage cover is tight, so it can be flattened by pressing hard. 
0	This is a book that picks up other people's leaks. I regret buying such a worthless book. Please don't be fooled anymore! ! ! ! 
0	Good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good 
1	"This book continues the author's consistent writing style, bloody, heartbroken love story. Although the plot of the story is similar to ""Naked Agents"", it is also out of the normal life of people, but it is very attractive. People read novels because of emptiness, so slightly exaggerated stories are acceptable. But I think the readership of this book should be 18-25 years old. If you are past this age, it is recommended not to buy, because you will find it boring. Different books are suitable for different people. Please choose according to the actual situation. "
1	The service is very careful, the room is old, but the supplies are clean. The waiter is very qualified, and I found the wallet and returned it to me. I am very grateful. 
0	Ctrip employees had better go live and watch by themselves! This is a hotel that doesn't even have three stars. Very dissatisfied: 1: I don’t know on Ctrip. The overall rating of this hotel is 4.3. Misleading guests. 2: The hotel price is not high, and the location is too partial. 3: Breakfast is the worst hotel I have ever eaten, and there are flies in the meat buns. Please do not live, it is really not as good as Motel. Additional comment June 25, 2008: The staff is sincere and willing to live again next time!

1	The hotel facilities are indeed old, but the carpets can be changed. They are so broken and dirty. The service attitude is good. For every customer, there will be a waiter to send you into the room. There is also a pot of tea with heat preservation set in the room, very warm . 
0	The heat dissipation area on the side is indeed a bit hot, especially when running a relatively large program, the power adapter is not very hot as stated on the Internet; it is actually a bit heavy...; 
0	It's much worse than I expected. The words are not all commonly used, and the edited ones are not practical. The point is that they are not funny at all. 
0	The battery time is short, the wireless network card does not go on, the template is 10 inches, not 8.9, not as small as imagined. 
1	The location is really good. I lived in a single room with a double bed. When I entered the room, it looked like a suite. However, one cabin had a table and TV, and the other cabin could only fit a bed and TV. It was really pitiful. I didn’t eat breakfast at the hotel because of work, but Hao Gang’s Haggis on the opposite side is really impressive. The only regret is that it only opens at noon and is closed at night... I wanted to buy a plane ticket in the hotel’s business center, but I was told You can't swipe your card, you can only check out in cash, so I didn't buy it. 
0	The BIOS needs to be changed when the machine is installed, and the heat dissipation is not good. 3dmark06 does not respond, it may be that the AMD CPU needs to be patched 
0	Poor difference, big room and poor furniture, breakfast but poor quality, broadband but poor internet speed, almost equal to zero. The environment is good and the traffic is too bad. 
0	The service is poor and the quality of the book is poor. I suggest you not to buy it. Dangdang's books are very old. The most important thing is that the service is poor. One phone station will deceive people and shirk responsibility. 
1	I got it and saw that the machine was very beautiful, the XP system was installed smoothly, and it was running very fast. I like it very much. 
1	The lines are tough, the outline is clear, and the workmanship is excellent. The hinge can expand the screen 180 degrees. The keyboard feels great, and typing noise is small. Samsung perfect screen. The matte screen is suitable for business applications. It is not easy to be visually fatigued after long-term use. The screen brightness can be automatically adjusted. The battery capacity is as high as 56Wh, and the battery life is strong. It can be used for 3 to 4 hours. The battery cell is Korean and the control chip is Samsung. The memory is Samsung, with 8 particles on both sides, timing 6-6-6-18. The hard drive is Seagate. The optical drive is Samsung, modular. The power adapter is a thin sheet type, manufactured by Delta. The overall heat dissipation of the notebook is excellent. 
0	I bought a set of very thin torn paper boxes. My colleague bought a hard box packaging. Can Dangdang give a reasonable explanation? 
0	The cost performance is average, mainly reflected in the unsatisfactory breakfast, and hope to increase the variety. 
0	It is really unacceptable that the hard disk is divided into 1 zone. Random 1G memory on vista is very difficult, after adding 2G quickly. Partitioning is not possible under Vista, and the partitioning software is not compatible. There is no way to change back to XP, and a useless system is pre-installed. 
0	The room is very poor, with a mixture of heavy smoke and moisture. All of my clothes that I wear in the room have a strong smell, even though I only stayed for two nights. The bed is also hard and small, and the bedding is very low. The TV is even more outdated, like a model ten years ago, and the signal is very poor. The breakfast taste is very low, like a guest house style. The restaurant is dark and it is very frustrating. Other places are not impressive. Anyway. It is hard to understand that such a hotel is listed with 5 stars. 
1	The machine works very well, the design is very inline, and it still has the style of ThinkPad. The thin and light is well done. The packaging is very strict and the display effect is not bad. The package I sent feels well made. 
1	1,Beautiful fashion appearance, yes,No kidding! 2,Rough configuration for a Miss to use; 3,Moderate price; 4,Good performance in XP,but not Vista; 
0	I bought this book after reading so many five-star reviews before I bought it. I thought it should be a book worth owning! After reading such a book, in my mind this so-called five-star book really It's terrible! I finally finished reading it after a few nights. The content in the book is about? How to read aloud to cultivate children's interest in reading!? Written, but the book is too boring, a lot of nonsense... I shouldn't write such a long book, and there is a lot of nonsense. I need to read the entire book completely, but I feel very impatient during the process of reading the book. I really don't understand what the author is doing with so much nonsense... .... If parents already know the importance of raising children's interest in reading, there is no need to spend this money to buy this book! The book says that by letting parents read aloud to accompany children's reading interest! I personally think, As long as parents can lead by example and love to read, they will accompany their children to read together with their children since childhood, so that children must have liked books since they were young! 
0	This set of books has vivid pictures, pays attention to the details of life, and is very attractive to children. The colleagues who are reading understand the common sense of life/experience some interesting processes. Satisfaction! 
0	The room was average, the water in the bathroom bathtub was a bit stuck. The standard room opened the window to the lobby restaurant. At 12 o'clock in the evening there seemed to be people eating and playing music, which was quite noisy. 
0	There is no Bluetooth function, no camera, no fingerprint recognition, and no reserved 3G module, which is difficult to upgrade. 1G memory is too small, the originally expected X4500's integrated graphics performance is disappointing, and it has become a bottleneck in the vista scoring system 
1	The appearance is good, different from the pictures on the Internet, but very satisfied. The screen is very comfortable. It is also easy to change XP. 
0	The room facilities are outdated and the service is average. Because of the hotel I arrived at noon, the network debugging needed help, so I actually said that everyone had a rest at noon and had to wait for work after 1 o'clock. The breakfast is still very rich, will not live next time, the price is not high. 
0	The heat dissipation is a bit poor, which may be a common problem of HP. The bottom right is sometimes too hot. The price is falling too fast (I just bought 500, sweat, electronic products are just like this). 
1	I was forced to buy this book. I can't help it. My teacher ordered it. The stuff is very useful. The boring content is inevitable for any etude book. One minute on stage, ten years of work off stage. The whole book is a variety of fingering exercises. The rules are all that should be practiced. It will greatly help improve the basic skills. The book is classified by fingering. There are several rules for each type, and you can practice slowly. No good Basic skills, you only want to pursue speed, and you will be unable to achieve the truly difficult songs. PS: Each etude in the book is compared with the stave. It is convenient for all levels. 
0	I hope that when I don’t want to buy two books, I will only send one of them when one is out of stock, and I don’t know it myself, so when I buy another one, I will have to add shipping charges. Please be smarter in your system , Don't be so stupid 
1	"""Sleep, sleep, always sleep, there should be more fun things to do in life."" This Carmela’s classic has been incorporated into his mantra by my son. He also didn't want me to always let him this or that. He wants to live his own way. Although he seems ""disobedient"", as a mother, he has learned to be autonomous since he was a child and I feel happier. "
1	I like AMD's chips, which are cost-effective. This kind of heat dissipation is good, like AMD's chip, good price 
0	It takes a lot of effort to partition the HP computer. It took 2 hours to get the original system installed with XP. Novice friends need the help of a computer. 
1	I bought it in 2099. The original color is not pure white. It’s a bit yellowish. Is it because I’m afraid of getting dirty? It took a day to install XP 
1	I won't talk about the advantages, everyone has said a lot, it is really good, the fighter in the notebook! ! ! 
0	To be honest, I have been booking a room with the co-cheng, and I have always found it very convenient, but this time the room here is almost impossible to live in, even if it is attached to the side of the exhibition center, it is not such a fool. If you have a car, you still live in the city and drive. The venue is also convenient. We used to live in Xujiahui and came by car. As a result, when we entered the door: the walls were mottled, the windows leaked, and we went up and banged (steel floor), like a work shed. The room at night was very It's cold, and the air conditioner is useless at 30 degrees! If you don't have a car, choose to stay next to the subway, which is also convenient. Anyway, don't live here in Shanghai Pudong!! 
1	The heat dissipation is well done, the screen is gorgeous and there are no dead pixels, and the Dolby surround effect is also very good. Adding 3G memory is much faster. The function keys are very practical and the interfaces are quite rich. . 
0	Hu Lancheng seems to be passionate, but in reality it is ruthless. Hu Lancheng was merciful everywhere, but did not use affection deeply. The book not only describes the love between Hu and Zhang, but also Hu Congxiao's life experience. This book promotes too much of Hu and Zhang's love, and there are more things in the book. The writing style is delicate and soft, which is suitable for middle school students to improve their writing skills by reading. I personally think that readers who prefer the plot to win the work should not waste time. 
1	The breakfast food is quite average, not in line with its service standard, I hope further improvement. 
1	I was trying to read it on the Internet. I felt that the creativity of the mook book was already very attractive and in line with my reading hobby, coupled with the general super cool author title, so I bought the first episode, it is really good, I like it, and worth collecting! Collect this episode again! 
1	I stayed in a deluxe double room with good hardware, but unfortunately there were fine hairs on the sheets, but the service desk changed it as soon as it was notified. The buffet is good. This is the best hotel in Tongxiang. 
1	The main reason is that the rooms are very good. The co-process has booked a deluxe room of less than 400, and also gave a fruit plate. The only downside is that the room is a bit old. It is said that there is a new Shangri-La in the surrounding area, so there should be a relatively affordable price to attract people. 
1	I was in a pretty good mood before reading this book. When I slowly entered the river of sadness, my mood turned into a cloudy sky. It took one night to finish reading this book. The book is quite similar to reality. Four realities are written into the novel. There is no shortage of people like Tang Xiaomi in real life. The story of the heroine Yi Yao makes people feel that she is really pitiful and I feel bad. Everything went to her, so she chose to commit suicide by jumping off the building. I recommend everyone to read this novel. Warm reminder: You may cry when reading this novel, so prepare some tissues to pull next to you. 
0	It's not as good as the introduction, and I don't feel that it can make people feel awkward. In short, it is not good for memorizing words. 
1	The workmanship is exquisite and the screen is very beautiful. Regarding the speaker problem that everyone has said, I don’t think you should be too demanding on it. Just make such a small instinct to make a sound. You can connect a small speaker for sound effects. 
0	I really don't like it. I'm absolutely not looking at it. I wasted my energy. I usually give up after watching it. It’s better to read the travel brochure when you have time 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the battery is more durable, the hard drive is very quiet (Seagate, better than msiU90 WD) 
1	It depends on where you look at the ending. I felt very sad before, but in the end, I think that this ending may be satisfactory for both of them. She has shouldered too many responsibilities in this world. 
1	I booked it for a foreigner customer, the environment is good, it is recommended, I live in a deluxe room, but the price is too high, I hope Ctrip can negotiate with the hotel for a price, it will be cheaper, the customer said that he will stay next time ! 
1	Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation 
0	"It is said that the 9th floor is under renovation! But living on the 5th floor is still too noisy to sleep. It is suspected that the 6th floor is also being renovated, and the sound is just overhead. The electric drill started noisy at 6 or 7 o'clock. Headache is splitting. The location is hard to find. Not facing the street. Hotel feedback June 2, 2008: Dear guest: Hello! You have not been able to enjoy the quiet environment during your stay. We are deeply disturbed and we apologize to you. In order to create a beautiful hotel environment and make the living environment more comfortable for the guests, our store is undergoing renovation and renovation of guest room hardware. The construction time is from 8:00 to 20:00. I am very sorry that the construction unit did not perform the construction within the specified time. For your rest, for this reason, we have contacted the construction party again, asking them to observe working hours and prevent such incidents from happening again. The roof of the hotel is being decorated and installed with the city’s most distinctive landmark building: ""Golden Gourd"". I believe that when you visit our store again, it will give you a new look and will make you feel our more dedicated service. Thank you again for your loyal evaluation, and sincerely apologize to you, and sincerely ask you to stay again and provide valuable comments! I wish you good health, smooth work and all the best! "
1	The transportation is quite convenient, both advantages and disadvantages. Living on the dozen or so floors is still a bit noisy. Other things are okay, four stars. 
1	1. The metal texture and the brushed surface are too perfect. 2. The keyboard is full and the keys are very comfortable. 3. It's okay to have two USB ports, and VGA can connect to the TV. 
0	I flipped it over and put it down. honestly. . The picture is not cute. . . The content did not look closely. . Doesn't attract me. . . 
1	Delivery is fast. Order at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and it will arrive at 11 o'clock the next morning. The appearance and workmanship look good, and the external power supply is very small. The invoice states that the warranty is two years. 
1	High performance-price ratio; good display screen; a 2G memory; fast speed; delivery speed is ok, 2 days from order to receipt 
1	The delivery speed is fast, the store order information is tracked in time, and the goods are very good. When I first got the goods, I felt that ASUS was really much better than other brands. The double box; the performance is very good. 4599 yuan can buy 3470 unique Obviously, it's still Core 2, which feels great value... 
0	The view of the room is pretty good, and it looks out like an ancient canal, which is full of ancient poetry. But the shower facilities in the room were not good, the shower door was not closed tightly, the water from the faucet was very small, and the bath was very uncomfortable. The TV has two remote controls, which is very inconvenient to use. The main front desk lady's service is very bad, cold, especially the fat-faced lady, whose face is like paste, without a smile. When I went to CHECK IN and CHECK OUT, I felt very uncomfortable. I feel that the training of waiters needs to be strengthened and the sense of service is too poor! ! ! 
0	I am more interested in psychology, and then I saw that it was the top best seller, so after I bought two books and read them, I felt indescribable. This psychologist has some problems with his character, and he can do whatever he can to achieve his goal. . . . Very general, although the plot is quite mysterious, but it doesn’t feel very exciting 
0	The heat dissipation control is not very good, it may be a common problem of the independent display; the sound quality is too bad and needs to be improved. 
0	The optical drive is not very good, and it feels like you want to fall apart. Haha, overall it's ok. The installation of the system is a bit tricky, so I installed it for an hour. 
1	"I looked at it roughly, how can I say it? I feel that from the book, in addition to learning about A Zeng's personality, more is that I can understand all aspects of society at that time. From this perspective, it is a good point of view to look at the Qing Dynasty at that time. Recently I was reading ""Zeng Guofan"", which was also written by Tang Haoming. Hehe, I think people who are interested, it is best to read the family book of Atang Dianping first, and then read ""Zeng Guofan"". You will find that after reading this book , Reading ""Zeng Guofan"" will make it easier to enter the society at that time to understand Zeng~~ "
0	Maybe this is not a good reason, but the reason why I like to read books instead of reading information on the Internet is because I like to smell the scent of books. This book may be because of the bad printing ink or some reason, it feels stinky. Good smell. There are some little anecdotes about Chinglish, some little fun, but it feels that it is more useful for people who have a strong Chinese thinking habit to speak English.

0	The Ming Dynasty history was written in a ridiculous and popular way, which not only popularized the history, but also allowed readers to enjoy the pleasure of reading. Thank you Mingyue that year, so talented! 
1	"My little cute said that the two little mice are so cute. She likes to read it very much. Just because she read this series of books by Zheng Yuanjie, she wrote an essay describing the story of a puppy who arrived on an alien planet. It's interesting, even the teacher typed ""good"". Hehe~ So she can say that my mother buys it for me. I was very inspired when I saw it. Haha, she is still so young and inspired, I secretly smiled, haha~Of course I will continue to buy her. Not bad! "
1	It should be regarded as a mid-range machine. The appearance is good. The paint panel should not be worn out. It is still quite textured. The speed under VISTA is OK, faster than expected. 
0	I feel that this story is not as attractive to me as in the introduction, but it is definitely not a relationship far away from my life in that era. The protagonists in the incident are too mythical. The whole story is like love words between people who are in love. It is definitely an expression of a very self-state. I don’t like it very much and I am not very moved. The story is too beautiful and there is no defect. I can't feel real anymore~ 
0	Before I bought it, I saw a lot of people saying that installing the system was troublesome, but it was not only a little annoying, the hard drive was not found at first. . . After searching for a long time, the biggest problem is installing the driver. The driver of this sound card is really annoying and there are many unknown devices. 
1	The service is warm, the transportation is convenient, the breakfast variety is less, but it is relatively clean, I will go to live next time I go to Chongqing~~~ 
1	All aspects of the configuration are very generous. Very cost-effective. It is not heavy in a computer of the same specification. The keyboard feels nice. 
0	Very disappointed, I changed the hotel on the second day of the week. It is a wellness center. The room facilities are at most 2 star standards, but it costs 498. It is strange that Ctrip still has such a hotel. When I arrived at the hotel at 9pm, it was dark and I thought it was a taxi that took me to the wrong place. 
0	Generally speaking, like the textbook, the characters only have the character of the author but not their own. The documentary summarizes the novel, ha ha 
0	The hotel is average and the facilities are okay, except that there may be some bugs on the bed. I feel itchy in the morning. The colleagues who live with me also feel the same way. I dare not live anymore. 
0	The widescreen is also too wide, 10mm wider than the SL300, but 15mm flat, and the screens on both sides are basically not usable. Only two USB ports are still on the left side, not only are they missing, but it is really inconvenient to connect to the mouse. The keys are too big and the workmanship is average. I use it generally. 
1	The machine is generally very fast, and the speed of the SSD is extremely fast. I originally wanted to add 1G of memory, but now it seems completely unnecessary. Install XP, use office 2007, open files and so on, faster than my T61. 
0	I also decided to buy this book after reading all the reviews. Some of the reviews were very positive. Not many people said how good this book is. I think this book is not popular enough. The content method in the book It is only suitable for short-term use by a small number of people, not long-term use. So friends who read the book, you must consider your personal physique before using the methods in the book. I always think this book has a very high commercial nature. 
1	The workmanship is exquisite and the performance is stable. I mainly play Warcraft and watch videos without encountering obstacles, which is very good. The standby time is not covered, I am very satisfied, about 6-7 hours, and it is normal use; 
1	The price is less than 5K, the powerful graphics card performance, the memory hard disk are justified, the CPU is not 800 FSB but it is enough for daily movies and games. 
1	"The Twilight City series of books can be called classics. I agree with most people's views. The four books in this series constitute a complete story. The handsome and kind vampire, Bella who has a deep understanding of others in the overall situation, has a profound love and affection that affects everyone, which is meaningful. This work is the most complete book I have ever seen, and it left a deep impression on me. Looking forward to seeing the film ""Joking New World"" based on this book. Hereby recommend this set of books to friends who like to read. "
1	I often live in Tibet Building. It is mainly convenient for business trips. The surrounding restaurants are also familiar. There is also a Wumart hypermarket. It is relatively convenient to go to the first airport. 
0	I booked this hotel because I went to work on Changshou Road, but it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in Shanghai! The hotel is a single building without any beautifying environment such as greenery. Calling a car at the door is super difficult, because the drivers in Shanghai don't stop at this hotel for some reason. They can only be called when a passenger gets off the car at this location. It is really freezing to death at the door! The lobby is on the sixth floor. There is no parking lot downstairs. The basement parking lot is very small. The superior double room is very small and not square. It is a triangular structure. The bed faces the door. It feels very insecure when lying on the bed. When you open the door, you can see people. Could it be that Ctrip can only arrange this room? ! The facilities and equipment of the room are barely three-star. Nearly 600 yuan a night is really not worth it. I will never step into this hotel next time, and I will tell my friends that Shanghai must not stay in this hotel, the price is too low! ! ! 
1	I am a rookie. It’s the first time I bought this notebook. I feel that this notebook is more cost-effective. The newly installed system is running well. VISTA works well. There is also a fast wireless Internet connection! ! ! 
1	"The book itself is a collection of short stories, just named after one of them, ""The Little Fisherman"". So what I remember most was this short story. . . The image of Xiao Yu is like a fleshy girl next door in life. It is not about the depth of thought and the height of life, but only clear eyes and heart. It seems to live with no purpose and a little bit of helplessness. , But never gave up anything, did not deliberately insist on anything, like a soft wicker, spring comes green and autumn comes yellow. Few can write such an impressive example in a life without personality. . . "
1	A good choice for a business trip to Liuzhou, especially the business room, the night view of the north-facing room is good. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your long-term support and concern for our hotel. Our south-facing river view rooms are also very good. In addition, the high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, will soon be completed, looking forward to your visit! ! 
1	The price is not too good. Others are pretty good 
1	Convenient transportation and good service, very nice hotel. The only dissatisfaction is that the price is not competitive, more expensive than ordinary members of Hanting. And there is no breakfast, which is a pity. 
1	The 15.4-inch mirror screen looks cooler, with a built-in camera card reader, wireless network and camera can be turned off with one key, which is more user-friendly. The driver installation is also quite simple. Insert the CD-ROM and install them one by one. 
0	"After reading this book recommended by so many successful women, I wanted to read it when I was in my twenties, and I looked forward to seeing ""a lot of benefit"". It's a pity that when I saw halfway (Kenneng was not halfway there), I jumped and flipped through it. I really didn't have the intention to read each word carefully. Because those so-called examples and what they want to explain are not all the most basic truths and qualities that a normal person should possess? Does a woman in her twenties want someone to teach this? If anyone's answer is ""yes"", then I think that's nothing more than her life. "
1	"The reason why I read this book is because there is a chain reaction after reading the ""An Yiru"" series. I didn’t think I started to pay attention to this kind of books. Fall in love with Chinese classical poetry and want to know more, know more. In this book, every time it reads like a beautiful story, sometimes it is unavoidable to indulge in it for a long time. In fact, it is a story, rather than a ""poetry history"". Too much history, always feel too bloody, suddenly using such a light language to tell, it has a different charm. "
1	I want to say that this is a real classic. Bizarre plot, perfect text, fruitless ending, youthful memories. Compared with Letting Fengling, its plot is more saturated and the hurt is more reserved. Compared with the forest in Norway, it is longer and more memorable. :) I'm not middle-aged, I'm afraid I won't read deeply, but I should be able to read it all at once; if I haven't read a lot of Murakami's books, I'm afraid it won't compare. Good book, I suggest you buy two books, one for yourself, one for your next generation, or for a loved one, for example, tell her that she is your pinball. 
1	The hotel is suitable for vacations. There is a free shuttle bus to and from Hankow Road in Tsim Sha Tsui every hour. The room size is moderate and you can lie on the bed to watch the sea. My son doesn't want to come up in the swimming pool and lacks bathrobe. Breakfast is ok. 
0	Why doesn't the business notebook have a camera? If you have to have a single camera for online meetings, I don’t know what the R&D staff think about. The 4-cell battery can only be used for more than two hours, which is not enough~ I don't know if it is because of the VISTA system, the startup and shutdown are super slow. 
1	The front desk room service attitude is very good! The breakfast is very rich and the price is very clean. make persistent efforts! Chinese hotels have few smoke-free rooms, or putting ashtrays in drawers is smoke-free treatment. Do 75% non-smokers like us need to endure 25% more smokers? I hope that hotels run by China will learn from foreign companies. Please provide more non-smoking floors. Thank you. There is no smoke-free floor in my original room rate, so I have to pay an additional 20% to upgrade the non-smoking floor room with a higher level. We are the 75% non-smokers, it is about time that the Hotel respect us to have the freedom of freshair, BAN the Smokers in the Check-in or Check-out counter please. Thank you. No or very few smoke-free rooms! Smoking is not allowed in the elevator, and there are still some smokers who still do not obey the rules! I am a non-smoker and a victim of second-hand smoke! (Out of China’s 1.3 billion population, there are only 320 million smokers. Less than 1/4!!! ) Smokers who read this comment, please feel okay? Thank you. 
0	It's just relying on the name to attract people's attention. The content is empty and has no practical meaning. It is all nonsense that everyone understands. 
1	Fortunately, I scored five stars at the time. This set of books is now the favorite of my one-year-old and ten-month-old son. Whenever it comes to storytelling every day, he starts to ask me to talk about the car. Hello, I want Lababa... .... It is worthy of being an excellent national children's book for 2005-2008. 
0	I won’t talk about the deficiencies of the software. In short, it’s cheap. The operating system and driver problems are troublesome to solve by themselves, but it is acceptable. The heat dissipation of this model is really poor, and the panel is easy to scratch. 
1	Chandler's books are truly masterpieces, and any high evaluation cannot be exaggerated. The so-called real art exists, such as this book. The text goes up like clouds and flowing water, heartily. The plot is superb, not far-fetched. The artistic conception is relaxed and has a long aftertaste. Such a book is refreshing and refreshing to read, and I am reluctant to let it go. The metaphor is superbly crafted and full of wisdom. This is the artwork. Chinese writers/works belong to the countryside, and Chandler's novels belong to the cities --- this is what Wang Shuo said. 
1	When I went to pick up the goods for a few days, I found that it was not ugly at all. Although the screen is LCD, its design is also very stable. This configuration and the price are really worth it! 
1	In the development zone, the location is good and easy to find. Compared with the five-star hotel in the urban area, the hardware is slightly worse, but it is still clean and comfortable. Considering the price is cheaper than the urban area, the price/performance ratio is not bad. There are shopping malls and dining streets nearby, which are very convenient for shopping and eating. 
0	The mouse is too difficult to use, and ASUS is not kind. The laptop bag is rough. Because I should add a Bluetooth 
1	Came to live again last Tuesday. This time I stayed in a double room. I have the biggest problem. I was given a room with a very strong decoration. After I went in, my nose felt very uncomfortable. The window opened for about half an hour before it got better. I didn’t tell the customer about the recent renovation. Can I not give a room with a taste of renovation in the future? 
0	After reading this book, the only gain is that the author tells you to cherish your body, but I already know this 
1	The Home Inn mentioned earlier should be Home Inn Shenzhen Railway Station, located in the Yumen Village community. 
0	"I have stayed in the worst of all three-star hotels. 1. The surrounding environment is extremely poor. 2. The Karaoke on the second floor feels very ambiguous. There are very ""professional"" women in the elevator. 3. The hotel has a mold Taste. 4, wine "
1	Fashionable appearance, extraordinary style, high-definition playback and 3D processing capabilities, fast speed, easy and easy to switch on and off 
0	Why not pre-installed xp? There is only one initial partition of the hard disk. The engineer of this product does not use a computer himself? 
0	People live for all the good things, food, beauty, beautiful things...Of course, more important is the beautiful ideals. Too much access to the world is not necessarily a good thing. 
1	Finally, I waited for the discount of 300, but it was not so good when it went up by 50. It was still bought at 2949 with the coupon to offset it. It was very thoughtful with Rising Antivirus. 
1	Stayed many times, the location is convenient, and there are many places to eat around. The room is a bit small. 
1	The hardware of the hotel is good, the rooms are quite new, and the lobby is stylish, very suitable for foreign guests, although the location is a bit far from the city center. It would be more ideal if the front desk's service attitude were more enthusiastic. 
1	"It is somewhat redundant to ""icing on the cake"" for a widely acclaimed book. It is the wish of every reader to make people gain something. Otherwise, you don't have to read hard at the risk of myopia? ? HIT BOOK. Reading also has to choose, especially for young men and women who have a copy of Lian Yue is still a good choice. Emotions, if you try, you will gain---either happiness, joy, or pain, regret. To be precise, there are both. After reading Lian Yue's brilliant answer, he gradually felt a sense of clarity in his heart. like "
0	The delivery was not on time. The rest day was stated, but it arrived on a working day. And express delivery threatened to accept it. There was no response from the customer service complaint. Had to seek the help of the media. It seems that this is the last time I have been shopping in Dangdang. 
0	The only point is that the notebook film is not properly attached, and a lot of air is leaked. It is estimated that removing the film will be very beautiful. I am not willing to use it first. It is important to protect the notebook... 
0	The book was crumpled and crumpled when it was given to me, so ugly! Hope you can improve the quality of service! Who is happy to look like this! 
0	As soon as I got it, there was a bright spot in the middle of the screen, which was very dazzling. . . Not yet a PUMA platform. Fever is also quite big 
0	After I got this book, I felt that it was far from being as good as the advertisements said. The pictures were average, far from exquisite, and the content was a bit sloppy. It was not interesting for small children, but it felt painting for older children. Too many, in short, a little disappointed. 
1	The first visual discovery was that the kindergarten magazine I bought for my daughter had a page in each issue. It was only when my daughter liked it so much that I had a desire to buy it. I bought 8 copies at once. I didn’t dare to show it to her once when I went home. I took one out every other time. My daughter couldn’t put it down. I just happened to be sick at home these few days. I just held it all day long. Grandma was very unhappy. , I'm afraid the child's eyes are tired. I don’t know if reading this book for a long time will make my eyes tired, but in short, I don’t feel regret after buying it. I am happy to see my daughter like it. 
0	It's too tasteless. It seems that the rankings should be pretty good, but I didn't expect it to be so boring and empty, no one would be able to tell the truth, it's too boring, not to mention the general truth is still... how to put it, people dare to agree. 
0	There is a call in the evening! ! One word, annoying! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
0	The house price is still a bit expensive, if the house price is 200, it will be fine. 
1	The order was placed at 17:00, and the goods were received at 9 o’clock the next day. The delivery speed was praised. I especially like Little Red Riding Hood, and the whole machine is more atmospheric. Excellent heat dissipation. Perfect screen. The piano paint allows you to travel without a mirror. 
1	When I first came into contact with Durala, I didn't know what human resources are. Now I and the graduate student who decided to take the human resources major, of course, not just because of Durala, but I discovered my strong interest in human resources. 2 is just as good, just like 1. He talked about the joys, sorrows, sorrows, or involuntary in the workplace, even though I have not yet entered the society. But it is a completely social person. Secular thoughts, sleek life skills. There are also the shadows of people around you, you can find a similar person in Dulala 
1	ASUS’s big brand has good heat dissipation. It’s not hot after a long time. I bought it at 4799, which is worth the price. 
1	This book is impeccable from the production point of view, beautifully printed, and a thick book is only more than twenty yuan! It can be used as an introductory book of Feng Shui, which has a preliminary reflection on the basic principles of Feng Shui and the status of various Feng Shui theories. But to go deeper, you must choose a school of professional books to do special research. After all, Feng Shui is divided into schools, and it can't be like a hodgepodge! The views of various schools and schools are sometimes contradictory. Only when one is proficient in Feng Shui theory can one learn from each other's strengths, but by then it is already in the realm of a master, ha ha! 
0	"It feels like a liberal arts student reading a textbook of ""Advanced Mathematics"". The running account is average, but the background is very good. I chose to write such an inspiring story in such an era of fierce competition, and the writing is not good. "
0	The second time I went to live with the dog, the security said that I could not go in. I told my friend to take it away later. The security had no further comments, and the front desk did not give any prompts. Check in was smooth. Since entering the room, he has been under constant care. 1. Knock on the door in one minute and tell them to remember to take the dog out; 2. Call in five minutes and tell them to take the dog out; 3. Call in ten minutes and tell them to see the dog out; 4. Fifteen minutes Later, if they did not see the dog out, they should enter the room to check; 5. After 20 minutes, I would call again and I asked to check out; 6. After 30 minutes, the phone told me to charge RMB 100! 7. After forty minutes, the friend took the dog out. ps: During the period, the dog did not make any sound, as if it was a dumb dog. Would not choose this hotel again. 
1	I hope the publisher can publish another book about the Golden Decade of the Kuomintang 
1	The performance is not bad, the workmanship is also very exquisite, the performance is also good, the system is replaced with all the drivers of XP, and the operation is very smooth! 
0	The order placed on the 17th was urgently used on the 20th (friend's birthday), so I gave up the anti-virus software as a gift, otherwise I could not pick up the goods. I heard that the gift is out of stock. 
1	1. Beautiful appearance. 2. High cost performance, strong Dolby surround sound. 3. The warranty has changed from one year to two years! 3. 
0	The heat dissipation is average, and the fan sound is slightly louder! The manual is a bit too simple and not practical, so you have to explore it yourself! 
1	"Fujian Shanshui Hotel 1. It seems reasonable to upgrade to 4★, and the service is good (personal reception and laundry can be delivered in a timely manner); 2. The preserved egg and lean meat porridge for breakfast is good (although the third morning is a bit mushy ); 3. The catering on the second floor is worth recommending (when entertaining customers); 4. The equipment is relatively complete, there is a chess and card room, although I did not go to play mahjong, the environment is OK; 5. The location is good, the window is actually opposite- Intercontinental hotel, but taking a taxi is much more convenient than intercontinental; 6. The internet speed of the room is good, with 600KB/s; 7. What is not enough: A. Fuzhou hotels seem to have the same problem-the room is large, but the toilet is relatively small. Especially the size of the toilet...; B. There is no business package for the catering on the second floor, and the result is wasteful (calculated at 50 yuan for a single person). This suggestion has been given, and I don’t know if it will be improved. C. The sound insulation of the room windows is relatively poor . I live on the 16th floor. A small typhoon hits the first day and the windows shook overnight. During the second day and the third day, a car sirens downstairs went into the sky like a seizure...Fortunately, there is a small speaker in the room, which is turned on to 3/4 of the volume to play rock and roll, and it feels pretty good... D. Obvious problems: When the checkout was over at noon on the 8th, there was only one person at the checkout place (and still busy counting the ""bill statement""), but there were three people at the reception desk at the same counter. There were no Check-in guests, but the 3 people received were ""indifferent""... (In order to rush back to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, I had to ask them to expedite or come to help by one person) As a result, I encountered problems with card swiping. I’m not in a hurry, but the one at the checkout will only swipe the card from left to right n times (completely ignoring the system’s ""error reminder""). I reminded me again and again to read ""please see what the error message is."" The balance is insufficient. I had to go back to the room and the business center to transfer the funds twice. The result was that the card was incorrectly swiped. After I came back, I asked the bank counter for consultation and found out: because the card was swiped too frequently in a short time, the bank protection locked the card... Actually: noon It was originally when there were a lot of Check Out people (from the beginning of the checkout to the end of the checkout, there were four guests checking out, but no one was checking in), the front desk staffing was obviously unreasonable; if the lesbian at the checkout was more careful, When you find that there is a problem with the card swiping, read the tips more, it will not delay the guests so much time, and will not cause the card to be locked (the good color is like an arrow to watch the opening ceremony, CheckOut 1 hour in advance, otherwise...); When you have a problem, please calm down and deal with it. It's actually more anxious than me (especially her voice is high, sharp and fast). If I am as anxious as her, it will be blamed if I don't fight... Of course, the hotel service From the beginning to the end, including the final handling of the card problem, I knew that I would change to another receptionist to handle it. The service attitude is still acceptable. Generally speaking, this hotel is still worth recommending, and I hope to make further progress. Finally, the price of Ctrip is a bit more expensive than the price I heard at the front desk. Although I accepted the price difference and moved in, Ctrip, please come on! "
1	"I have read too many traverse texts from the four-fourth and fourteenth period, and I came across this book about Huang Taiji and was quite interested. The author upholds the consistent style, imagines and fictionalizes historical facts, a bit like ""Luan"", all of which have first passed through other people's bodies, and after the previous body has gone, they have passed through again, and come again with the hero . Huang Taiji only loves Youran from beginning to end, whether it is the Dongge who wears the title of Jurchen's No. 1 Beauty, or the real step of leisure, love thoroughly and lingering. I admire the author's spirit of earnestly studying history. Sigh one. "
1	Bought at 3999, the configuration is good. Now you can also use your points to redeem a Yuedu.com and a Qiaoqiao English card on the Tongfang website. Of course it is not worth the name 600. 
1	After reading a part, I feel that I probably have a lot of problems. By contrast, I feel that my parents are also having problems. I feel that the entire Chinese society is pathological. There have been many things in the family recently, including a terminally ill little uncle, an extremely crazy aunt, and a year-round sick aunt. I think they are probably all mentally ill, facing illnesses, injuries, and unhealed for a long time, so It consumes the whole family's happy life, lives in hardship, and cannot get rid of poverty. It is really scary to think about it this way, and everything around me is scary. 
0	It is relatively heavy and squeezed in the original packaging. The audio is not as good as expected. The screen is indeed in the first week of 2006, and the color is average, not as good as the current LED, but it's okay. The sever 2003 driver is incomplete. 
1	I bought the lacquered notebook for the first time, and it looks better than I thought. My friends also said that thinkpad is also the first to buy. It is the same as I thought, and the quality is good. There is little heat and no noise, I think it’s worth it 
0	The logo on the B side is relatively hot. The power transformer is a bit hot. It's a bit heavy, and I'm tired when I go out. 
1	The appearance is outstanding, and the keyboard is very intimate and comfortable in the netbook. In addition, Jingdong's delivery speed is really nothing to say. Arrived the next day. It's in place 
1	I just received the book, yes, yes, I especially like the passage on the back cover: they wear almost all famous brands, but their bank deposits are almost zero; they all have good academic qualifications, but not necessarily all. High income; they work harder than the locals, but live as good as the locals. They are-pharmaceutical sales representatives. Very insightful! ! ! 
1	Very good, it has been five months since I got it. It’s not bad after spending this time. Very fast, low sound, low temperature. There is no quality problem. There are many advantages, for example, it can play 1080P full HD, the speed is not worse than T2390, and it is quieter when working. 
1	It is for the performance of the battery. It can be used for more than 5 hours to watch a movie, and it should be longer with the power saving mode. The overall workmanship of the machine is good, and the keyboard is very comfortable to use. 
0	I can't find a worse adjective to describe this book. I thought it was humorous, but it turned out to be all jokes. Is it funny? Throw away 
0	The earphone and USB are on the right hand, which slightly affects the use of the mouse; because there is no CD-ROM drive as standard, students who are accustomed to using CD-ROMs suggest to buy another USB one in case of emergency. 
0	It is estimated that it is the difference between Chinese and foreign cultures. Anyway, I don't feel anything particularly good, and the animal shape is not cute, which is far from the Camilla series! Let's consider it carefully. 
0	I stayed in room 802 on the 16th, and there was rumbling noise throughout the night, like an elevator, but also like moving furniture upstairs for physical exercise. It was not obvious when I sat up, and when my head hit the pillow, it looked like I was resting on the stereo. I didn't sleep well all night. I originally planned to run away for 3 days the next morning. Hotel Feedback January 22, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable comments. Please forgive me for the inconvenience caused by the hotel’s emergency repairs that night. If you have any questions about the room, please call the front desk of the hotel. The front desk of the hotel will serve guests wholeheartedly. You are welcome to stay at Zhongnan Seaside Hotel again and give your valuable suggestions. 
0	"It’s not good, it feels very bad, especially the service attitude. The guests come in and do not pay attention to it. They didn’t say “Welcome to come again next time” when they left. There was basically no smile on the face of the waiter, especially the restaurant, I can only use it. I’m sorry to describe the word ""very bad"", because I really can’t find a more appropriate vocabulary. When dining on the second floor, the waiter said most of all, ""Eat well, don’t waste"" and ""I’m sorry, We ran out of food"", I checked the watch, it was only 6:40, and dinner time was over at 7:00, so there was no food so early, so it was called ""restaurant""? Later, I caught a glimpse of a sign, which said: If the food is not finished, the charge is over 100g/10 yuan. Is your meal made of gold? The rice was cold and heated with a micro-boiler. The waiter kept saying ""One minute is enough, one minute is enough"". I was thinking that we paid for the entrance, not to be angry. Not to hear you complain about ""food is expensive now, we can't afford to buy food"", so I suggest that if you don't want to exercise your mental endurance or mental quality, I would not recommend this hotel "
0	Perhaps it has not reached the realm of the author? The discussion about the grievances with his second brother can only show that the author is a typical entrepreneur with Chinese characteristics. Does not have the awakening effect of the world. I dislike this paragraph very much. I'm not interested in reading this book. This is a book that I have failed to buy. 
0	The overall feeling that the hotel is relatively small, from the lobby, elevators, corridors, guest rooms to the bathroom are relatively small, the most intolerable is the small toilet, the urine can hardly be carried out at the same time, there is a risk of infectious diseases. The wallpaper in the guest room is badly broken, and the parking lot guests still charge for it, which feels bad. It is recommended that the hotel change that little toilet as soon as possible, otherwise no one would dare to move in. 
0	The book was later bought. The son of two years and five months listened carefully to me before going to bed. For the son who doesn't like books, this book is the right one. It is one of the few books he likes to count. 
1	The performance of the notebook is sufficient for office use, the screen is clear, the keyboard feels good, and the interface is basically intact. I don't know what the quality is, it depends on time. Worry for a month. 
0	Room 428 does not even have a window, and the soundproofing effect of the room is too poor. I always hear the sound of talking next door and the sound of flushing in the bathroom next door at night. Will not live again next time. 
0	The smell is really bad, unacceptable! ! ! The picture is too messy, my son over 2 years old will definitely not like it, I don't even bother to watch it. Regardless of the chick's personality, you must first be interested in watching it! Failure to buy! ! 
0	I feel that this story is not as attractive to me as in the introduction, but it is definitely not a relationship far away from my life in that era. The protagonists in the incident are too mythical. The whole story is like love words between people who are in love. It is definitely an expression of a very self-state. I don’t like it very much and I am not very moved. The story is too beautiful and there is no defect. I can't feel real anymore~ 
1	"The plot is very good and beautiful. Many of my classmates say it is very beautiful, but I think that a good book also has many themes, but the secondary is also very important. I think there are many in the life of a person. Things are not just love. One of my classmates said that there are fewer things at the end, and I personally think that I feel that I am missing the love of the heroine. You said that it feels too monotonous. I am looking forward to the ""Surrogate Mother"". I read the previous book and I think it is better than what you wrote before. There are things in it. The content is richer and the characters are real. This shows that your pen is mature. Come on! "
0	1. It's too thick, I don't know when it can be as light and thin as S101, but the price is not so expensive. 2. Because of the promotion, I chose white. If it can be changed to black, it would be fine. 3. The C drive uses more than 80G, no Knowing that if some space is divided, will it have an adverse effect on the automatic recovery system? 
1	This book is great. I bought the first book at Xinhua Bookstore. Although it is expensive, it is very good. The author writes about nature with emotion, and the reader seems to be a small animal in the field, with a sense of being on the scene. Moreover, the writing is beautiful, knowledgeable, interesting, and literary. Later, he bought a full set for the child Books, children can't put it down. It can be interpreted from a 7-year-old mother to an 18-year-old child. Learn about nature, love animals, understand their lives, and love them more. 
0	I forgot to add one point: the author of this book has a problem with his brain. When he speaks nonsense, one can tell that the author is an idiot by looking at the language of the book. It is ridiculous that there are many scriptures quoted in it, which seems to be added by the editor. It is strongly recommended that the author be brought to justice, and the irresponsible publishing house should be directly taken over by the state. This is too harmful, a typical pseudo-science. 
0	It’s enough for Dai Zong’s Samsung to learn once. This is the case. This kind of hotel should be immediately removed from Ctrip’s cooperative customers. Ctrip should give us the best recommendation instead of the so-called Samsung, which is inferior to the guest house. , We can't believe that Ctrip's recommendation is not worth it. 
1	Small size; six-cell battery lasts for a long time, estimated to last 6-7 hours; metal incense silver, brushed workmanship; good heat dissipation, working for a period of time without feeling soup; fan sound 
0	The soundproofing is too poor, and someone talking in the corridor is like talking in your own room. The door of the room does not close smoothly. Push hard. The waiter is indifferent, and the front desk clerk can't even speak English. General hygiene. 
1	For the configuration at this price, it is very good, the upper cover unexpectedly is royal blue, which looks exquisite. The keyboard design has also changed from ACER I have seen before 
1	I have always thought that practicing yoga is a thing of all benefits but no harm. Later, it was seen on the Internet that incorrect yoga movements could cause unexpected injuries. For example, some yoga instructors pursued some difficult movements excessively, causing joint, ligament or muscle damage. It made me determined to buy a book about the structure of human bones and muscles. The complete solution to the key muscles of Hatha Yoga meets this need. The color pictures and partitions introduce the bones and muscles of the human body, as well as the muscles and bones triggered by yoga movements. The fly in the ointment is that yoga moves a little bit less. 
1	"How can people who have not experienced the vicissitudes of this book read this book? The hermit was disappointed in the world before he went to live in seclusion. He wanted to pursue a better world, but he left the ugly world and lost the ability to pursue a better heaven. Among the three ""truth\good\beauty"", only ""true"" is the closest to heaven, and the robber has only ""true"". He never cheats or deceives others, but he is neither good nor beautiful. The hermit symbolizes ""goodness"" and monster symbolizes ""Beauty"", you try to figure out the author's inscription-""To the child of truth"", who is the child of truth? True? Good? Beautiful? Hey, this is a little thought "
0	More than half a month has passed, I haven't received the book yet? ? what happened? ? ? ? When will I receive the book? ? ? ? 
1	Response speed: It only took a few days from placing an online order to receiving the book. I was really happy, and there were fewer worries! Content: colorful and full of imagination, very suitable for my 3-year-old daughter to study. Haha, I also looked at the packaging very carefully: too simple, a Dangdang plastic bag containing 8 books tied with a rope, it feels not very suitable for the book. The book is so beautiful. Glue binding: The glue binding method is easy to degummed, which is not conducive to storage. The cover of my book took off within a day after taking it home. But in general, it's really good. My daughter and I love it! 
0	The difficulty of words is much worse, some are very commonly used and some do not need to be known at all. They can't enhance the memory after reading them, which is boring. 
1	I also read your comments before deciding to buy this book for my three-year-old daughter. This is also my first time buying a book in Dangdang. Although she is four years old, some of the content is easier for her daughter to learn, and some are a little difficult to understand, so take your time. What my daughter is most interested in is the learning content with stickers. Every time she takes the initiative to learn, and first chooses the content with stickers to learn. By the way, she also learned the word stickers. A set of books worth buying 
1	"I bought it for a one-year-old and nine-month-old cub. At first I thought it would be too difficult. I didn’t expect that the caterpillars on the first page immediately attracted the child’s attention. Since then, the cubs will pester me every day. I took him to post the caterpillars together, and within half a month, all the books were posted. I usually don’t want me, but since I have this set of books, I will come to my face every day and say ""good mother, post the caterpillars"". Hehe, I really want to thank you for this set of books! Like books, I prefer the feeling of holding cubs and reading books together! "
0	Generally speaking, this book is okay, but there are some parts that I don’t know very well, such as not knowing the approximate location by acupuncture points. 
1	This configuration is not easy at this price. The workmanship is good, but in fact it is still good. Heat control is good 
1	The room is good, I will continue to stay next time I have the opportunity. The price can be even cheaper. 
0	The overall feeling is not as good as IdeaPad's books. The USB setting is unreasonable. The optical drive and the power supply are on one side, it is inconvenient to open the optical drive 
0	I bought a book worth more than 600 yuan for this order and received the goods soon, but my five sets of baby bears were not shipped at all, and they were missed. Two weeks have passed and I haven't dealt with it yet. Disappointed! 
1	"I used to suffer from weakness, fatigue, laziness, lethargy, and inactivity. I always thought it was a physical problem, but after reading a health book, I realized that there was a problem with my diet. If the diet is adjusted properly Now, none of the above problems will arise, so I think this ""Eat This Way is the Healthyest"" is very suitable for us modern people. It allows us to learn how to maintain our bodies to the best condition and how to eat healthy in the busy work. , I think medicine tonic is not as good as food tonic, and eating healthy is the healthiest. So quickly buy it home, as your own health treasure, ha ha. "
1	I heard that this book is very well written. After I got it, I simply searched through the catalog and found that my usual eating habits are really a bit problematic. After I followed the instructions on daily life and diet, the two weeks were really better than before. My complexion is much better. My parents also made Guyuan Ointment. Now I insist on taking it every day. Diet therapy is the best way to protect and treat diseases. I also recommend many dietary concerns to my friends. Haha, everyone still thinks I know a lot, but I actually learned it from this book. If you don't want to get sick, just read this book. it's actually very good! 
1	The service is generally very good, and the service can be easily obtained through the room phone, and the price is competitive. There is a regret: the hotel is not very convenient to take a taxi; at the same time, the hotel canceled the airport BUS, which is somewhat inconvenient for guests. 
0	Want to change my review of this book! ! Because of it! ! I read this book carefully again! ! By the way, this book was recommended by the teacher! ! It was really boring to read before! ! BUT! ! Now I find that although the style is not suitable for me, the writing should be ok! ! 
1	The price-performance ratio is relatively high, the appearance of the machine is good, and the performance is not bad. Mainly because the built-in vista system is too slow, it takes a lot of time to install xp. 
0	There is less focus and more nonsense, and more personal feeling. This is the reason for the length of the book. There are too many unrealistic things in it. If we are so rich, wouldn’t we protect ourselves? Everything is nonsense. , Anyone can write such a book. 
0	"Very useful for children, but for me, I think I bought the wrong book. ""College student friend"" refers to freshman students such as high school students, junior high school students, not college students. Dangdang's service is still very good, like one. "
0	"I am very afraid of many books that are ""considered as classics"", because many of them have too many artificial factors: like KFC and McDonald's, the best bought is not the best to eat. But because I wonder why it has so many good reviews, I bought it. As I feared, this book is really ""classic"". For me, his destination can only be the wastebasket or the second-hand book market. "
1	The hotel’s service is good. I went to a booked deluxe double room. Later, because there was no room type I booked, I was automatically upgraded to a business suite. This is still more comfortable. In addition, breakfast is okay now. It is because it is not far from the airport that the aircraft noise is relatively loud. Hotel Feedback March 14, 2008: Dear guest, hello, thank you very much for your recognition of the service and breakfast of Xiamen Lixuan Hotel. We have been improving the software service of the hotel. In addition to the noise problem, the hotel was renovated in May 2007, which largely solved the noise problem. Welcome your next visit! 
1	The room is very old, parking charge 10 yuan a night, service attitude is ok 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the battery is very good! The appearance is beautiful, the battery is very good! The appearance is beautiful, the battery is very good! The appearance is beautiful, the battery is very good! 
1	Small size, long battery life with 6 cores, first-rate workmanship and hand feel, speed is mainly for work and watching movies, which is enough. I haven't tried wireless Internet access yet. My mobile phone has a monthly subscription of GPRS, and I will use Bluetooth ftp to connect. It is estimated to be slow enough. The weight is heavier than the average netbook, but it is acceptable. 
0	This hotel is really bad, the room facilities are similar to the two-star hotel. The shower room was really dirty, the floor was full of black spots, and I didn't know what it was. The disposable slippers packaging has been broken off, a little bit dirty, as if it had been used. Fortunately, I brought my own disposable slippers, otherwise I would have to walk around the room in high-top shoes, which makes me uncomfortable to think of. The lady at the front desk was also expressionless, as if someone owed her money. The front desk is really far from the room, which is extremely inconvenient. The air conditioner is very loud, and even if it’s turned on to 30 degrees, it doesn’t feel heating. Fortunately, the network cable is a bit long, so you can sit on the bed and use the computer. 
0	Full of horrible metaphors For example: using toothpaste mixed with blood to describe the color of a string of pink pearls, why is it so embarrassing? ! 
0	I don't think there is anything good, there are many things that are deliberately fabricated. Such as cucumber carts and corn carts. Where are these stuff? 
0	The name of Dangdang does not match the truth, and the order will not be delivered for many days. Asking the customer service will only defer, and will only ask the user to place another order. Such service can't keep customers. It is better to go to other websites to buy books. 
1	"The breakfast is very good. It is close to the city center and convenient for shopping, but the room in Building 5 is equivalent to a 3-star standard. However, it is also worth the price relative to the room price. Supplementary review August 11, 2008: In addition, the slippers provided in the room are too small to wear at all. Are they designed for women? I'm 42 feet. Hotel feedback August 14, 2008: Dear guest: Hello! Thank you for staying at Jinling Liyang Hotel! And let us know your feelings and opinions in time! Regarding the question that the slippers you raised are too small. When you next stay at Jinling Liyang Hotel, just ask our waiter. We will record special needs based on your comments and provide you with satisfactory service! , Carry forward the service concept of Jinling Liyang Hotel ""Customer First"", so that every guest can leave a beautiful and deep impression on Jinling Liyang Hotel. Thank you again! welcome next time! I wish you success in your work! Healthy body! Director of Guest Relations at Jinling Liyang Hotel "
0	Staying for the first time, I feel very bad. The attitude of the hotel staff is not good, and they are strongly dissatisfied! How is it rated as five stars? When checking out, I encountered a hotel that had to toss back and forth between two counters to check out! This is my first stay, and it will be the last! Goodbye! 
1	"In modern life, drinking, smoking, surfing the Internet, staying up late, etc. are inevitable. Many bad habits slowly invade our body without paying attention. If we lack health care knowledge, we will be healthy after ignoring many cues from the body. Is far away from me. ""Special Effect Acupoint User Manual"" is like a health doctor, teaching us various ways to cope with discomfort, telling us many details to pay attention to. I like this book very much. After the first purchase, I also bought it for my parents. Filial piety does not lie in material manifestation. I think it is particularly important to ask my parents an invisible health doctor! "
0	The hotel room facilities are outdated, especially the bathroom settings are unreasonable, and the bathing is very inconvenient. The front desk staff was extremely cold. 
1	The goods arrived very quickly this time. It seems that the free express delivery has improved. At this price, this brand configuration is excellent value for money. 
1	I stayed on October 2nd. The facilities in all aspects are not bad. There is free BUS in the hotel very close to Taikoo Shing, which is worth it! 
0	Bad service! Service consciousness is very bad. I booked a double breakfast room, but only one breakfast was given. When I had breakfast, I was told that I went to the front desk and my attitude was stiff, as if the guests were all liars. As a result, the breakfast is very simple... The hotel tour guide is 100 yuan a day. When in scenic spots, I always urge you to hurry up... and always take you to places where you need to spend, such as burning incense (burning high incense), fortune-telling, please amulet, consecration..., every few hundred yuan, even several thousand yuan ...... (But I am determined not to buy it!) 
0	The appearance is OK, the system is really difficult to install, the LINUX system can’t install the GHOST version of XP at all, and it drops 100 when you buy 
1	I got it today. It feels good after installing VISTA. It is smooth enough. The video memory has been changed to 128. I ran CINEBENCHR10 and the score was not low at 1804. 
0	Everyone should pay attention when looking at this. The memory you send must be installed by yourself. Go to THINKPAD customer service and they are not responsible for the maintenance of Jingdong products. Go to Jingdong customer service and say that the R400 memory is not easy to install and may be damaged. Finally, I will remove it myself. , Install it yourself. In the future, warranty becomes a problem 
1	The overall feeling is four stars at best, not five stars at all. Especially the food in the western restaurant on the second floor is really not flattering. It is not like western food at all. The taste needs to be improved and there are few varieties. The environment is a bit messy, and the only advantage may be cheap. 
0	I am more interested in psychology, and then I saw that it was the top best seller, so after I bought two books and read them, I felt indescribable. This psychologist has some problems with his character, and he can do whatever he can to achieve his goal. . . . Very general, although the plot is quite mysterious, but it doesn’t feel very exciting 
1	The service is good, the dining is good, the room in Building A should be refurbished. Additional comment February 20, 2008: I feel generally inferior to Yuanfei Hotel 
1	For most of ordinary people, it is enough, cost-effective, and there is nothing to say. If you like it, buy it quickly. Digital China's after-sales service, I am afraid of counting. . . . 
0	I saw Yu Dan on TV and admired her eloquence and thinking, so I bought this book, but I was a little disappointed. The principle of being a person and doing things in the book is very pertinent, but the connection between public opinion and language feels far-fetched. It is just a feeling in the name of the Analects. Expressing personal feelings. I regret buying it. 
0	I can be sure that the author has read some historical materials, and I am more sure that the author’s literary skills are slightly insufficient. This book has no historical reference and no literary beauty. So I asked myself why it is a waste of my time. I personally prefer Yi Zhongtian. Pin San Guo>So I don’t like the type of this book very much 
1	"Martin Luther studied in the middle school history book, but he felt as if he had no contact with us. It was not until I believed in Jesus that I knew what his contribution to Christianity was. The truth of justification by faith is indeed worthy of a big book. Throughout this book, Martin Luther's simple style of writing makes people feel uncomfortable. At first glance, it seems to be a theological work, but when you read it, you will find that it is a book like a conversation between friends. The style is very simple and the author is knowledgeable. Rich, there is no lack of humor, I like the ""Christmas Book"" among them. "
1	I stayed at this hotel in August 2007. The environment and service are good, but there is no gift compote that Ctrip said. Although it is not a big deal, it would be better not to write it without this gift. 
0	"I bought this book and ""Tom Rabbit"" at the same time, this book really can not read, of course its paper and printing are impeccable. The pictures are too cumbersome, and the viewers are upset; the text is even more incomprehensible, and it is not the Chinese speaking at all. The strange thing is that its rating is high, I even doubt my reading level, or my children like it? To be honest, my child only likes the image of the ""little black cat"" and knows that he is afraid of the ""big monster"". But ""Rabbit"" is very popular with my children. As a family, I hope that it does not mislead others. "
0	The sound insulation is too poor, and the sound transmission effect of Sanhe board is better. The price during the Golden Week is twice as high as usual, which obviously feels cheated. Especially when I heard 260 from someone else at checkout, mine turned out to be 370! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	In a few days, I still choose to stay in this hotel. 
0	I went to live here after reading Ctrip's evaluation and was extremely disappointed after staying. I hurried to Ctrip to post comments to remind latecomers not to be deceived again. I really don’t know how Ctrip’s comments came out, and I strongly suspect that there is trust. The five-star hotel is said to have been opened in 200*, but the rooms are extremely old, there are large stains on the carpet (the hotel manager says it can’t be washed out), the wallpaper comes off, and the doors are not closed tightly. Dirty and insecure. I locked the door, but when the waiter knocked on the door, I forgot to pull the door and the locking device was pulled down. I heated the pot of water (there is no free bottled water), and when I poured it into the water glass, the water glass cracked. The waiter said it might have been too long. 
0	1. Heavy, a bit tired with a shoulder bag 2. The system is Linux, it doesn't matter if you install the win system by yourself, but you have to download the driver from the official website, speechless 3. The heat dissipation is good, and it is quiet. But the D-side touchpad is easier to accumulate heat, and it feels a little hotter than the hard disk. 
1	[Recommendation] Many people have been busy searching for their own happiness throughout their lives, but they have neglected the happiness around them! Some people want to find their childhood, some people want to forget their childhood, no matter the situation, you can find that feeling in the Lost Garden, Every time I feel sad, I will take out this book to comfort myself! I can get peace of mind in it. I recommend this book to hope that all friends like Paradise Lost can find happiness and forget the pain. Please believe that there will be light behind the darkness! 
0	Staying during the Spring Festival, I feel that the hardware environment is still so-so, but the hotel service is too poor. It is called a hot spring resort, but there are no discounts and priority measures for hotel guests. 1. In-house guests and non-resident guests need to buy hot spring tickets, and if they want to go to the hot springs at night and the next morning, they also need to buy two hot spring tickets. It is reasonable for the in-house guests to go to the hot springs. Green channel, otherwise it’s meaningless to stay in the resort. 2. You need to change the key at the front desk when you go to the hot spring. When I went to change the key, there were many non-residents who came to the hot spring lined up. I told the front desk that we should stay in the hotel. The guests have priority, but the lady at the front desk was unwilling. I finally gave me priority after a few words. This is really outrageous. I can't get the service I deserve when I stay in their hotel. 3. The service consciousness at the front desk is weak. I asked when I checked in. Can the lady at the front desk check out a little later the next day and ask her to ask the manager, but after asking the manager, she didn’t answer me at all. When I asked her, she said that because she had already left, I stood in front of her ! In short, this hot spring resort is really disdainful, and the quality of service is definitely not worthy of its appearance, and I will not choose it again in the future. 
0	The service attitude of the hotel is very poor, the facilities are very poor, it is recommended not to go there. 
1	"Supplement: I know how to put the disc. Let it play automatically, up to the last video file stored in it. Go directly to ""My Computer"", open the folder ""MPEGAV"" where the video is placed in the CD, and then you can see all the video files and play them. My second disc can be used on one computer, but not on another computer. Fortunately, video files can be copied directly to the computer for viewing. "
0	I have always been buying books and I don’t like listening to bookstores. I have never planned to buy this book, but I have been hungry on Dangdang. Every time I buy a book, I recommend this book and I want to buy it again. . I can't stand it after reading less than 50 pages. It's a complete crap. . . . . This can be said to be the worst book I have bought since I bought it. 
1	The price is not high, relatively affordable, the service is also good, not far from the downtown area. The traffic is also more convenient. 
1	It is close to the company, so I chose this 3-star hotel. The price of catering is very competitive, close to ordinary restaurants.

1	Lukács’ philosophical thoughts are rich and chaotic, and he has a strong speculative logical deduction. Therefore, it is not important to read his monographs, like books, but also to read the original works. In the original works, you can better understand the kind of Lukacs. Strong, fire-like revolutionary passion and logical evolution charm. Although he has the legacy of Hegel's speculation, and even the tendency and suspicion towards pure speculation, in the context of his history, his thoughts cannot be matched by the orthodox Marxists. This book is the rectification of Lukács in the context of history. Read it if you like Lukács. 
0	Quite average hotel, the road in front of the hotel is quite noisy, the price is not high, not recommended 
1	The bed in the deluxe double room is very big. A single bed is already as big as the double bed I live in Hong Kong. Some details are also quite interesting, like the small envelope on the bedside will have a candy and will tell you tomorrow The weather. The towels are a bit old. There is no line for drying clothes in the bathroom. Additional comment February 28, 2007: The outside is a bit old and dirty. When we first arrived, we were still hesitating whether to change one. Later we saw The inside is still good, it's time to decorate the outside 
1	"I was attracted by this author because of ""White Night"" and bought this book by accident. You can't leave it as soon as you open your sight. To hold back fatigue for it last night, this afternoon, taking advantage of work is not busy, hiding in Yidi secretly read it. The wounds of young people are too easy to bury the root of the curse, and the hate that grows from this is not the powerful wave hidden deep in the seabed, because it always appears in all the small details of life, but people don’t pay much attention to it. Any details of this matter. The acquiescence may be an acknowledgment in some sense, but there may also be some secrets hidden behind it. "
0	This book is general. It doesn't mean anything. There is little content in the title part. Others are scattered other content. 
1	I remember that he liked it very much when he was holding a book to talk to a three and a half year old. When I told him that the two friends are very good and caring for each other, he told me that he also has good friends and is willing to share the set of books he just bought with friends. Children nowadays are all only children and are very selfish. What this set of books just tells us is to cherish friendship and learn to share happiness with others. Therefore, I suggest that for your own children, you can buy this book for him to read, teach him to share happiness with others from elementary school, cherish friendship, childhood friendship is the most memorable. 
1	The beach is a bit over-famous, and it is a bit farther away, and the traffic is inconvenient, but the hotel itself is very good. At the Peninsula Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui (on the side close to the Hong Kong YMCA), there is the Gold Coast Hotel’s own shuttle bus, which is free of charge (there is a charge upstairs, which may be due to poor communication with the driver). The schedule can be downloaded from the hotel's website (, other means of transportation are not recommended, this is my advice! There are supermarkets, tea restaurants and McDonald's nearby, if the requirements are not high, eating is no problem. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the battery is strong, the keyboard feels good, and the configuration is relatively good. It is enough to surf the Internet at ordinary times, and it can play 1080p HD smoothly. It also has an xp system pre-installed. 
0	Lived for one day last month. When booking the room at the front desk, it was said that it was a double room, 198 yuan, room 2321, went in and found that it was a double standard room, returned to the front desk, changed to room 3101, it is a double room, the front desk staff personally filled out the exchange form, and indicated The exchanged room and price were 188 yuan, and I was asked to sign, but the list was not given to me. The next day’s checkout was 208 yuan. I said that the exchange bill had clearly stated the price. They denied it. I asked them to show me the sign exchange form, but they said that there was no more. The 198 yuan of the price on the earliest check-in list (room 2321) was crossed out and changed to 208 yuan. Their deceptive attitude is so well practiced, no matter how anxious I am, they are also a peaceful shaman. I have to dare to time, so I have to pay and leave. It can only be said that this store is really clever for a mere 20 yuan. As for the quality of the room, it is average, but the location may be good in Chongqing, but it is definitely not recommended. If you must stay, please be careful and keep all the evidence, especially the things to be signed. They will not help you If you save it, you must be careful. 
1	The environment and service are quite good. The biggest shortcoming is that it is very inconvenient to call in the morning. Often need to wait 10 minutes 
0	Unlike a three-star hotel, when you arrive on the floor, you can see dirty and cracked wallpaper at a glance. The equipment in the room is very old, the sanitary conditions are poor, the colors of towels and toilets are yellow, and the shower water is too small. , Like entering a guest house... 
1	Professor Lang’s views are unique and sharp. Although he is sometimes extreme, he still makes good sense. For those of us who are deeply influenced by education and culture in the Mainland, reading this book has not only improved our knowledge of economics and finance, but more importantly, we should understand some of China’s current economic hotspots from a different perspective. Some comparisons between Hong Kong, Japan and Hong Kong have found our existing problems and gaps. The feeling after reading it is quite enjoyable, and I will continue to pay attention to it in the future! 
1	I have been to Fujian more recently, and I always stayed at the Manhattan Jianlian Hotel, because the first time I lived was a good one. I stayed in a business room. Although the room is not big, the items are complete, and the dolls on the bed make people have Feel at home and good service, 
1	"This book is all color pictures, the printing quality is exquisite, the price is not expensive, it is recommended! I thought it was a bit difficult for children in kindergarten, but after reading it, I found that the little guy likes it very much. Everyday little things can be used for experiments, such as ""the water that doesn’t fall, coins in water, and ice fishing."" ""Waiting for the experiment, he thought it was amazing, even our adults are interested, but some experiments are more suitable for older children. Personally, I feel that it is suitable for children from kindergarten to elementary school to do it by hand. "
1	After reading this book, I understand how irrational thoughts and actions each of us will have in our daily lives! I told my friends about the examples frequently cited in the book. They were all surprised that each of us would make so many low-level but seemingly normal mistakes in our lives or decision-making! At the same time, everyone feels that these simple examples benefit a lot. The language is simple and friendly, the truth is explained in simple terms, and the content is closely coherent. It is a good book that anyone can read in one go, and the more you read it, the more enjoyable it becomes. 
0	I bought the books for the ranking list. I don’t know why so many people commented very well, but for me, it’s tasteless. Why do you say that? First, if it is a book of determination, it cannot be mentioned. Second, if you talk about things that everyone encounters in the workplace, I think it's a marginal shot. Third, a little bit of the so-called love in the book is even weaker. Books are really not to my appetite. After reading it, I just put it aside, feeling that I won't go to read the second book again. 
1	I bought this book because this internship I want to go to the countryside with my teacher and go to Suizhou for investigation. I am going to do a topic on social interactions with left-behind women in rural areas, so I bought this book to learn more. After reading it, it was really touched. As the young male labor force moved to the city, the life of left-behind women began to undergo a qualitative change. There was joy and bitterness that was unknown. Recommend everyone to read this book, especially female readers. As women, we should feel more... 
0	The biggest advantage is that it is very close to the railway station, and it is very convenient to take a bus to the Longmen Grottoes, Guanlin Temple and other attractions. The hotel facilities are too old and the TV effect is poor. 
1	After taking the machine back, install the xp system. The driver can be installed directly with the attached disk. All the disks attached to the driver are contained in the disk, and they are all installed. Now you are surfing the Internet on wifi 
0	It’s been a long time since I bought books. Why haven’t the books I bought through Alipay arrived a week later than this, I really don’t know what’s going on? Have I been cheated by you! 
0	For me, December 10th is my hardest day. A four-star hotel does not turn on the air-conditioning at night when the temperature is only 13 degrees, and it is the hotel's regulations (internal documents), which is really unheard of. I don't know if the air conditioner is not turned on because there are no guests, or the guest is not turned on because the air conditioner is not turned on. I hope the hotel will reflect on it. I just want to suggest that Ctrip abolish the hotel’s agreement as soon as possible, so as not to suffer other guests and affect Ctrip’s reputation. Platinum VIP who froze all night 
1	"The second volume of ""Thirty Years of Surging"" brings us to the turn of the century, where the breath of the times is strong. Faced with the challenges of world-class companies and the dream of the world's top 500, what life choices Chinese entrepreneurs will make. With the deepening of reform and opening up, how will the order of China's market economy be maintained; how will the government and private enterprises play in the face of historical breakthroughs in the reform of property rights; how will people be in the face of the sudden emergence of the capital market Gradually get rid of the speculative mentality to standardize the imperfect system. All this depends on how the author reveals for us. "
0	It's just some simple truth, but it doesn't hurt for a woman to know more. Just look at the preface and postscript. 
0	Breakfast is 30, cannot be refunded, nor can it be expected, it is too unreasonable. I will not book this hotel in the future. The room is smelly and the decoration is too bad. 
1	The economy room was renovated later, it is smaller than the original room and only suitable for single person, because the bathroom is separated by frosted glass and there is no bathtub. 
0	Ctrip's recommendation was not very good. The room was cleaned after registration at the front desk, so I asked to wait in the lobby, but no one asked about it after waiting for an hour. After negotiating with the deputy manager of the lobby, I personally led the room into the room and said that I would give a gift to the room and wait for the check out. I didn't see the fruit delivered, if I don't deliver it, don't say it, I won't stay at this hotel next time. 
0	Neither the service nor the hardware can reach the four-star level, even though the front desk does have a four-star sign! ! ! In my opinion, it is less than 3 stars. But the price is also four stars. 
0	I have worked in two Fortune 500 multinational companies. Looking through this book, I can roughly restore the author’s true character and life state. People who haven't seen foreign companies in the tier cities are probably okay, and they will be completely ignored in Shanghai. 
1	Good appearance, fast speed, low price, fast delivery, and the deliveryman's attitude is very good, so he will accompany me to unpack the package on a hot day, thank you again 
1	I booked the Shuguang Villa room. After I checked in, I found that the room was very small and seemed to be very humid. The most annoying thing was that I found a mouse. Later, I added money and changed the standard room in the hotel. The dinner I used in the restaurant was pretty good, but the price was low, but after all, it was in the mountains. 
1	I decided on the hotel after reading the online reviews. I concluded that the advantages are that the transportation is convenient, and the transportation is convenient; the other is really almost! Not to mention the environment, the requirements were not high, but after I moved into the third floor, I found that the outside was a ventilation duct. Buzzing all night! Advise comrades not to choose three floors! The facilities are relatively aging, they belong to the five-star middle-aged and need to be renovated! The rooms are basically not ventilated and lighted! The living is more awkward! In short, I added a lot Yinzi, living in a bad mood! Regret... (just came back from Hongkong today...) 
1	The configuration is still possible, and the price is considered high cost performance! The heat dissipation is good, only the bottom surface is a little hot after several hours of continuous use. 
0	She is a rare and successful media person. Why must she write 15 words? For this book, there is nothing to write about? ? 
0	There is a lot of time and nothing to do; if you have a lot of money and nothing to buy, then buy a copy. At least you can have a psychological comfort. I feel that with it, you can control your 20-year-old and plan your own For a lifetime. In fact, after reading it, you will only feel that it is like a mother whispering in your ear, it is of no use, and it is thrown away, but it is clean. 
0	"Please cancel the 10 yuan coupon in my Dangdang account immediately! ! ! Who needs your broken gift certificate! ! Didn’t you explicitly tell you not to put this gift certificate in my account? I received your apology call the other day and I stopped mentioning it. Do not cancel this coupon, I will continue to ""write a review""! ! ! Why are you so annoying! ! ! KF051501056101361930 "
0	It’s a bit heavy, but at this price, there are only 2 USB ports and the location is not appropriate 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, and it feels like a paradise. It is especially recommended to go to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum next door before 7 am (because the 70 yuan ticket is free). The air quality and surrounding environment are much better than the Zhongshan Mausoleum the day before yesterday. I booked it at that time because the hotel was a four-star hotel and the price was not high. I thought it was a bargain. I didn’t expect that after I went there, the room smelled weird. Understand why not finish the project before the National Day. The room hardware, service and breakfast are at most three-star standards. It is recommended that you do not have higher expectations, otherwise you will be a little disappointed. 
0	"The location of the hotel is at a traffic crossroad, and the waiter doesn't know anything about it! The hotel was originally called Huaxia Hotel. It is estimated that in order to attract customers, the foreign name became ""Leimengde..."", so there is no need to stay in this hotel! "
1	Recommended book: People who find love, those who are new to love, those who are in love, those who are frustrated in love, and those who are trapped by love can read it, and they can find that there are some you can’t even tell about yourself. But the feeling that I deeply feel Nalan has already explained for you. A good book that anyone who loves can't miss. I read it and memorized several songs. 
0	Because the client is in a building next to him, he lives nearby, but this place seems to be only such a bigger hotel, my colleague said it seems to be run by a Japanese 
0	Hey, it’s almost enough to read it again, whoever wants to transfer it to someone, even from Wuhan, if you need it, contact me qq42950063 
0	The hotel service is okay, but the facilities are a bit old, the toilet is broken (it should be a problem with the automatic water supply device), after each flushing, the water still flows continuously, in order to save water (water is precious and cannot be wasted), I turned off the water valve behind the toilet. I was planning to stay for two days, but the hotel facilities were too poor, so I went to Yiwu after staying for one day and stayed in Yiwu for two days. This hotel is more expensive than the Holiday Star Chain Hotel in Yiwu, but the facilities are not as good as those of Holiday Star. 
1	There is a parking lot, the room is clean, quiet, and not bad in all respects, but the price is still a bit higher in Zhaoqing. Last time we had an event in Zhaoqing Huangchao, the room facilities were at least one level higher than Xinghu Hotel for only 260 yuan. 
0	The main reason for buying it is firstly because of the popularity of this book, which makes people a little curious; secondly, because the acupoint map is attached, the wife wants it. There is not much hope of being honest about the content of the book. When I bought it, there was a Bodhisattva printed in the center of the cover. The content was the same as expected, and the text was mysterious. It felt like reading the martial arts secrets. If Chinese medicine continues to do this, it really kills itself. 
1	Advantages: 1 The room is large and very clean. 2 The location is good and it is very convenient to go there. 3 Good service attitude. Disadvantages: Not yet discovered. 
1	Don't worry about things from big factories, and the price/performance ratio is okay. Industrial design is not as good as Sony, but it is also good. 
1	Good luck. The price suddenly dropped at 10 pm. Ha ha. Grab one. In terms of function. Enough. In fact, the core technology of other brand netbooks is similar. The mold is different. There is no Bluetooth. The description does not match. Others are okay. The small table is good. Very convenient. 
0	The environment and facilities are not good, the rooms that were booked in advance that do not rely on the tracks were not reserved, and the sound of the train whistle all night affected sleep 
0	"""What a clever'Little Nizi'"" Dude! Why did you set a trap yourself without putting any bait? Others sneered and sneered. In the end, did you step in? ? ""My body is gray...your bright red and white."" En En En, yes yes, Confucius is gray, and you are bright. ""In the eyes of you beauties, what does Confucius look like?"" Oh, what a benevolence in the hearts of beauties! It is no wonder that Yi Lao reminds everyone in front of the book that this book ""cannot be read with a human heart, but a woman's heart!"". "
1	1 Brand advantages, meticulous workmanship 2 Good CPU heat dissipation, low sound 3 Both USB ports, reasonable design 4 Keyboard more comfortable 5 Comes with 1G memory, good after-sales, help me install the memory stick, use the VISTA system quickly after installation A lot 
1	The appearance is good, the hard disk is 320G, with the Vista home regular version, which is different from what Jingdong describes, and it is excellent value for money. 
0	The book I received seems to be a pirated copy. I only turned a few pages and found several typos and printing errors. Depressed! 
1	The courtyard environment is very good, the rooms are okay, some of the facilities are outdated, the service of a lady at the reception desk is a bit poor, but overall it is ok. 
1	In the development zone, the location is good and easy to find. Compared with the five-star hotel in the urban area, the hardware is slightly worse, but it is still clean and comfortable. Considering the price is cheaper than the urban area, the price/performance ratio is not bad. There are shopping malls and dining streets nearby, which are very convenient for shopping and eating. 
0	System upgrade is troublesome! I was delayed for a few days, and I called customer service twice, and the answers were different. I was a little dizzy. Isn't it from the same company? 
0	"It is arranged near the elevator. Extremely noisy! The elephant lives in the airport. Additional comments June 19, 2008: Breakfast was good. If you use Ctrip's reservation, you can't use the ""You Yue"" card for points. "
0	A good hotel in Lin'an, clean. The disadvantages are: 1 The sound insulation of the windows is not good, and the sound of cars outside can be heard very early. 2 TV channels are too few, Lin'an already has digital cable TV, but I don’t know why the hotel hasn’t. 3 No free drinking water is provided. 4 The front desk staff is not professional, enthusiastic and polite. 
0	To be honest, this is the worst book I bought in Dangdang. I thought it was a theoretical one. I didn’t expect the author to talk endlessly about his grievances with a few people. It feels like Lu Xun’s sister-in-law Xianglin. It's boring. The author also said that he is the big boss. I think he has to make a big question. The big boss needs to hype the book like this? Need to work hard to get these manuscript fees? ! 
1	"This book comprehensively introduced me to Maritan's thoughts. In fact, it is not only the thought of this neo-Thomasist philosopher, but also the inheritance and development of the entire tradition and classical thought. On this basis, this book is worth reading, and must be read carefully, because it is very comprehensive. Therefore, in my humble opinion, this book can be read more appropriately as an ""aperitif"" or a ""dessert"" for traditional western philosophy. I wish you all who love the wise can get real enjoyment from reading. "
0	<<Lust Caution>> The novel is not good, and I will never read it again~~ This book also relies on Lust Caution as a selling point. Other novels and articles are from Zhang's other books. ~~ 
0	If you want to stay in, please keep the following points in mind. I suggest not to stay. There are many options through Ctrip. 1. The TV has to complain about the Jinyuan Hotel 1. I booked the Jinyuan Hotel for two nights from 12/26-12/28 The reservation requires three rooms on the same floor. But one room is in Block A ($450). The other two are in Block B ($330). I heard the front desk work 
0	The sound of the hard disk is too loud, and it is similar to the sound read in the old CD-ROM drive. At first I thought it was a computer problem. After checking it, many people said that this is a common problem of the entire book. Configured 
1	However, it is best to install the Vista system. I have installed two different ghostXPs and there are some minor problems. It is best to install Vista only. I haven’t found anything wrong. 
1	"Our company does CD copying and processing. So there is a great need for the contact information of audiovisual electronic publishing houses. I bought two copies of the ""2005 China Audiovisual and Electronic Publishers Directory"" and successively contacted dozens of publishing houses, some of which were suspended. Because this book is the 2005 edition, the update aspect may need to be strengthened. However, it is still helpful for business. Even if there is no obvious and intuitive benefit. But at least through telephone, email, fax, etc., let more publishers know our company and know that there is a very professional CD manufacturer in Guilin. "
0	Before I bought it, I saw a lot of people saying that installing the system was troublesome, but it was not only a little annoying, the hard drive was not found at first. . . After searching for a long time, the biggest problem is installing the driver. The driver of this sound card is really annoying and there are many unknown devices. 
0	There is absolutely no four-star hotel in this hotel, and the soundproofing of the rooms is too poor. The noise of cars on the road and the messy noises upstairs made me stay up all night. I strongly recommend that Ctrip cancel this one. The lobby restaurant is contracted. Personally, so the buffet breakfast can only be served in the lobby cafe, the facilities are not perfect, and the variety is few. It is strongly recommended that Ctrip cancel the recommendation of this hotel. 
0	The room facilities are far below the four-star level, which is barely three-star. 
1	I'm still a college student. Although I don't have a complete concept of some of the terms in the book, I still have a deep feeling after reading it, even enthusiastic. As a post-80s generation, they are always called arrogant and arrogant. I think that when we read this book, the post-80s generation will find that life in the future is actually very difficult. I think many of the rules of life mentioned in the book are not only The same applies to many state-owned enterprises for foreign companies. Thanks to the author for allowing me to see this society more clearly. I will find a job next year. I plan to read this book several times and seriously consider my choices. 
0	I bought this book by accident. I bought it after reading a wonderful review. I was disappointed. Maybe it’s because of my age. This book should only be suitable for teenagers and twenties. It's boring to come. 
0	Ctrip members please note: There is noise and dust due to construction such as subways next to this hotel. There is still a period of time until completion. It is not convenient to call a taxi when you go out. Please consider these factors when you check in. Tea in the room is not free Yes, it is necessary to collect money, but also pay attention. 
1	"Orwell showed us the phenomenon of totalitarianism. Hayek, let us understand why totalitarianism inevitably leads to these phenomena. Originally, there was not much consideration for the system similarity of many totalitarian countries. It was more due to the lack of deepening of the concept of democracy, human greed, and some accidental factors. This book directly discusses the process by which the whole thought must lead to totalitarianism. After reading it, he shouted wildly, ""Oh my God, it turns out that this is a game."" Besides, the translation is really bad. Many sentences need to be read word by word. But the reward of reading patiently is definitely huge. "
1	"This is my first time buying a book through Dangdang.com. My friend said it was a good deal, so I tried it. Through this purchase of books, I feel that Dangdang is delivering books quickly, and it will arrive the next day. I compared the book with the book ""Walk Through Germany"" I bought in a bookstore, and found that it lacked the logo of Waiyanshe. I don't know if it is genuine. Looking at the content, the printing quality is pretty good, there should be no problem. I will use this textbook soon. If there is no problem, I will choose Dangdang to buy books in the future. The overall feeling is pretty good "
1	Generally speaking, I am satisfied. The hotel provides free pick-up. An accident occurred during the pick-up. The hotel's car was suspected of operating without a license, but the pick-up staff still took a taxi to take us to the hotel without delaying our trip. The rooms are also good, the place is very good, the back door is the bus to Mogao Grottoes and the railway station, usually every 30 minutes or longer. The hotel has its own travel agency. We chartered a car to Yadan and Yumenguan, etc. The service was good. 
0	My son likes it, we just watched I want to have a star, I want to see the sea and I want to have a younger brother, I have to read each book 3 times before I am willing to change it! 
0	The special room has no external windows; the sound insulation of the room and the room is too poor 
0	Interpreting history in a ridiculous way may earn applause from the big guys, but after a serious thought, it seems that there is not much left. The preface expert may not have read this book seriously. . . . The language in the book is not rigorous enough, and the logic is a bit confusing. . . . I can't read anymore, (two) (three) still lying on the side quietly. . . . (4) I'm afraid I won't buy it. . . . . . 
0	I placed an order with two other books, but this one was omitted without any explanation, and the invoice was only paid for two books. 
1	After hesitating for a long time, I finally decided to buy it. It looks pretty. The accompanying operating system is also beautiful. Overall feel good 
1	"Japan has always been an important town of Taoist research and has achieved very enviable results. The proofreading of ""Zhen Gu"" is one of them. ""Zhen Gu"" is an important work compiled by Tao Hongjing during the Liang Dynasty in the Southern Dynasties. It records the history of the early Shang Qing sect and is extremely useful for us to understand the emergence and development of early Taoism. However, its terminology is simple and ancient, and it is not easy to read. There are many allusions and it is difficult to study deeply. It has always been a very difficult book to read. The Japanese worked hard, exhausted ten years of skill and made a complete school note. Not only the text was reviewed and revised, but also the allusions and terminology were revised and interpreted, which made it convenient for us to read and use this book. "
1	"I just bought this book in Dangdang, but in fact I have read it in detail. I just bought it because I like it, so I want to own one. As a mother, I really feel that it is difficult to educate children, and the author’s education methods are difficult to learn by myself, but there are also many touches. It's worth seeing! I watched Chi Li’s ""Holding Hands"" many years ago (because the TV series did not keep up, I missed the plot behind it), but at that time I liked Jiang Wenli’s performance better. I only discovered Chi Li’s writing style after watching ""Come on, Child"" well. So, now I am reading another book of hers-""So"". "
0	I bought it after seeing the rave reviews on the Internet, and I felt disappointed when the book arrived. Means nothing. The 2-and-a-half-year-old son didn't like it either. 
1	The appearance is good and unexpected. The standby time is normal, and the VISTA system is under trial, and the heat is a little bit high. 
0	Never want to live there anymore. 1. The transportation is inconvenient; 2. It is said to be a five-star, but it does not meet the five-star standard. The room is small, and it feels like home and fast, even not as fast as home; 3. Service attitude , The attitude of some people is really bad. The day I arrived happened to be 5.12. On the day of the Sichuan earthquake, I arrived at nearly 8 in the evening. Once there, the service staff said that they had not received the reservation. Many, most of the local people came here to hide, because this hotel is newly opened and the floor is not high, so there were no vacancies at that time), I heard it and asked them to confirm again, but their front desk staff was very absent I was patient and gave me a little temper. When I called Ctrip, there was a male waiter who was still laughing and happy. Later CTIRP confirmed with them that there is indeed this order, which is inside them. No handover. I will never go there again. Definitely not... 
1	The room has free broadband and the speed is very fast. The hotel is very close to the general's office. Those who want to visit and have a short time can choose here. 
0	Very ordinary hotel, close to the road, although it has double windows, it is a bit noisy. Usually the price should be less than 200 yuan, and the holiday price of 380 yuan is too high. Overall, it is very general, including service. 
1	"My child is 4 years old and 5 months old. I bought ""Maze"" 4 years old, 5 years old, 6 years old, because she likes to walk through mazes, and the main reason is that I don’t know if the content is suitable. I bought them all and read them. The quality is good, but I personally think that the 4-year-old is too simple. For such a small child, the topic that does not need to use brains will also feel dull. Maybe the 4-year-old refers to a 4-year-old child. I also bought the 5-year-old ""Maze"", which I think is right. He loves this 4-year-old book for a colleague’s child, a boy who is almost 4 years old. "
1	It was pretty good-looking. I originally bought it for my son, but then I couldn’t help but read it myself. The comics in the book are very funny, and there is a lot of knowledge. Adults and children can read it very well, but it’s a pity that such a good subject science Manga is indeed a work of South Korea. Why did the country give up the easy way of learning science and popularizing science? Choosing the toilet for reading place is really too busy for me. Time is occupied by other things. Only when I go to the toilet is my most relaxing time. I often see my feet numb before I get up. Hehe, laughed! 
0	It is better not to install anything with linux pre-installed. The MSI agent who went to Zhongguancun helped install the system and confiscated my money. The agent said that Jingdong’s purchase price was lower than the purchase price, and the intention was self-evident. 
1	The hotel is in a good location, but it is not convenient to take a taxi. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, it is quite affordable and delicious. Additional comment on January 3, 2008: The hotel’s service is warm and thoughtful. When checking in, because there is no room type booked by me, the hotel took the initiative to upgrade for free. The train station is within easy reach and there are many shops and restaurants around. It is very convenient. To Xuzhou business will stay again. 
0	The touchpad is a bit hot, I don't know if it is normal. The outer shell is all plastic, and it feels a bit not strong.I think I have to buy an inner tank. 
1	The appearance is good,,, the workmanship is good, the keyboard feels good, it should be Sony’s consistent style,,, 
1	I snapped it up at 3999, so lucky. What else is there for the price? The brand and price are very good 
0	The hotel is too old. I was shocked when I entered the room at noon. It was much better to enter the room at night. Because of the dim lighting. I stayed in a budget hotel for the first time and it felt bad. But the bed was quite clean. The shower water is also very large, and this price can only be used in this hotel in Beijing! 
1	The black appearance is quite simple, like the matte screen. The heat dissipation is okay. The sound is very small, even in the middle of the night, it is just a little bit of hard drive movement, compared with the desktop computer next to it, even perfect. The keyboard also works pretty smoothly. 
1	As a budget hotel chain, I think Jinjiang Inn is better than Jiajia and Motel. The most obvious is that the room itself is spacious enough, the toilet is not cramped, and the toilet is still lengthened. A breakfast of 10 yuan is rich. The color and tone of the entire hotel look comfortable, just like home. 
1	Small and light, you can’t check much when you put a book in your backpack. The white feels very clean and the internet speed is very fast. 
0	I bought this book for my nephew. I thought it would be a very thick book. At least the content is not that little and monotonous. When I received the goods, I opened it and I was disappointed. It was not worth it. Compared with the price, this book is too worthwhile. 
0	The buttons are not very comfortable, maybe because of their smallness. The touch screen is not very useful, but I usually use a mouse 
1	I started to read the serialized book on the Internet and thought it was good, so I decided to buy it and read it carefully. Get the new book, the book cover is dark red shading, hidden crisis warning. After reading it carefully, I feel that the characters in the book have distinct personalities and strong storytelling. Yes, yes, it is a rare good book. 
1	I borrowed it from the library before and looked at it once. After reading it, I felt bored for a long time. Later, when I heard that Xu Jinglei wanted to make it into a movie, I couldn't help but want to relive this sad solitary song again. I think the point of this book is not limited to letting the reader follow a swinger to recall his empty life. The author uses his superb expressive techniques to control this short story, entwining the reader’s heart step by step to feel an infatuation. The bumpy fate of women. Even the translation can be conveyed to me with such precision, let alone the original text. As for CDs, the power of writing is still strong. 
0	RedFlag changed to XP, especially the sound card needs to be installed with UUA. After the installation, the startup sound has broken sound, and then it is inexplicably better, but the touch screen fails, but then it is better, and it has been tossing for 2 days! Depressed, but overall, I like NE808PA! For my wife! 
1	The overall feeling of staying at the hotel on July 19 was better. The disadvantages are as follows: 1. The signs from Building 1 to Building 2 are not obvious, and they have to go a long way. 2. The service staff seem to have no idea what it means to meet and say hello. It's far worse than the Seaview Garden Hotel. I was in the hotel lobby, corridors, and yards and saw the service staff in various positions in the hotel. Most of them didn’t know that they should take the initiative to greet the guests. 
1	The hotel rooms are built around the pond, and the goldfish in the pond add a bit of fun. The main guest room can be separated by the pond by the restaurant, which is quiet and elegant. There are two parking lots at the front and rear, which are quite convenient for pick-up and drop-off. Shortcomings, some electrical appliances in the special room are older. 
1	I have learned several chapters, and I feel pretty good, and my toughness has improved significantly. But there is a feeling that breathing is difficult to master. I am still a beginner. Maybe I should go to the gym and follow the yoga teacher to learn how to adjust breathing when doing certain movements. Anyway, I like this book very much. Perseverance is the most important thing. Suggestions to netizens who want to buy this book. This book is quite comprehensive. If you don’t just want to lose weight in a short period of time, just read this book. You don’t need to buy other books. Yoga is now available on the market. There are too many books, and many of them are taken out of them to make up the pages. 
1	5. Thank the author for giving us such a wonderful gift. 
1	The location is quite far away, it takes a long time to get to the city. The breakfast is average and the room to choose is small. The room is good and big, and I feel very comfortable 
0	I'm sure I won't live here again, it's too old, the musty smell is too strong, it doesn't feel good! 
1	High cost performance, good appearance, stable performance, low noise, good support for mobile hard drives, the driver and instructions for use are placed in the E drive. The battery has an extended warranty card. 
1	The led screen is good, no dead pixels; the keyboard is comfortable; the CD in the XP machine is driven; Jingdong delivery is fast 
0	I originally planned to stay here for 2 days, but due to the extremely poor network, my online meetings were interrupted several times, which seriously affected my work, so I left in a hurry. The image of the guest room is very vague, and only an amateur IT makes me impressed! The decoration of the lobby is not bad, and the waiters are more enthusiastic. For those users who require high-quality internet, staying is not recommended. 
1	Good quality and cheap! The first time I bought something on JD.com, the service and delivery speed are all good. The point is that the things are good. I work at a notebook foundry. I can see that it is genuine! ! 
1	Very average, the rooms are small, and the furniture is outdated and old. The price-performance ratio is too bad, book one night, and then renew another night. Really dissatisfied and changed to InterContinental Hotel two days later. I will renew one day later, but it is not counted as booking through the city! It may be driven by interests. In contrast, I also set a day before renewing InterContinental. Intercontinental handled it very well. Additional comments May 20, 2008: Also, I booked a double room through Xiecheng, which became a standard room. Very unpleasant! 
1	At the beginning, I read Dangdang’s recommendations and said that the different Carmela book is a five-star Amazon book, and everyone’s reviews are also very good. Because my son is very active and rarely sits and reads quietly, I bought a set with a skeptical attitude. However, what surprised me was that after I bought this set of books, my son was completely fascinated. After returning from kindergarten, he would listen to Carmela’s story every night and he would come from the heart when he saw interesting places. Laughing, thank Dangdang for his recommendation. Such a good set of books made my son fall in love with reading. 
1	Home Inn has a consistent style, and the rooms are the same. In other words, Home Inn’s prices are relatively real. If you live in Shanghai, it’s clean and the price is favorable. . . 
1	Affected by the idea of light management in reconstruction, the research on water conservancy project management is very weak, and there are even fewer books involving project management, especially river management. Professor Zheng has been engaged in river management for a long time and has very rich management experience and theoretical accomplishments. The book systematically expounds the basic theory of river courses, advanced management models and development directions at home and abroad, sorts out the status quo of river management and laws and regulations in my country, raises questions and measures, and proposes specific methods for administrative licensing of river projects and specific river management. And guidance, new concept, strong practicability, and very valuable! Jiangsu Water Resources Liu 
0	This hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room facilities are outdated, with a musty smell, and the sheets and bedding are sticky. The most annoying thing is that the waiter will definitely frame the guests. I stayed there for 4 days. At the checkout on July 20, the front desk said that the room attendant checked and found that a paid towel was opened. I travel a lot and have stayed in countless hotels. This is the first time I have encountered this kind of thing. I stayed in a hotel and never moved those paid supplies and rooms I live alone and there are no visitors in the meantime. Who would open the torn towel and open a small mouth without using it, but the hotel attendant insisted that I opened it. The hardware facilities of a hotel are almost nothing, and the quality of service is almost impassive. Originally, but the waiters are dishonest, and even stolen customers are fundamentally problematic. I advise you not to stay in this hotel. 
0	I bought it when I saw that the evaluation was so high, but my daughter didn't like it. I looked at it and didn't like it either. I don't know what it is. The cars are all outdated or not in life. I don't understand why there is such a high evaluation. 
0	The environment is average, after living, people feel that the price and service are out of proportion! 
1	The battery life is what I like, and the configuration is the strongest among all netbooks. Jingdong’s prices are fair, ha ha. 
0	The hotel is too dirty, too old and too broken! The toilet in the room is smelly from the drain! The carpet is old and can't see the color. The TV has only 6 channels! I'm so dizzy! The front desk staff are all sitting and looking at the newspaper and working, and there is only one waiter at the front desk. The room attendant opened the door without knocking. I can't stand it! ! 
0	I watched TV while reading, and cried several times. I bought a novel this time because I wanted to absorb some survival power from it. I cried with a smile. The author’s expression of this kind of expression makes people feel even more grief. People feel that they have no reason not to live well. 
0	The heat dissipation is not good. Jingdong’s packaging is really bad. A large box contains a few pieces of foam, and it has not been tightly sealed. This is very dangerous. The system Jingdong should not be stingy with those pieces of foam. 
1	The price-performance ratio is good, the appearance of the notebook is very beautiful, I heard that it has been discontinued, and the replacement of the XP system is also very smooth, but the SM bus driver is attached to the graphics card driver, so be careful. 
0	It’s the first time I didn’t have a promotion, but I had to buy the package myself, but I forgot to buy it, but I only bought it the second time. 
1	You can install xp, but the attached driver disk is vista, you have to download xp driver from ASUS official website. The mouse was given inside, so I bought another one. 
1	Lightweight, long battery life, and good speed, depending on the h264 and 720p video quality with a bit rate below 5M. Other features are good. 
0	To be honest, 180 is too wasteful, and the annex building is not worth even 120.This is the hotel I regret most. 
1	I am not accustomed to LINUX system. I just have an external CD-ROM drive. Reinstalling XP is quick and easy. The speed is super fast. When browsing the web and watching PPS, it is clear and smooth. It is connected to a large-screen display. 
0	Apart from the location close to the subway, few other advantages have been found. The room smells bad and the bathroom has stains. The most unbearable thing is the phone and the Internet: the phone is a weird busy tone when you pick it up, you have to dial seven or eight times in a row to get through once, I asked the front desk, and answered that there is indeed a problem of poor contact. Just bear it! I told the front desk in person that I want to open the network (although the charge is 20 yuan/day). The answer is: No problem, this is activated, and the IP address is automatically assigned, without manual setting. After returning to the room, I found that there was no local connection. After contacting the front desk, there was a local connection. But I can’t open the webpage after trying for a long time, and then contact the front desk (it’s almost collapsed!), the waiter came over ten minutes later and randomly pointed me to delete the company’s IP address (just a backup setting, not the default connection, there is no need to delete it) , And then changed the automatically obtained IP of the default connection to their manual address. Completely fainted,,,,,,,, I will never dare to stay in such a hotel anymore, please also Ctrip to be more responsible for users! 
0	Thermal design problem-overheating on the left side of the keyboard. The xp driver is too confusing, and the graphics card is not easy to install. The machine is thinner-not too strong. 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
0	When we went to Yancheng, the lowest temperature was only 4 degrees. It was so cold at night that the air conditioner was not turned on. I complained to the hotel room department and the answer was that there is no instruction from the leader to turn on the heating. If it is too cold, you can give it more. A quilt is too pitiful. . . 
1	I chose this hotel based on everyone's comments, and the overall feeling is still very good. The Deluxe A booked this time will be upgraded to an executive room for free because there is no room. The rooms are relatively spacious, clean and tidy, soundproofed, and the service is very warm: paper cranes, small notes, refreshing mung bean soup and fruits. The little details reflect the service of a four-star hotel. satisfaction. Let me talk about a little episode. At the front desk, the waiter checked the reservation status and recommended me to upgrade. I declined their offer. Then I said that I booked a twin room, and I said I want a double room (it seems that you can’t choose a double bed or a twin bed when booking), and then I called to ask if there is a deluxe double room. After listening to them, they said yes. I said no for a while, making me confused, and finally told me: There is no room now, because this is the hotel, so I have a free upgrade. Although this episode is a bit unpleasant, it is more satisfying to solve the problem based on the principle that the customer is God. Will choose here in the future. Hotel Feedback August 13, 2008: Thank you for choosing the Ambassador Hotel to stay and recognize the hotel. Looking at your comments, guess that you may have booked the room directly through the Internet? There is no option for special room requirements (such as special requirements such as large beds) for direct booking through the Internet. If the reservation has special requirements for the room, it is recommended that you call the reservation. The hotel and Ctrip reservation staff will make a record together and prepare the room in advance according to your requirements. Ctrip reservation telephone: 800-820-6666, 400-820-6666 (mobile phone); hotel reservation telephone: 0311-86911999. Thank you again for your review! I wish you a good mood and all the best. 
1	Beautiful, small, exquisite, suitable for girls, very gorgeous and noble, running vista is not slow, no highlights, good luck 
1	First of all, from the appearance point of view, this notebook uses piano paint, which is particularly stylish and beautiful; the innovative keyboard design is quite touching and feels good. Secondly, from the configuration point of view, it is relatively balanced, and according to the evaluation, the graphics card is more capable than 105GM; the LED screen feels more comfortable than TFT, and the 2 million camera is also practical. Finally, this is a business notebook, which is more stable than home notebooks. It is beyond doubt; the commendable thing is that the heat dissipation is excellent, and I am very satisfied! 
0	The content is empty, and everyone knows the truth. It's not worth buying, you can go to the bookstore if you have nothing to do, don't waste the money 
1	As a 4 star hotel, although the decoration is relatively outdated, it is OK. The rooms are well equipped. The transportation is mainly taxi. It's convenient to get to the railway station at 7 yuan and Guancheng at 10 yuan. The restaurant’s service attitude was good. We came back late and the restaurant was about to close, but we still fried fish roe. For a business of only 14 yuan, we waited for a long time. I don't dare to compliment the service at the front desk, and passengers who dislike using credit cards very much. Ask me to pay cash and inform that the credit card authorization cannot be cancelled. Forced to be helpless, I showed her the wallet, which was only 130 yuan. The check-in staff at the front desk asked me to give her 100 yuan in cash, so I didn't think I was going out to have a supper or take a taxi? After my repeated insistence, the credit card authorization was used. In fact, the use of authorization, and subsequent cancellation of authorization and checkout are very fast, without the slightest trouble. But I don't understand why she didn't let me use a credit card. It took several minutes for this matter. We have repeatedly asked us to add 10 yuan to the booked room rate to make any phone calls. Are we visiting Jiayuguan just to talk on the phone in the hotel? I didn't agree. I told him that I wanted to pay the predetermined price. She said that there would be no room, but I said that if you don't arrange for me, I will complain to Ctrip. As soon as I heard this, the house was there again. 
1	Lived once many years ago. This is the second time to live. The room is large and clean. Because the reason in front of the hotel is better, it is also a lot more convenient. The food street on Li Nanbin Road is not far from the hotel. The hotel's breakfast is really good, and it is not inferior to many higher-end hotels. But for so many years, the appearance of the hotel is too old, and the lobby does not have the style of a four-star hotel. 
0	"I have stayed at this hotel four times in a month, and I know these people at the front desk, but every time I check in, both men and women at the front desk keep their heads down and cold, and they don’t even say hello. I don’t know what they are doing. This is the only 4-star hotel I have ever seen. After the checkout, I only said that it was OK, and never said that it was welcome next time. I used to observe for 10 minutes. During this period, the last words of several people who checked out were ""It's okay"", and most of them didn't look at the customers, just sorted their things. In addition, the room is too dim and depressing. "
1	It was the first time I booked a room with Ctrip. I lived in Chang'an Hotel very comfortably and the dining was very satisfying. The price is only not much lower than the front desk price, not too competitive. 
0	Books are not blogs. If I want to read blogs, I don’t have to buy books. I don’t have any concept of writing books. I just moved my blog. 
0	"This year’s 5.1 and 10.1 long holidays have set Home Inns in Xi’an and Chongqing respectively. I am very disappointed. Home Inns has no integrity at all. Here is a brief description of my experience, hoping to provide reference for friends traveling. 5.1 The Home Inn in Xi'an was seriously overbooked. Our 11 people almost slept on the street and negotiated with the hotel for 2 hours. Only 3 of the 4 rooms originally scheduled were obtained. At the same time, many guests who arrived at the hotel had to leave with their luggage because there was no room to live in. On September 14th, through Ctrip, Ctrip booked a 10.5-day home-like Shangqing Temple store, learned 5.1 lessons, used a credit card to guarantee payment on the afternoon of 10.5, arrived at the hotel, processed credit card pre-authorization, and signed several check-in forms inexplicably (In the case that the hotel is determined to sign), when I got the room card, I discovered that the originally scheduled 2 sets of business double rooms were replaced by standard rooms and double rooms. The hotel only said ""Sorry, the room is full"". There is no explanation. There are no high requirements on the size and facilities of the room. After all, it is a budget hotel. The most unbearable thing is that one of the rooms smelled so bad that the waiter did it three times, but it still smelled. Speechless... "
0	"I bought a copy of ""Du Lala's Promotion"" on Dangdang.com. On page 51, the fifth line from the bottom read: ""Left is just a temporary agent..."". Should it be: ""It's just a temporary agent""? Please forgive me for my shallow knowledge. If my understanding is wrong, please forgive me. If there is a typo, is it a problem with the original book? "
0	Format linux, but can't delete it, always run grub command, it's dead. It doesn't work, and I didn't install windows xp. After I came back and gave it to others all night, I still didn't install it. I don't know which master can teach me. 
1	I didn't expect this place in Kaifeng to have a hotel with such a good service. The training of hotel staff is in place. The service is about the same as some five-star hotels I have experienced. It turned out to be the team of the Municipal Party Committee Guest House. The downside is which room we stayed in, the facilities are a bit outdated. The traffic is very convenient. It takes 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the most prosperous Kaifeng snack street. 
0	The screen resolution is a bit small, especially the 1024*600 600, it will be inconvenient to use for a while. In addition, as many people commented, if you run a little more things, it will get stuck. 
0	I bought back this bestseller with joy, but before I finished reading it, the back cover of the book almost fell off. Based on my many years of experience in buying books, from the perspective of the paper, printing quality, packaging and content of the book, there are reasons to believe that I bought a photocopy. 
0	"The book ""Seeking a doctor is worse than seeking self"" is very practical. I have recommended it to many friends. Look at my order. Several of these books were bought for or for friends. My friends said I was They have become ""big fools"". In fact, it’s not that I can fool you, it’s that the book is really good. In terms of marketing, selling good new products is called marketing. Selling bad products is called cheating. I introduce good products to my friends. Obviously, benefit should not be included in fraudulent sales. "
1	The room is clean and comfortable, and the air flow is good. No bad smell...Because it is in the downtown area, the traffic is more convenient, but it is also a bit noisy... 
0	After watching it for a little while, I felt that there was no inspiration, so I gave up. ps: Yu Dan is so famous, it may also be my poor understanding:-) 
1	The first time I booked a hotel online, the price is 428 yuan, I feel that the room is relatively poor. I used to book a room under the name of a friend’s company every time I came to Uzbekistan. The price was very favorable. This time I booked it by myself. For a room of 428 yuan, only 320 yuan is enough... 
1	I have been using it for two days and haven't found any problems. The price/performance ratio of this machine is quite high. 
0	I got the urge to buy this book only after reading the propaganda in the newspaper. Later I searched the Internet and found it was not expensive, so I bought it. I took a short time to look at it, and I thought it was so-so. Value for money, 
0	The price cut is too fast! I just bought it for a week and lost 200 yuan, and I got an extra mouse! What a bad luck! 
0	HP's cost-saving price is: pre-installed Little Red Riding Hood (it is more troublesome to modify WIN), no hard drive indicator, no power indicator, and the fan also runs in a regular cycle. The heat dissipation is not as exaggerated as imagined, it can be tolerated~ 
0	The system crashed too much, 220g c drive, vista is not easy to use, it is troublesome to reinstall xp and install the driver 
0	After taking a taxi to the hotel, I found that the facade was very small and poor, very inconspicuous. I went to the front desk to go through the procedures and found that the attitude was very poor, and there was a sign of service pacemaker, I didn't feel it at all. The room is also very average. At noon the next day, because it was a 4:30 p.m. plane, I discussed whether I could delay the check-out time by about 20 minutes. The answer was that one minute would not work. If it takes more than one minute, even half a day, the tone is still very unfriendly! 
0	The sound of the CD-ROM drive reading disk is a bit abnormal, and the disk cannot be read when the system is installed. It took several hours to get it done 
1	I ordered it for a friend, and the price is relatively affordable in Shanghai. But my friends didn’t say it was very good or dissatisfied after staying, ha ha! 
0	As soon as I saw the beginning, I couldn't stand it anymore. Her narrative style made me feel like a junior high school student. I just flipped through it and threw it aside. 
1	The original is very unaccustomed to using VISTA! Take it home and reinstall XP directly! The driver under the official website is not an integrated package! It’s a little troublesome to download one by one! The machine is still very cost-effective! The price of this configuration is pretty good! This time the gift is very practical, the cooling pad + kill soft, I think it is very worthwhile~! 
0	"I have stayed at this hotel during the National Day, my evaluation is ""poor, it is actually too bad"". First: the towels are not only old, but broken, there are holes. The second bath faucet has little water, so small. The third room is noisy, and the KTV on the third floor is noisy until 12 o'clock in the evening. Fourth: There is almost nothing to eat for breakfast. The fifth checkout round was too slow. We waited for more than half an hour. There are many, many differences. It can be said to be inferior to our two-star hotels in Ningbo. Additional comments on October 8, 2007: For such a hotel Ctrip, the standard room cost 420 yuan per room. Order directly by yourself for 580 yuan a room. Not worth it! ! "
1	Compared with the above configuration, a very low-priced notebook. Putting a universal keyboard film is very suitable, and it is not afraid of dust. 
0	The camera is not clear, the heat dissipation is average, it is said that it is a business type, and the heat dissipation is not very good! The brightness of the ASUS screen is not good, the sound is small, and the sound quality is stronger than before. The original sound quality is really rubbish. 
1	The hotel’s transportation is not very convenient. It is far from the city. The train station is about RMB 17,8. Because it is located in the development zone, most of the people who live here come to work with various companies in the development zone, especially Chery’s suppliers. Mostly with customers. To be honest, there are some unexpected surprises. I didn't expect Wuhu to have such a cost-effective hotel. I live in an executive standard room. The room is very large. In addition to two beds, there is also a very good desk. The bathroom is dry and wet. The shower room and bathtub are for guests to take their needs. The amount of water is also sufficient. Shampoo is used. And bath lotion is not a crappy product used by most hotels, it is two large cans of household products; you can either boil water or drink the direct drinking water provided by the hotel. The service is also very good, check in and check out are very fast, all the staff who meet you will politely say hello! The doorman was very polite. There was no car at the door when he left the hotel. A doorman walked out close to one mile under the scorching sun to help me stop the car in on another road. He was really embarrassed. The room delivery speed is also very fast, and the dishes are full and delicious. In addition to ordering the room delivery menu, they can also let them choose from the Chinese food menu. The only downside may be their breakfast buffet. There was really nothing to eat, and I was late and almost all bottomed out. The waiters are not very active in adding dishes, even if they add a little bit, one person will finish it. I don’t know if it’s because the buffet breakfast is afraid that the guests will eat too much... In general, the environment and service are still good. If you have the opportunity to go again, you will still live there. 
0	I originally wanted to buy it back for a good friend, but when I opened it, the content was too simple. I just drew some cars, small animals, and so on, and I returned the goods. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, there is an urge to buy. But I still didn't buy it. The screen is too small for my nearsighted people. I bought it for a friend. 
0	"If you are under 18, I suggest you try this book that is liked by some people. I bought it and browsed a page or two and never wanted to look at it again! Tell me about the content of the book. In other words, you can find clues about this book if you find a book stand in the night market and open a book about ""Secrets of Success"" or ""The Art of Interpersonal Relations"". . . In other words, this book is no different from all kinds of popular inspirational books on the market! It is nothing more than dogmatic preaching. For a mature man, these things are completely... "

0	There is no special content, it is the same as other books of the same kind, and they are all common sense. I read it in half an hour, and the content in the visible period is very empty 
0	If you want to stay up all night without sleeping and thinking about things, I highly recommend staying in this hotel. It is also a hotel on the elevated side. Other hotels use sound-proof glass, but Shaanxi Building does not use it. In the dead of night, you can hear the rolling traffic on the elevated!

1	The facilities inside are not bad, and the location is OK. Will consider staying next time. However, the user-friendly settings should be improved. Hotel Feedback July 10, 2008: Thank you for staying at Century Hotel and for your valuable suggestions for improvement. In the future service, we will continue to improve, and at the same time, improve and improve according to the humanized suggestions that each customer gives us. Hebei Century Hotel will provide you with more meticulous service in line with the principle of all for the sake of guests! 
0	I regret that. I bought this book after receiving a recommendation email from Dangdang.com. Unexpectedly, it was full of advertisements and the author's self-promotion. I regret that I did not see the real experience of the author that I was expecting, and I also regret that Dangdang, which I admire, will bring such books to readers as recommendations. 
1	"What impressed me most was the two passages: ""A country where the prime minister flew to the disaster area within two hours, a country that can dispatch 100,000 rescuers, a country where corporate and private donations have reached billions, and a country that is competing for blood donation Countries that voluntarily rescue the wounded and cause traffic jams will never be defeated!"" Wen Jiabao: ""I just said that the people are supporting you, and you can figure it out."" Even today, nearly a year after the disaster, reading these words still touches people's hearts, because these are the voices of the heart. "
1	When I chose this book, I paid too much attention. In the end, all other brands were eliminated. Only R400 and ASUS’s N80 tassel series were left. Then I heard from my company colleagues that ASUS is really not good. Think about it and forget it. After I chose R400, I saw parallel imports. The T400. In terms of quality, there is not much difference, but the R400 is a bit thicker. I don’t like parallel imports and it happened to catch up with the event when I bought it on May 12. Cheaper than 200. 
0	The instructions are too simple. Some software that comes with the installation does not have any instructions. I hope that the service can be more detailed in the future. 
1	Relatively high cost performance, environmental services are good. The buffet at 68 is also good, each person gives a cash voucher of 10 yuan, 58/person. I just don’t know if there is a parking lot, the parking spaces at the entrance of the lobby are very limited. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you for choosing the Ambassador Hotel to stay, and approve the hotel. There is a special parking lot on the first floor of the hotel. The front, backyard and the first parking lot can be used for parking. welcome next time! I wish a happy life and smooth work! 
1	It’s a bit bigger, more suitable for men of mighty men. The red touch multimedia keys look very beautiful. I don’t feel any obvious heat after installing a lot of things, which is not bad. 
0	"This time I stayed with my husband in this hotel for a single night price of 640 yuan in a deluxe room, a double room. I was very dissatisfied. First of all, after I arrived at the hotel at night, I found out that the so-called double room was originally a family room with a large bed and a small bed in a very small room! Later, I made an opinion. The hotel said it was a problem with Ctrip. I called Ctrip and said that there was no way to change rooms. I was in a very bad mood that night! ! The next morning, I wanted to go to Zhapo, because the introduction of Ctrip Hotel said ""Nearby Landscape: Zhapo Tourist Area"". . . . nearby? ? ? We spent 180 yuan on the bus for more than an hour to reach Zhapo! ! ! The hotel service is very bad, and I am very impatient with the attitude towards individual guests especially! The only bright spot is that a manager surnamed Liang offered us a car to Zhapo (at least 200 by taxi). And the attitude is very sincere. In short, if you want to travel to Zhapo, you must not go to this hotel, and would rather go to a cheaper Zhapo local hotel (there is no five-star hotel in the area). Hope our lessons can help you a little! "
1	It is very convenient to choose to stay for shopping. The hotel is connected to Harbour City, but the rooms are average, the facilities are very old, and the breakfast is also very average. I personally think that the best hotel breakfast in Hong Kong is the Le Méridien Cyberport. 
1	The price is cheap enough, the function is complete, the appearance is not bad, the price of the netbook is very good to buy such a notebook 
1	"Snow once said: ""In the deep mountains of southern China, there are two small towns that resemble a paradise, one is Phoenix in Hunan, and the other is Enshi in Hubei."" (Generally, the original words are not clear. Find the original). I am a ""Bizika"" man who grew up in the mountains, and my hometown is one of the cities. I used to like Snow's work and I went to Ningxia and other places to explore his footprints. Now I like Snow even more, because he is an international celebrity, and international celebrities have praised my poor hometown that others have never praised. "
1	The books are of good quality and trustworthy; in addition, Jingdong's service is indeed fast and the service attitude is also very good. give it a like! ! ! ! 
1	The room is very clean! The breakfast is great! The doorman is great! This is the second time I booked it. Will live in the future. 
0	"Professor Yu Dan's teaching of ""The Analects"" cannot accurately reflect the original Confucian thoughts. Apart from the fact that her teaching ""The Analects"" is not good, she can do everything else. "
1	The configuration is quite high, quite professional entertainment book, especially the rotating screen and touch are refreshing. There is also a titanium case and keyboard! It is difficult to break through the domestic quality! 
1	The facilities in the room are not bad, but the shower head in the bathroom is not easy to use, the water volume is not adjustable, the water is scattered, and some are not like the four-star standard. The surrounding environment, especially the environment behind the hotel, is not so good, and the lobby is too small. 
1	Awesome! Although the window is facing Central, it doesn't feel noisy at all. The rooms are very clean and tidy, giving people a very comfortable feeling, the service is also very good, the price is not expensive, very satisfied! 
0	The appearance is beautiful, the function indicators are also very good-looking, and the price is more cost-effective than Zhongguancun. It is more suitable for girls, watching movies and listening to music sound effects 
0	The overall feeling is not as good as IdeaPad's books. The USB setting is unreasonable. The optical drive and power supply are on one side, so it is inconvenient to open the optical drive. 
1	A very good book, through the author's personal experience, tell us the inside story of MLM, and benefit a lot! I remember that more than ten years ago, people around me participated in MLM, but they also actively encouraged me to do it, but my attitude is quite clear, that is, don't do it! I think you must be principled. It is recommended that everyone share it with each other to understand what MLM is? How harmful is MLM? There are some things that we can experience personally, but there are also some things that we absolutely cannot touch in our lifetime, such as drugs, pyramid schemes, etc. It is worth more than ten dollars to understand one thing! 
1	1. The appearance is fashionable and exquisite; 2. The display screen can be rotated and handwritten, which feels cool; 3. The mini remote control is easy to operate; 4. The configuration can meet the needs of office and entertainment, and the function is relatively powerful. 
1	I stayed at Seaview Jiafu after reading the reviews, and I feel not as good as Excelsior. The service is not good. Poor ventilation and smell in the room. I didn't see any fruit or chocolates. The overall feeling is similar to four-star. 
1	Find your place, satisfy what you have, and treat everyone well. Living a good life is not about material things, but about love. Love is always unforgettable. Reading a book will follow Dewey’s behavior, laughing will follow Dewey A very ordinary kitten, but it makes people feel moved. The hardest thing to do is the little bit of life and persistence. That’s why the love trickles like a stream into the heart. It’s easy to do. The hardest thing to persist in doing very simple things is difficult to do forever, so you should quietly taste this book 
1	Xianyi’s previous hatred, such speculation made him uneasy, perhaps compared to Xianyi’s revenge, this kind of anxiety is more tormenting, so I believe that for Xianyi’s revenge, although he is sad and sad, he should feel relieved. He can finally be clear. Feeling the hatred of Xieyi for him, feeling the pain that Xieyi once suffered, and the wound is opened, will the day of recovery be far behind? I think the same is true for freehand brushwork. All the hate is emptied, and the rest should be love. The love for Ayan who has been chasing in the past, and the love for Li Zeliang who is now nostalgic... 
0	The price is more expensive! The building is high, the lobby is relatively large, and the room is large enough. However, the hardware facilities are at the level of the late 1980s and early 1990s. They look old, the furniture is peeling, and the sanitary ware is the old generation of Kohler lined up, but it has no luster. The sink of the wash basin has a toothpaste cover in the sink. There is absolutely no four-star sanitary condition, and there is somebody's body hair on the newly changed sheets! The carpet in the elevator seems to be out of the original color, so don't even think about finding the spotless feeling in the room. The service was not four-star enough. The doorman watched me with my luggage indifferently and dragged my luggage away. It is estimated that he would not take the initiative to help if he was not called. The room service is not flattering. I only checked in at three o'clock in the middle of the night. As a result, the waiter knocked on the door after I fell asleep and gave me water and disposable supplies. Good spirit! But the time is not right. There is a broadband plug in the room, but I don’t know why. The location is not bad. I later figured it out. It is estimated that it was built by the oilmen and mainly used for public money consumption, so the price is expensive, the service is poor, and the hotel management is not emphasized. If you travel by yourself, live less! 
0	It looks like a 4-star! At least the worst service among the 4-stars I've stayed in. No service at all! Reception: No greetings, no smiles, no thanks. Like a robot. Everywhere is empty. The bathtub is broken , I’m lazy to ask them to fix it, because I have taken off my clothes. It’s really bad, the breakfast situation is like a food stall. Additional comment October 24, 2006: Of course, in general, as Hotels in medium-sized cities are probably almost like this. At least safe and comfortable. 
0	I wasted my RMB. What I read on the CD-ROM doesn’t match the words in the book.-It’s always missing one. I’m really angry... 
1	Find an external optical drive and install XP! The speed can still drop, it feels faster than my 2003 Ben 4! 
1	My daughter is almost four years old. Half a year ago, she bought a 3-4 year old book with magic stickers for kids on Dangdang. The daughter was not very interested at that time, so she patiently helped her finish the 3 books together, but Recently, she turned over the books again. She tore off the stickers that had been pasted, and then put them on again. She also said to me: Mom, I like books with stickers. It just so happened that my daughter’s birthday was approaching, so I ordered another set of 4-5 year old children’s magic stickers and gave it to her. The daughter who got the book stared at me every day and asked me to accompany her with the stickers, which was very happy. 
1	High performance-price ratio, I used the 10-inch N270 netbook and then used the 14-inch full-size keyboard, which is much more comfortable. It's good without a system, and saves a lot of money. The advantage of Fengrui is cold. HP's computer can be used to roast old cold legs. I bought one at the beginning of the year and it is super cold. When placing the order, the description did not include a camera, and it is convenient to pick up the goods with a camera. 
1	Check in on March 25 and check out on March 28. The room was good and the service was good. It was a little farther away from the subway. It takes about 15 minutes from Tsim Sha Tsui to the hotel. If you are not particularly nervous, you can consider staying. The breakfast was good. 
0	I read it patiently, just to talk more about it. Such books will also become popular, which shows that the reading level of our public is really not very good! 
1	Lived 4 years ago. Hotel facilities are worth the price, especially during Golden Week. The seaside location is very good. On the upper floors, most rooms can see the sea. The attitude of the lady at the front desk was very blunt, and none of the registered names was correct. Forget it, don't care if it doesn't affect the living. 
1	1. From order to delivery, it is completed within 24 hours. Jingdong's speed is very satisfying. I like it. 2. The first time I bought something on JD.com, I was generally satisfied, but the dress code of the staff in JD’s pick-up office needs to be improved. 3. The machine is very easy to use, no problems so far. 4. The whole installation time was 4 hours without any problems, which was very unexpected. . . 
0	The suite area is quite large. The most surprising thing was that the four treasures of the study were placed on the desk, and almost moved the idea of leaving the calligraphy here for a visit. In the end it was nothing. The bed is big, but the sheets are not too comfortable. The landscape restaurant is too expensive to recommend. The quality of the housing guests is not high, and they feel like a gathering place for township entrepreneurs. Choose 4 stars next time. 
1	"XP only needs to change the startup item to CD first, after booting, when the ASUS logo appears, press F2 to enter the BIOS, select ""Storage Configuration"" to enter, and then change ""Configure SATA as"" from AHCI mode to IDE compatibility mode and install it directly The plate is ready. "
0	The hotel equipment is outdated, the service is poor, not as good as the two-star standard. What is even more depressing is that I got off the train at 7:30 in the morning and arrived at the hotel, but was told to check in until nine o'clock, otherwise I would have to add half a day's rent. As a result, in order to avoid freezing, an extra 250 yuan was paid. As a result, Ctrip is not my score. Really wronged. 
1	The author liked to read when he was a teenager, and he could see that he had read countless classics intensively, so he had a huge inner world. There are two most valuable aspects of his works. One is that his knowledge of science is good. Although it can't match Russell, his articles are more readable than writers with poor science knowledge; the other is his personality and style. It's simple, not pretentious, not fancy, it makes people like. Reading his works is like listening to a friend talking to you, often arousing strong resonance in your heart. His works are better after 90 years. I sincerely wish Zhou Guoping health and happiness, and write more good works for the world. 
1	"Every time I read this kind of book, I always benefit a lot. We are running around in a bustling society, so we need this kind of book to help us. Let us understand the preciousness of the body, cherish our lives, and more importantly, it teaches us how to protect and repair our bodies, to live a better life, and to better realize our ideals in life. It is recommended that everyone should have this kind of books, and read more when they have time to make their life easier and more enjoyable. When you try according to the ""will"" of the book, you may get more. Stay healthy! "
1	The rooms in Building 7 are very good, although they may not be as good as other higher-class rooms. The service quality of the service staff is very good, at least I have the best service in Changchun several times. The environment around the hotel is very nice and quiet. In other seasons, you may feel the fragrance of birds and flowers. I had a good rest at night and there was no harassment on the phone. The room can be connected to the internet at average speed. But our room network seems to be a bit problematic. A network technician came here, but the level is average. 
0	The rough edges of the book are on every page, as if they were not cut! It's a pirated book! Don't Dangdang own books regardless of the binding quality? Such book sellers are too embarrassed! 
1	On May 1st, I went to Henan with my unit leader and my family for a few days. Picking out a few major attractions was a walk through, and then I went back to my hometown in Shanxi. I had already roughly arranged a few days before. Itinerary, visiting relatives and sightseeing, but so, more did not plan, this should be attributed to the short time and the lack of homework before leaving. After reading this book, I have a sharp increase in regret, this is fine, or otherwise Where can I still want to go back...So, before going to a place, it is best to do your homework 
0	The name of the book is definitely to please people. I believe that many people like me, bought this book because of the title. There is nothing new in the content of the book, it is the one taught by my parents and teachers when I was young. Can be a determined reader. 
0	Ordered on March 1st, and it hasn't arrived on March 15th. The customer service said every day that the next working day will arrive for 5 consecutive days. I am speechless. Those who want to read this book earlier should go to Taobao or Zhuoyue to order, especially friends from Guangdong Province. Dangdang delivery is too unguaranteed. 
0	The room is a bit old, it should be renovated, otherwise it will go downhill 
1	The facade is too small, the room is small, even taxi drivers are not familiar with it, it needs improvement 
1	My baby is now 4 months old, and breast milk is in a marginal stage. Before reading this book, I strengthened my determination to breast milk, because the emergence of problem milk powder made me believe that I would not give my life to milk powder. After reading this book, I became more determined. Sometimes I read this book when I was shaken. It can also be said that this book gave me great courage. The book says a lot of the benefits of breast milk, but when the baby is crying desperately with insufficient breast milk, I personally think that the advice given is too theoretical, and I haven't clearly stated how to add complementary foods. I can only say that this book has the effect of boosting morale~~~~~~~ 
1	I read other people’s reviews and I was not very prepared. After I arrived, I was really surprised. I stayed at the Regal Hotel for 3 days. Although the room was not very big, it was Enough, the room is newly renovated, very nice, and very romantic, with mirrors on all sides, it feels good, the attitude of the service staff is also good, when I arrived at the hotel on the first day, I forgot my luggage, the hotel is also specialized Calling to inquire, an old gentleman also helped us to collect the luggage, the check-in speed is also very fast, there is no feeling of discrimination in Mandarin, the traffic is far from the subway, but the surrounding buses and minibuses Convenient, we went to a total of five people, so taking a taxi to the subway station is more cost-effective than minibuses and buses. The surrounding Festival City and Xincheng are good places for shopping. There are many snacks, tea restaurants, and dessert shops nearby. The durian in the sweet and slippery dessert shop is very good. In general, this hotel is still very cost-effective. I will go there in the future. In addition, you can also book a direct train to Disney at the hotel. Very convenient. The surrounding environment is not very modern, but it has no impact. 
1	The configuration is considered high-end and running flash and photoshop and word at the same time did not feel slow. The white indicator light of the power supply, etc. of the machine is very beautiful. Built-in microphone and camera. Video is more convenient and user-friendly. There are many more user-friendly settings, such as the warning sound when the power is plugged in or unplugged. It is easy to control the working time. Mute key, shortcut navigation key, etc. There are still some excellent UE designs. Generally, there are several power modes to choose from. Fast delivery and good service. 
0	There is a gray dot on the screen and I want to exchange it. Jingdong said no. The keyboard on the screen is lower than the hand, and the driver installation is a bit troublesome! ~ 
0	The screen of the machine sent here is 1680*1050, not the 1440*900 introduced in the introduction. The characters are too small after the resolution is high, and it is not convenient to read the document... 
0	hp 6535B (VA051PA) Brand new. I bought it on JD. It had an invoice. It was sold at a loss due to urgent need. The invoice dated June 1, 2009, with complete packaging. 13774321320 Mr. Li (No. 63, Chifeng Road, Shanghai) 
1	"The location is super good. It only takes 4 minutes to walk to the Bund. It is indeed the gold in the prime location. The room is large and clean. I am very satisfied with the facilities in the room. The internet speed is like flying. It is very quiet at night. It is an indescribable enjoyment to enjoy the scenery of the Huangpu River outside the window in the silence. It is recommended that friends who come to Shanghai for the first time choose a river view room. The breakfast is good, hearty, high-quality food, and a lot of choices. Dinner is a la carte. If you choose a location close to the window, it is really a dream. It is more suitable for families, couples, or business negotiations. The bar on the 31st floor is the highest bar I've ever been to, with the most special view and the best service. If there are more, I will know everything by myself. The two words describe ""dream"". The reception desk and concierge service of the hotel are attentive and enthusiastic. It is indeed a hotel under the umbrella of an international management group. No matter what aspect of the service is really attentive and attentive, if there is a chance to come to Shanghai in the future, I would love to live here again. "
1	There are really a lot of Japanese people. The layout of the old hotel room is okay, but the carpet smells too much, the air in the room is not good, and the windows do not open well. The service is okay, the transportation is convenient, and it is very convenient to go to the railway station, express train, and scenic spots, but the environment is rather chaotic next to the railway station. The price of the room is a bit more expensive, and it is basically relatively competitive. 
0	My son is 39 months old. Although he doesn't understand this book well, he has initially shown interest in this book. Said to learn from Carmela and use it to overcome difficulties continuously! I hope Dangdang will sell interesting and educational children's books! 
1	The price is high, the appearance is dazzling, and it looks good in comparison. The sound is my most satisfied part, the sound effect is very good! ! ! 
1	The book is here on the 25th. I’m free to rate it today. It’s frozen. I want to read it again. I like the texture of the cover. I like the font. It’s a lot bigger. I hope that the depth of Aimo can penetrate everyone. Heart, above-four four 
1	1. The screen is good, no dead pixels and bright spots. 2. The configuration at this price is relatively high and there is no problem in general use. 3. If you remember correctly, it is a two-year warranty. This price has a one-year warranty, which is cost-effective! 4. It is a full-size keyboard, which is a little surprise. However, due to the extra numeric keypad, the keyboard layout is crowded. 
1	At this price, with this configuration, it should be more value-for-money. The whole machine is also in good working conditions. The appearance is overall stylish. The shortcut keys on the upper part of the keyboard are very convenient. Driver, unfortunately does not support page scrolling. 
1	It took a short time to read this book. After reading the beginning, I couldn't wait to read the following content. After reading it, I sigh deeply! I am now the mother of a 2-month-old girl, and I was greatly inspired by this book. The author is the mother of two girls. She used the tone of a mother to tell the story of her and her daughters during several migrations. She did not teach you how to raise a pair of lovely daughters, but told you her. Experience, every mother has different experiences in raising children, but there is something in common, that is, love! 
0	The heat generation is large, the battery power supply time is short, the sensitivity of the handwriting screen is not high, and no direct handwriting input method is found. 
1	Staying again, the service is as always, impeccable, but the price of Ctrip is a bit expensive~ 
1	cheap price. Relatively light and power saving. It comes with XP and vista driver CD, which is better than thinkpad, so you don't need to find it on the website, which is very convenient. 
0	The quality of the book is good, but the content is really boring. I thought it would focus on psychological analysis, but it was actually about extramarital affairs. 
0	Don’t live here during this time, they are noisy! Moreover, the prompt in the room said that the construction started at 8:30, and the structure started at 7:40. I asked them to solve it all morning, and it has not stopped until 8:30! By 8:30 they will be more reasonable and continue to start construction! 
1	This set of books is good and the price is moderate. The key is that the hand-painted pictures give people a closer feel. Maybe when we were young, we didn't have the conditions to get in touch with the outside world, let alone get in touch with the past. What we saw was probably nothing more than the Kesai or Saint Seiya. Because of this, now I don’t want my child to know only Ultraman and Duolai Ameng. I want the child to learn more knowledge and let her know that human wisdom has created such a wonderful civilization, which is an improvement for the child And rich, it is a kind of compensation psychology to oneself. 
1	1. High cost performance; 2. Good heat dissipation; 3. Noisy; 4. Touch multimedia keys are stylish, but not as easy to use as a knob; 5. The notebook is well made and the appearance is good. 
1	Very affordable, but inflexible arrangements. I hope I can make more progress and come here next time. 
0	The frame is indeed wide; if you use 1280X800 for word processing on 12, your eyes are still a bit tired; hard disk partitioning is done by people with mental disabilities, but it doesn’t matter, you just got a 320 hard 
0	The baby is one year old and seven months old. I don't like it too much, maybe because the colors are not bright enough. And for him, it may be too simple. 
0	Fortunately, I only bought one copy and only wasted a few yuan. I think Chinese people have always liked to look at some things in a swarm, without their own subjective judgments. This book, how ridiculous, what is the difference between Carmela, no Did you lay the eggs too? It's so humble to lay eggs again. This is called self-inflict. If you teach your children in this way and let them take detours, will it be different? 
0	Obviously I bought 6 books, but only got 3, and I didn't say what the reason was. How can I believe it in the future? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
1	This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel, and it feels like the first time I have lived in the room facing the Liujiang River. The view is better, but this time the road in front of the hotel has been repaired and the traffic is very convenient. The hotel staff is still as always Smile service, I especially recommend the revolving restaurant on the 30th floor. Come here for dinner when night falls, and the scenery on both sides of the Liujiang River is beautiful. However, this hotel is not suitable for long-distance calls, 1.8 yuan/minute, which is the phone charge I have ever stayed in The highest one. Hotel feedback August 7, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and love to our hotel. Liuzhou Hotel is committed to building the most cost-effective hotel in Liuzhou. The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
0	A very painful experience. The guest rooms are on the 9th floor and above. It seems that from the 3rd floor or the 5th floor to the 8th floor, they are all nightclubs, and there are Japanese KTVs, so it is very noisy at 10 pm, and I feel that the whole room is After following the earthquake, I lived on the 9th floor on the first day. I found out after I went to bed at night, so I hardly slept. The next day I moved to the 14th floor and I was basically able to accept it, but I still felt the vibration. Don’t live if the vibration is stronger, I can’t stand it, but my friend seems to feel average, okay. But I didn’t get much rest at all. This holiday was almost ruined. Fortunately, I went to Hong Kong on the third day. The room rate is still 380, I can't live in the future. The waiter is okay, there is still one thing to say. Additional comment October 9, 2007: In addition, the room is super small, terrifying, and it is almost the same as the 168 fast hotel. This is still a 4-star standard. 
1	Xiaotang has many books, and there are many different titles of the same edition. I was confused when I bought it. Therefore, please proofread by Dangdang staff, agree to the caliber, and let consumers buy it, so that it will not be in the cloud. It's hard work. The printing quality of this book is very good. Because it was appointed by my son's piano teacher, I went to Dangdang to search for it. After I got the book, I found it good. The only regret is that the quality of the included vcd is not good, and Kong Xiangdong's explanation is always stuck. Actually it doesn’t matter, after all, books are teaching materials 
0	From the perspective of the text of the novel, it is very general. Its success is the blessing of fast food culture and so-called success learning. 
1	The first time I booked a hotel online, the price is 428 yuan, I feel that the room is relatively poor. I used to book a room under the name of a friend’s company every time I came to Uzbekistan. The price was very favorable. This time I booked it by myself. For a room of 428 yuan, only 320 yuan is enough... 
0	"Just read Mr. Nan Huaijin's ""The Analects of Confucius"" and discover how superficial Yu Dan's experience is. It feels like Nan Huaijin and Yu Dan are together like a university professor and a pupil together. "
1	The room is spacious and clean. There is a small LCD TV on the wall. The bathroom does not have a bathtub and can only shower, but it is not a problem. Changning Road is a big road, but because the hotel is located in an alley, the environment is relatively quiet. I prefer Jin Jiang chef, cheap and delicious, and the service attitude is okay. The price of 229 yuan is indeed very competitive. There is a problem with the network speed, and there are often interruptions or connection failures. 
1	The cup is powerful, the workmanship is good, and the technology of the thinkpad R series is really good! Integrated graphics, ran 3dmark06, scored 792 points, no problem watching HD, no problem with World of Warcraft, Need for Speed has not tested yet, it is said that the effect of 800*600 is very smooth for all meetings! 
0	My dissatisfaction with the product is mainly in terms of service. First: JD’s customer service phone is always unavailable. Second: I want a gray one, and give me a white one. 
1	The quality of the rooms and the environment is definitely 5 stars. The quality of the food is excellent. It's just far from the city center. But the hotel has a shuttle bus. If you can catch the shuttle bus, it's perfect. 
0	Only the driver of vista, the drivers of other systems are not even on the official ASUS website, and you have to find them one by one on the Internet, not good 
0	There was only one computer, bag, mouse... nothing was given, and there was not a mouse, too stingy! The invoice is said to be issued separately from the computer and other things, and Jingdong will not mess with it! 
1	The first time I saw the introduction of this book was in a newspaper, many critics gave this book a high evaluation, and bought it out of curiosity about Central Asia. When I first saw it, I felt a little bored because I didn't know anything about climbing. Later, I was a little worried. How could a poor person like Mortensen fulfill his promise? When he went through hardships to turn his first promise into reality, I actually had a heart-wrenching excitement! Just like, I also participated in this commitment journey~~ A very touching novel, worthy of everyone's taste! 
1	"I stayed here for the first time, I paid special attention to everyone's opinions, and it feels like this! 1. Although the standard room is a bit old but very clean, the quilt is very comfortable and warm, and the bathroom is quite large, because it is quite close to many commercial centers. 2. The hotel service is not bad, not like what is said here. It is very fast when checking in and checking out. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied. 3. Breakfast is also ok, the environment is also good, a bit of Jiangnan feeling; there are many varieties of dishes, very delicious. 4. It may be in the city or very close to the railway station, which is a bit ""lively"". It is not convenient for people who come to me to do business, but fortunately there is an underground parking lot. Overall, I feel very good and highly recommended! ! ! "
1	The hardware configuration is the highest in the netbook, and the battery is also the most powerful. The black paint shell is very beautiful, and the hardware driver under the XP system is provided in the box. . . 
1	It’s a very good book. We have always used the impression our parents left us in educating our children. Using some unscientific methods can easily lead to children’s rebellion. My daughter is 5 years old and often makes me cry with anger. This book has really been improved. I followed the requirements of this book. Although it was a bit awkward at first, it is very effective when I get used to it. My daughter is now more obedient than before. It is not so much to change the child. It is better to say that it is to change the parents. If the parents' method is right, the children will naturally be obedient. This book is worth reading as a parent! 
1	Generally speaking, I like Sofitel very much. I didn't want to live in Sofitel this time because of the Tibet independence incident, but the guests liked it and I felt good overall. 
1	Breakfast is ok, the room is average, but the soundproofing effect is very good, although it is a big road, but there is no ridicule 
1	The price/performance ratio is very high! The original bag that comes with it is also very good. I brought it up by myself. I visited it once (at the point on Zhangyang Road in Shanghai). Compared with the last time, the improvement is: it provides DIY seats for customers and has wireless network. Access service, good 
1	Hotel facilities are more general, but the sheets and towels are white and clean, and the service is warm. Perhaps the hotel was built in the early years, and the underground garage does not have direct access to the lobby, which is not very convenient. Meals are very suitable for those who are addicted to spicy food. It would be better to add some non-spicy dishes if you can take care of visitors from north to south. Also hope to pass service skills. 
0	The four-star hotel in Pingyao is actually only two and a half stars. The service of the state-run guest house 20 years ago was very poor. Probably because of the lack of occupants, the rooms are closed for a long time, the rooms in the west wing of the hotel have a musty smell, and the toilet still smells bad. It is recommended to insist on a room in the east wing of the hotel. -The hotel does not accept credit cards, only cash. Guests cannot sign orders for consumption in the restaurant and must pay in cash. -The shampoo/bath lotion provided by the hotel is of poor quality. The toilet paper is stained with mildew. It is highly recommended to bring your own shampoo and toilet paper to avoid accidents. -The hotel’s bedding is “one-for-one-change”, and the guest stays in the shop without changing the sheets. -Breakfast is very poor, basically vegetarian. -The baggage student recommends the chartered service to slaughter customers crazy. A half-day chartered car (Xia Li) to the Wang's Compound actually asked for 400 yuan back and forth. I went out and stopped the street for only 200 yuan (30 yuan for the high-speed toll for the round trip), or Santana 2000. But it is said that other hotels in Pingyao are more terrible. Planning to live in Pingyao, Lize Court is a helpless choice. 
0	The heat dissipation is not very good! ! The right palm rest is hot after being used for a long time, other places are fine! ! And the screen shakes quite badly! ! ! This is not as strong as Thinkpad! ! 
0	: The color of the screen is a bit light and not bright. Can you tune it? Please tell me. Dolby sound is average. There is no bass at all. Just a subwoofer. 
1	When the plane was rescheduled, the check-in was done very quickly. When the reservation was made, the request was met without relying on the road. There were people on duty on the 4th floor and caring about this. The single room is not very big but the layout is reasonable, so the space is enough The bathroom is simple and clean. The bathroom is simple enough. The hot water is in good condition. The water temperature is also suitable. The soundproofing effect of the room is relatively poor (referring to the walkway). You can hear the crowds on the walkway in the morning. If you want to sleep late in the morning, You have to hang out the'DND' sign, otherwise the waiter will knock on the door after 8 o'clock. The room attendant is very polite and if you want to move, they will ask you in advance and knock on the door and say hello to you when you go out and meet them. They are determined You say hello. The broadband internet speed in the room is very slow and often disconnected. Also, from 9:30 in the evening, someone will definitely call to ask if you want a pedicure and you will receive a card on the ground next to the door in the morning. . . I think the security guard at the door of Lenovo is not very caring, as if I see you take a lot of things, I can’t come to help you mention it. The transportation is very convenient. There are cars in Xizhimen and Xidan Zoo. There are many cars nearby and there are quite a lot of places to eat. Okay, by the way, it’s very inconvenient to walk with a lot of cars parked at the door 
0	The common problem of small screen notebooks is that the keyboard is a bit cramped and not suitable for men. The inner bag is slightly larger. The battery life seems to be only about 6 hours. Office is not pre-installed. I downloaded and installed 2007 by myself. The system partition is too large. Use Partition Magic to adjust D drive to 130G, and the rest to C drive 
0	This book is one of the more rewarding books I read in 2008. Some opinions in the book break some of my usual ideas. The author answers certain personal opinions about the confusion that appeared in the twenty-year-old age group. It is worth seeing for girls at this age. 
1	The hotel is very close to the long-distance bus station, which is only a 5-minute walk away. The overall environment is good and the rooms are very clean. I stayed in a standard room. As a three-star hotel, I feel good. The service attitude is very satisfactory. Walking along the road in front of the hotel is Mingsha Mountain. A taxi is 10 yuan, a bus is 1 yuan, and there is a stop in front of the hotel. It is said to be the most expensive hotel in Dunhuang. But I only stayed for one night and it didn't matter. 
1	It is the best hotel in the area, but there are some gaps from hotels in the city. 
1	"I did not expect my daughter who had just passed her fourth birthday would be very interested in this book. To be honest, when I first got this book, I was very confused, because as some comments have written, the pictures are messy and there are many knowledge points. I don’t know how to tell my children, so I tried to tell. After reading ""Underwater Adventure"", I didn't expect my children would love to listen to it. After I finished speaking, I asked, ""Are there any more?"" In the past two days, I kept asking me a question repeatedly, ""Why are their school buses so amazing?"" "
0	The wireless network card does not have a switch, you need to use the keyboard combination to turn on the wireless network card after each boot. Even without a switch, it can automatically turn on the wireless network card as soon as it is turned on like a dell home machine. 
0	The machine is a bit heavy and it is not suitable to be carried out. JD’s customer service phone is too difficult to make, and it’s basically a display. The temperature on the touchpad is high. The box has been opened, somehow. 
0	I was unlucky to find that there was a problem with the microphone of the computer, and the other party couldn't hear me clearly when I was talking on Skype, so I have already sent back a replacement. Hope it's only an individual case. 
0	Slightly hot, acceptable. . The quality of the speakers is average, but I always check the subwoofer and use headphones outside. . . . . . 
1	The bed in the deluxe double room is very big. A single bed is already as big as the double bed I live in Hong Kong. Some details are also quite interesting, like the small envelope on the bedside will have a candy and will tell you tomorrow The weather. The towels are a bit old. There is no line for drying clothes in the bathroom. Additional comment February 28, 2007: The outside is a bit old and dirty. When we first arrived, we were still hesitating whether to change one. Later we saw The inside is still good, it's time to decorate the outside 
0	The paint on the silver side may be worn off in the future. I feel that the 16:9 screen is too flat, after all, it is the web page that you see more. It is better to buy the old 4:3 14-inch screen. It is recommended to buy a 16:10 screen (movie hobby Except for those). 
0	The transportation is convenient. There are buses 34 and 9 to the Yellow River at the door, and bus 1 to the city center. The hotel room facilities were outdated. After I entered the door and inserted the key card to get the electricity, I discovered that the kettle was empty. Later, I learned that the kettle was faulty and would not automatically cut off the power. I told the waiter who delivered the breakfast about it, but there was no response. The headrest cushion is torn. Possibly due to the water quality, the washbasin, bathtub, and toilet have many marks, they look very dirty, and the carpet is not clean. Breakfast is delivered to the room at the time requested by the guest (7:00-9:00). There are too many to eat, and the quality is average. It seems to be the things sold at the market stall next to the train station. The room deposit is paid day by day. It should be noted that the waiter will ask you if you want an invoice during the checkout, and the invoice will automatically add 2 yuan a day to the original price without any prior explanation. 
1	The book is good because it was confirmed that the computer was not running when the delivery was delivered by the cash on delivery post office, and the computer was not running afterwards, and the quality was guaranteed. 
1	The hotel is not bad, the rooms are not big, but more comfortable. There are only Starbucks and KFC under the hotel, and it’s a bit far from the New World for dinner. 
0	"Every book is like this, it looks like a pirated book. If it is published and printed in a regular manner, how can the quality of the cover be guaranteed? ! My son is only 6 months old. I haven't read it yet. I will comment on the ""connotation"" of this book after reading it. . . . Really, taking it out shocked me "
1	The price is good, the machine is good in workmanship, you can buy Xiao Hei at this price, it is too worth it, and other brands are not considered 
0	After I bought something in the store, I always called me, saying that I became their member because I bought something, and then I promoted Dae Jang Geum, health care products and so on. How many have I received? Ten, so annoying. Dangdang's management of the shop in the shop is too bad, how can we give our contact number to others casually. It's been almost half a year, and there are still calls. It's really intolerable and annoying. 
1	All kinds of leisure and entertainment facilities are complete, the transportation is convenient, and the food tastes diverse. Overall feeling: Comfortable Free registration Site navigation Hotel index Service description About Ctrip Looking for talents Agency cooperation Advertising business Contact us Copyright1999-2008, ctrip.com. all rights reserved. 
0	It's good compared to the farm in the mountains. The walls are cracked, the room is fairly clean, it's 1 kilometer from the town, and it only costs 2 yuan to call a car. There is Shanghai Hualian in the town, which is quite big, and it is very convenient to buy some food and drink. 
0	1. The service is poor. I booked a big bed room with video network. When I checked in, I found that there was no computer in the hotel. The hotel didn’t tell me until I checked out that because the room type was full, without notice, I took the initiative to change a room for me, a superior double room with a price of 358. When I proposed to consolidate the bills of the consumption list, the service staff even asked for a fee of 5 yuan. People can't be shameless to this point! 2. The room number I live in is 2727. The room is too small. There is only a stool for watching TV. In other words, a guest can only sit on the bed. 3. Insufficient hardware equipment. There is no luggage rack for luggage, no line for drying clothes. 4. It is not convenient to get in and out of the hotel by taxi. The hotel is located at a corner far away from the road. It is very inconvenient for taxis to pass through a stop. Moreover, the entrance of the hotel is small, so taxis can only park five or six meters away from the hotel. inconvenient. 
0	It’s too heavy. It seems to be heavier than other brands of 14-inch phones. Why it says 2.6kg on it, but the gross weight is 3.6 on the computer package. I don’t know if it’s because I'm too memorized or something. The book is not useful yet. The problem, I have to go to after-sales maintenance, too much trouble! 
1	The location is very good and the transportation is convenient. Comfortable room and good service 
1	The hotel I stayed in at the end of May is still okay for Samsung, the price is not expensive, maybe its location is not a prosperous place. The receptionist at the front desk has a bad attitude, and the room is good. It may be the reason for booking from Ctrip. Generally, the room location is good. 
1	"This is a very recommended book. After reading it, I have gained a lot and I have recommended it to my friends, hoping to be helpful to others. Living in a complex world, it’s not easy not to complain, but ""The World Without Complaining"" uses simple methods to help you control your own language, so that you can adjust your thoughts to a positive direction. Will change their life unconsciously. Let us enter the world of no complaints, it must be a different world! "
0	1. No heating, suspected of deceiving. Stayed in a double room on the 28th. Due to the severe temperature drop in recent days, before booking a room, I specifically called to ask if the room has heating. The answer was yes. When I checked in on the 28th, I reconfirmed whether there is heating or not. I replied: Yes. Turn on the heating after entering the room, and after a simple wash, go to bed quickly. As a result, I was awake in the middle of the night and the room was very cold. I tried the exhaust vent and found that it was all cold and fainted. Quickly call the customer service staff. The customer service staff has a very good attitude and said to check the room immediately. When the customer service staff found out that it was cold, they said there was no way to solve it and suggested that I put on more quilts. faint! Looking at the time, it was already more than 2 o'clock in the morning. There is no alternative but to obediently take out the spare quilt in the room. When I got up in the morning, I got a fever and a cold. Annoyed ~~~~~, quickly change the hotel with luggage. I reacted with the front desk in the morning, the front desk staff was expressionless, don't know why? 2. There is no bedding on the Simmons, and a layer of sheets is laid directly on the Simmons. I don't know how many years the Simmons has been used. It's super uncomfortable; in such a cold weather, there is no mattress underneath, and the room is not heated. This is cold. Never dare to live in such a hotel again. 3. An umbrella was pulled in the room, but no one reminded me when I checked out. I found out after a long time. Although it is just an umbrella, why can't it remind the guests? Is it difficult? 
0	The 667M bus is matched with DDR2 533 memory, which is very unreasonable. The weight is really heavy, but it is much lighter than ordinary notebooks. The heat generation at the bottom center is relatively large, but the current temperature of about 25 degrees is still acceptable. . 
0	It's a bit heavy, which is a pity. I can buy such a small notebook because I hope it can be carried easily. The size is OK, if it is thinner and lighter, it will be more perfect. There is no optical drive, so ASUS needs to improve. Then, although the shell is painted, it is very beautiful (do not touch), because it will leave fingerprints when you touch it 
1	The sapphire blue is very beautiful, the machine is also very stable, and the heat dissipation is good. I haven't heard the fan ring, and I haven't found any problems after using it for a few days. 
0	I have bought <<How to say that children will listen, and how to listen to children before they are willing to say>>. I found that many examples in these two books are the same. I am sure that there are many plagiarisms in them. Disappointed!!! 
1	Convenient transportation, it is the best choice to go to Nanjing Pedestrian Street. However, the restaurant's business hours (especially the Chinese restaurant) are a bit inconvenient. There is no lunch until 2:30 noon. You know, this Chinese food is a little famous. 
1	There is a high u, but it hasn't been tested yet, and I don't know how it works. Very quiet. Although the graphics card is integrated, you can still play Warcraft. 
0	It seems that buying a pirated version is a chance. The first four of the ten pictures are good, the fifth one is not available, and the other four pictures are good, and there is sound at the top, but there is no sound at the back. 
1	High performance-price ratio, good-looking, and everything is there! Why do so many people still want XP? VISTA is good, I installed Windows7, and the installation of MacOS 10.5 failed! 
1	This book is not so much to teach parents how to educate their children, as it is to teach parents how to educate themselves. Great book! I have read many parenting books at home and abroad. This is the one that is closest to our lives and combines theory and practice best. The book uses the author’s daughter as an example, but there is nothing to show off. Although every child is different, and the situation every parent encounters is definitely different, we can learn from it what to use The heart treats children, this is essentially the same. I hope everyone will benefit and grow up happily with our children. 
0	"""What a clever'Little Nizi'"" Dude! Why did you set a trap yourself without putting any bait? Others sneered and sneered. In the end, did you step in? ? ""My body is gray...your bright red and white."" En En En, yes yes, Confucius is gray, and you are bright. ""In the eyes of you beauties, what does Confucius look like?"" Oh, what a benevolence in the hearts of beauties! It is no wonder that Yi Lao reminds everyone in front of the book that this book ""cannot be read with a human heart, but a woman's heart!"". "
0	The response is still a bit slow, maybe the netbook is just like this, Jingdong estimates that the request when placing the order is not seen at all, the service needs to be improved. 
1	The book is very good, the size of Carmela, and there are so many stories in different styles that children find it very exciting. The child is about to go to elementary school. My method is to first tell him twice, and then let him tell me. The child is very happy and has exercised his presentation skills. I plan to let him read the phonetic notation after learning Pinyin, so he can really start reading independently. Some book reviews say it is not as good as Carmela, and I feel that each has its own strengths. Carmela is more exciting and has a strong plot; ladder reading is more warm and lovely, and it is better than having a variety of stories. It is recommended to buy all of them for children, there are not too many books. 
0	I really don’t know how this book is popular in Korea. It’s so boring and empty. I can’t read it after reading a few pages. It’s obvious that his writing is very large and thick. 
1	"Youth is a Chinese year, with agile knees and a rose-like face. Youth is an infinite creativity and a stream of clear springs surging in the depths of life. Just like the title of the book ""The Song of Weiyang"", youth is a song. The endless hymns, the poetic hymns of the readers, my heart was intoxicated and melted, as if I was returning to the yearning era. It was an era of war, but it was also a shining era. The young heart followed them with joy and sorrow. From them, I saw truth, goodness, beauty, and felt hope. They mirrored my shortcomings like a mirror. "
1	The MM at the front desk is very good, efficient and has a very good attitude. 
0	My lord is in room 709. The air conditioner in this room is loud (you can hear it outside the door). The bathtub has no anti-slip mat. The faucet of the bathtub will fall off with a light touch. There is no general lighting control in the room. The phone turned out to be broken and there was no sound. The entrance of the hotel is hard to find, and the front desk is not only small but also chaotic. 
1	I thought it was a very simple and old-fashioned story, but I didn't expect it to make me unforgettable when I read it. Modern urban life is busy every day, with increasing work pressure, but boring and numb. what is love? Can two people really stay together for a lifetime? Very often confused and doubtful. After reading this book, although I knew it was a written story, it touched me a lot. The protagonist’s dedication to love and sincere dedication made my heart full, and life can be dull, as long as I have true love People who work together for a lifetime is enough! 
1	"By the way, there is an unforgettable thing I forgot to write. It is the beginning of this book that Zhimin just went to the Mo family to meet the Mo brothers when the author wrote that it was called a ""crimp""! What about the two sons of the Mo family are so gloomy that they can be read directly as horror and thriller novels. Coupled with their mother, it reminds me of Mr. Tang Seng’s wise saying: People are fucking humans, and demons are fucking demons... "
0	I thought that the hotel was as proud as its name, but whoever expected it was not worthy of its name. I went on May Day. The hotel facilities are outdated and the sanitation environment is poor. The room equipment is shabby and outdated, and the color is dark. It's not a star standard, it's a hotel, with very few breakfast varieties, you will be full, and you will never stay again next time! 
1	The biggest advantage is the strong battery life, which is one of the core competitiveness of netbooks. 
1	When I went to Luoyang on the 11th, I lived in this hotel. The general feeling is that the location is good. There is a bus to the Longmen Grottoes at 1 yuan. It is very convenient (I took a taxi and only spent 30 yuan) The reception is very enthusiastic, but the disadvantage is that the room is really small, a four-star room is a bit unreasonable, but it is not bad that there is a computer in the room. 
1	"I have stayed in a lot of hotels, but I have never commented on it. This time I have a sea view and I feel so touched that I must talk about it. The high-quality services evaluated by all the guests above will not be repeated, because these are in line with the ""five-star standard"", but the service of the sea view does start from the needs of the guests and think about it. Let’s talk about an example. This time, I was unlucky enough to suffer from acute gastroenteritis in Qingdao. I had to go to the hospital to hang water early in the morning. The hotel sent someone to accompany me. The little girl carried a very heavy bag. At first we didn't know what it was. Later, when we went to the hospital, we learned that it contained a thermos, quilt, towel and fruit. After arranging the water before and after the run, the doctor said that we could eat some fruit, but found that the bananas and oranges we brought were not good, so I immediately ran outside to buy a bag of apples and blanched them with boiling water. Because we heard that she was actually off work, we tried our best to let her go back to rest, but she insisted on refusing. During the process of more than 2 hours, she always sat across from me with a smile to see what I needed. When I saw my arm was cold Went to iron the towel and put it on me, poured water and took things without stopping. Later, we finally knew why she refused to leave because she had to wait until the order was over and asked the hotel to send a car to pick her up. Within 5 minutes of returning to the hotel, the porridge was delivered to the room-these are services we did not request. When I left the store and waited for the shuttle bus, I shrank on the sofa with a fever, and someone immediately brought a blanket. After asking about the situation, a hot ginger soup was delivered after a while, and then we found that the empty space above my head was quietly turned off. ..... Too many details are a bit verbose, but I am really moved. A friend said that maybe it is because of the Olympics to establish an image, but I don't think it is. Many things can be regulated and can be trained, but the sense of service cannot be achieved overnight. Going to Qingdao again, Seaview Garden is my only choice! Supplement: We want to give the waiter 200 yuan, because tipping is normal, not to mention that people are so hard before and after running, but she is determined not to! "
0	"The hotel's hardware is average and the service is poor. Because we take the children in a self-guided tour, we are afraid that if we don’t have time to come back, we will ask to leave one room first, and we will check out the other room until 1 pm. Finally, we left one room, moved everything to another room, turned on the do not disturb light and hung up the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign, but when we came back at 11 in the morning, we used our own room Card could not enter his room, and turned off the do not disturb light, and took off the sign. I asked the main station and said that our card has been changed, but our things are still in the room, so what happened? And it's not twelve o'clock noon! ! "
0	I have installed VISTA twice, using the OEM U version, it cannot be activated! Remind other buyers that unless you flash the BIOS and import the SLIC certificate, you don’t need to try other activation methods! The last XP installed! 
1	It's beautiful, the black paint and the white light are very bright, the configuration is already very high, the price is acceptable, and I have always loved Toshiba's books. 
1	Fashionable and portable. Good heat dissipation. It can be used for an hour at 20 degrees room temperature, the keyboard is cold, and the sides of the touchpad are slightly hot. The price is approachable, and it is very suitable as a netbook. The package comes with a white artificial leather liner bag with MSI logo, which matches well with the machine. Adequate interfaces, 3 USB, 1 card reader, plus LAN and display interface, to meet the basic peripheral needs. When in use, the MSI logo on the top cover will glow, which is very conspicuous when the light is low. It is a veritable ultra-thin notebook with a travel weight of less than 2kg. In general, this is a netbook with a clear positioning and an affordable price. 
0	The sound quality of the speakers is poor, the color reproduction of the LED screen is not true, the interface layout is not very reasonable, and the combo drive cannot burn DVD 
0	The location of the usb interface is not very good. One is on the back and two are on the left. Generally, the mouse is on the right. Only the USB interface is plugged into the back. The design is a little problematic. 
1	Ten years ago, Long Yingtai wrote a Wildfire Collection. It is very popular in Taiwan. Why, because it exposed the social truth in Taiwan at that time. It tells local students and people in the community how we can transform our homes. What I want to say is that common sense is just such a book that can teach us to see society clearly and the way forward. However, the result is not us, but the officials who we aspire to be more qualified. In any case, we should believe that if this democratic voice is not extinguished, our society will have hope. 
0	First of all, this book feels that I don’t like it very much in terms of printing and typesetting, and the language of the content is a bit exaggerated. 
0	The installation was troublesome. Later I installed VISTA and found a few blue screens when shutting down, but it is normal and remains to be seen. 
1	ST's hard drive, Samsung's DVD burner, AUO panel, Samsung memory, I bought the KINGSTON of Generpida particles by myself to form a dual channel, the keyboard feels good! The touchpad is great! Relatively thin! 
1	The overall feeling was good, although the price was relatively high. On the second night of my stay, the indoor temperature rose to 26 degrees. I asked the service center of the hotel. They said that because the weather outside was relatively cold (around 14-17 degrees), the air conditioning is now It’s just natural wind~~~ I said, it’s cold outside, but the room temperature is so high without windows, how to sleep?! The final answer is that the hotel refuses to turn on the air conditioner, so I took it Give me a fan!!! An international five-star hotel actually uses this method to deal with it. I am really disappointed. In addition, all services are within the standard. Therefore, in the future, everyone should choose to live in the summer or the normal In winter, otherwise there is no air conditioning. 
0	When I got the box, I saw that it was GL40. I was very disappointed and annoyed. No wonder Jingdong didn’t dare to label the chipset. It also said that it was related to the batch. The computer was bought like a lottery. The configuration was not transparent. If I knew it was GL40 in advance, absolutely I don’t know how to buy it, I feel cheated 
1	On July 1st and 2nd, I checked into the hotel’s deluxe sea-view room. I booked it after reading Ctrip’s reviews. Facing the sea, it was really good. In particular, the hotel has a lot of supporting recreational facilities, a very clean swimming pool, a 20% discount for in-house guests for bowling and golf driving range, and the attitude of the hotel staff is also very good. My son is particularly fond of this hotel, saying that he will stay in Weihai in the future. The breakfast buffet is less variety. 
1	I feel that this book does not need children to read. Teachers, principals, and parents all over China need to read it carefully. At the beginning, I read this book to increase my confidence in my son. Now, I have strengthened my belief in education. In fact, Xiaodoudou is normal, because everyone is a little deformed, she thinks she is not normal. Raising children into normal people is definitely unique. Only the robots on the assembly line are all the same. It's all so perfect. Children don’t need to read, adults just do 
1	I bought it in 618, I have been using Asus, it looks very beautiful, 16:9 widescreen HD is really cool! All configurations are just right. 
0	There is still room for price reduction. To modify XP, you need to install a SATA driver first. This is a common problem of SONY notebooks. Many people can't install the system at first because of this. XP drive SONY official website has a full set. 
0	I can only play on the computer and can’t install it, so the system is a hassle. I have to give it to my sister on the weekend. 
1	When you go out, you usually visit the local Home Inn first. This shop is pretty good. The price is high, the service is attentive enough and the response is quick. But I don't like their uniforms very much. They are colorful and ugly. By the way, it's just not very close to the station, the supermarket next to it, the food is suspected to be out of date (bread), and it is also far from the dinosaur park, but there is a bus stop at the door, which is quite convenient. Additional comments January 28, 2008: I was wrong, it was Huqiu, haha~~ 
1	There will be such a person, maybe he is not the one standing next to you at the moment, but he must be the only owner of that corner in your heart; he may not be the other half of you now, but he must be the position you once wished to have The person; he may not appear in your life again in this life, but he has become a part of your life for a while; maybe you have been trying hard to forget him, but everything that belongs to him is becoming clearer and clearer---- --He will never disappear, he will only get closer and closer to you as months go by, because once he was your favorite and you are his only. 
1	I started to book a single room for a large room, but I went to the hotel and told me that there was no Ctrip reservation. I was about to call to inquire and told me that there was another one. Go and see, the room is too small to fit a bed. So I retired and booked a business executive suite. The suites are not bad, the rooms are big, the facilities are always good, but the price is a bit expensive. The overall feeling is average. 
0	The surrounding environment and internal facilities of the hotel are generally good. But the service attitude is extremely bad, and it is almost defiant. When I checked in, I was filling out my check-in form. Suddenly, a few people in brighter clothes came over and put my ID card and credit card aside to help those people deal with it. After that, two more people came over, and then they dealt with them. After waiting for 20 minutes, I couldn't help but ask if I should do it. When checking out, I encountered the same situation. I was checking out, and when I saw a few foreigners coming, I jumped in and went through the process. I couldn't bear it, so I asked the waiter why, why did I answer you in a hurry? 
0	One word: bad! Poor facilities, poor service and poor environment. Everything I can think of is bad! ! ! ! ! Hotel Feedback December 10, 2007: The hotel has noticed, and some rooms have been opened for renovation 
0	The Samsung 1G gold bar sent is genuine. I was depressed because I didn't send me Rising Antivirus software when I placed the order. It took some time to install the system, and Lenovo has a lot of software. VISTA is not good, affecting the operating speed. Without a discrete graphics card, the partition is very unreasonable: C drive 210G. 
0	When I tried the machine at the pick-up point, I pressed the power button several times when I turned it on for the first time. After waiting a long time, I suddenly started it on my own. I don’t know why. No modem, although there are not many opportunities to use it, it is easy to use occasionally when faxing is needed; Y430 has a mouse, this one actually saves the mouse 
1	"Just as the Yellow River is the birthplace of the Chinese nation, the Mississippi River in the United States is a melting pot of American spirit. Mark &#183; Twain portrays the origins of American spirit through the book ""The Wandering Huck"": the author portrays the dreamlike scenery of the Mississippi River in plain language, and sings the growth of the man with humor and even acrimony. And the origins of freedom, dream and adventurous spirit and even cowboy style. Therefore, although it is called children's literature, it is regarded as the best literary work in American history. I've read it when I was young, and I dare to take a look at the young men who lack manhood today. "
0	First of all, I was misled by Ctrip and thought it was a four-star hotel. I didn't expect it to be a non-star (or 2-star) room among the four stars. If you indicate in advance, you will definitely not book this room. Later, it was found that the pillowcase was moldy. After complaining, the waiter said that it was not moldy, but it was not cleaned!!!!!! It was unreasonable! But it was changed. Then there is a large yellow spot on the inner side of the towel? Disgusting! Actually want to collect the next morning 
0	A super bad book, I can’t read it after I bought a full set, and Dangdang has overblown it and misleads consumers. 
1	The price is a bit expensive, buy it for a friend, if the friend is happy, go online, do not do 3D, CAD, do not require speed, can go online, just play QQ, QQ chat, play small games, it is enough. 
1	Instead of a new group of fat dogs’ diary messages~I bought 2 books in the diary~ I like it very much~ hee hee` 
1	I read the online reviews extensively, and finally chose this hotel. The business sea view standard room on the 3rd floor is indeed first-class, but the sound insulation effect is a little bit worse. I was planning to choose the sea and sky. , The room is looking at the sea sideways. I heard that the front desk was a guest of the Association, and it was a bit cold. The big-eyed lobby manager is really good! 
1	"I bought it with the book ""Appreciation and Practice of Chinese Paper-cutting Art"", and just received it today. The family is quite satisfied with these two books. The works in the book are very beautiful and have high appreciation and collection value. Seeing that some people think this book is not suitable for beginners, I don't think so. Paper-cutting is an art that requires great care and patience. If you just want to cut and play with yourself, or cut some simple things such as flowers, animals, and little people for children, this book is really not suitable; but if you are a fan of paper-cutting art, then the patterns of the works provided in the book There is still great reference value. "
1	I like the white color. The running speed is not bad. I have selected many machines of the same brand, and I finally fancy this upgraded version of EEE PC. As long as you don't play professional games, this netbook should be enough to meet your daily computer needs. If the price can be discounted, it will be more valuable! 
1	By telling my son every school bus story, I found that I was deeply attracted, and a lot of knowledge is not even known to me. The 3-year-old son clamored for me to tell the magic school bus every day. He now knows that there is a solar system. What kinds of dinosaurs are there, how bees collect honey, what organs in the human body do and how they work, etc., this is far more interesting than boring science books, the most important thing is that children are impressed, which is amazing enough Yes. I am also going to buy the second and third series. A great set of books, recommended! 
0	The only shortcoming, for people like me who are not very proficient in computers, is that it has no XP system installed! 
1	Booked a standard room, but upgraded to an executive room for free, which is good. The hotel has a good environment and good service. However, the parking lot at the entrance of the hotel has to be charged. It feels very bad. I encountered this situation for the first time. I hope that next time I go, guests staying in the hotel can be free. Not because of 20 yuan, but because you are five-star. The hotel should naturally have a real five-star service.

0	The keyboard function keys seem to be tilted up. Observe carefully, it seems that Toshiba's are like this. Please pay attention when you look at it. 
1	As a mother, I personally like this book, but I still wonder if it is suitable for children. This book looks at our lives from a child's perspective and tells it in a humorous tone. It is really interesting and thought-provoking. For me, who often feel tired from working overtime, I recently used this book as a good product for mental relaxation and pleasure. I read a paragraph before going to bed and couldn’t help but chuckle. At the same time, I didn’t have to deliberately reflect on it: I am like Nicholas. In general, there are also many ridiculous self-contradictions. This book seems to be of greater educational significance for adults, ha ha~~ 
0	The introduction of the hotel does not match the actual situation, does not meet the 3-star standard, the room is not tight, and a credit card guarantee is required. After arriving at the scene, the guests were dissatisfied. In the end, they chose rather the hotel to deduct the room fee, and also chose other hotels in Kashgar, that is, the Central West Asia International Hotel, which was not recommended by Ctrip. The price is similar, but it is a four-star standard. . Moreover, the communication between Ctrip and the hotel is not doing well. It is obvious that the introduction of the hotel is quite different from the actual situation, and the price is 30% higher than the price of the local travel agency, but the hotel still deducts all the rooms we booked. Fee, I also have to consider whether to continue to use Ctrip as my choice. 
1	I finished reading this book from my friend first. It feels good. Now the child is just over one year old. Considering that he might use it in the future, I bought it and continued studying for later use. This book is written in a very clear way. The skills are easy to use and the language is very appropriate. The author wrote about how to increase the affection with children, how to share feelings with children, how to give children effective praise and a series of similar topics. These are not only useful for children, but also very useful for anyone in contact with children. 
1	"I missed this book many times, and finally I bought it on the recommendation of a friend. Fortunately, I did not miss it all the time. When I was young, I liked watching Swedish people the most. Lindgren's works, such as ""Carlsson on the Roof"" and ""Naughty Bag Emil"", accompanied me through an unforgettable childhood. Until now, whenever I see a picture of that style, it will touch the most warm memory in my heart. Old man Pai and Feifei are the same story. Humorous and warm, my daughter is three years old and she likes it very much. She often asks me to look at the angry bull and Feifei cockfighting. I believe this will also become a warm childhood impression of my daughter. "
0	I bought a book worth more than 600 yuan for this order and received the goods soon, but my five sets of baby bears were not shipped at all, and they were missed. Two weeks have passed and I haven't dealt with it yet. Disappointed! 
1	"Compared with the previous two ""Summer of the Birds"" and ""The Box of Sprites"", the translation is a bit unaccustomed, maybe it is still preconceived. I still like ""The Box of Sprites"" the most (ah~ I am also put in the box Inside). Although there have always been some difficult and obscure theories, this time I have more knowledge involved. Fortunately, I majored in psychology and I can understand Freud's theory a little bit. It may be because it is a skeleton rather than a ghost, so I didn't have a good time to read this time. I heard that ""The Threshold of the Iron Rat"" was released in April. I don't know when it will be available. I am looking forward to it, and I will continue to chase it. "
1	The same guest came to Hong Kong for the second time, and I used Ctrip to book a hotel for him for the second time. I have looked for many other hotels in Hong Kong, and this one is the most cost-effective. But when I passed by myself, I found that after coming out of the subway, I could see the big PANDA of the hotel from a distance, but it took a long time to ask a lot of people to enter the hotel!! The guest said he went out to buy something at night, but couldn’t find the direction. The taxi that didn’t arrive for five minutes came back!! That kind of road construction, if you are not very familiar with the road, is indeed very confusing... But in general, the customer said that he will still do it next time Staying here, although it is far from the city, it is relatively quiet and there is no noise in the city. Perhaps this is why they are cheap. Everyone has their own ideas. It is recommended to build more points to the hotel sign board after the subway comes out Better! Supplementary review July 2, 2008: Because of the traffic problem, I planned to give 4.0, how habitually hooked 5.0... 
0	I bought it with a lot of interest. I bought it with a rough copy and the layout is very good. My sister said to look at it. If it is good, I will also buy one. But I really watched it, it's really not very good. I just turned two pages of English words in Chinese and I didn't want to force myself. What I want to say is that practicing English vocabulary will definitely not be effective by relying on this book. Other good methods are much better than this. 
1	The service of Heqing Hotel in Weihai is particularly attentive and very user-friendly. I have stayed in many hotels, but there has never been a considerate and thoughtful service like Heqing Hotel in Weihai. 
0	The content is a bit hollow, the writing is babbled, somewhat deluded, and quite different from the practicality he advertised. 
0	The bearing that connects the screen to the mainframe feels so fragile, so I don't dare to open and close it. Maybe I am used to using IBM before. I always feel that the plastic shell and bearing of this machine are so fragile. 
1	"A friend said, ""The house is a bit over-decorated now. It doesn’t look like a house anymore. It looks like a luxurious pollution source."" We stayed in the house for too long. Many people advocated that we ""get out of the house and breathe in nature."" ""Air"" is said to be lightweight and difficult to do. Modern society dictates. We can only stay in the house for a long time, whether it is a warm home or a busy office. This book is very good, directly? Don't let the house murder your health?, we can't go out, then we can guarantee that it is safe to stay in the house. The house is being renovated. Thank you Dangdang! "
1	1: Strong performance. 2: There is no heat dissipation problem mentioned above, the temperature is very low, slightly warm. 3: The optical drive is very good, no noise. The screen is nice and perfect. 4 The driver is easy to find and easy to install. 5: More usb ports. 6: High cost performance. 7: Although not beautiful but atmospheric 
0	The included recovery CD is gone, only the power adapter and a CD drive tray. In fact, the computers are all sold, so you can send a set of recovery CDs. There is also the memory is too small, running VISTA is a bit slow, you have to add memory yourself. The hard drive is also slightly smaller. 
0	I bought it after reading the reviews, and I found that it is not so good. I don't like this style very much. My son doesn't like to read it. Maybe girls will like this kind of book? 
1	Nice hotel, the rooms are clean and quiet (15th floor). The customer treats it in the private room of the hotel and it tastes good. The Chinese breakfast is slightly insufficient, there is nothing to choose from, and the taste is okay. 
0	She is a rare and successful media person. Why must she write 15 words? For this book, there is nothing to write about? ? 
0	Basically useless and thin beyond imagination. Maybe that kid taught so much? Maybe more suitable for children under 3 years old? I don't understand 
0	It feels so-so. If you are traveling, it is far from the downtown area, which is a bit inconvenient. It's the floor instead of the carpet that I like. Broadband requires an extra charge, but digital TV can make up for it. The guest room is very simple, the furniture is a bit small, it feels not atmospheric enough, the funny thing is that there is no socket in the bathroom. . . . The room near the road is very noisy, although it has double windows, it is not quiet enough. Supplementary review May 4, 2007: The above review is a review of other hotels, it is wrong~~~~~~~~~ Add: The location is in the downtown area, it is very convenient to go shopping, the room is not only the floor, Others have been there, broadband charges are uncomfortable, breakfast is average, but the taste of fish balls is OK 
0	Why leave a small room reserved for Ctrip, the waiter is not very good. 
0	There is nothing new in this book from structure to plot to text. It is a typical online literature. If the requirements for novels are not high, it is purely for the sake of understanding, maybe it can be done 
1	Generally speaking, the hotel’s service facilities and the attitude of the service staff are quite good, but the provision of free broadband as mentioned when booking the hotel is not available. Therefore, the laptop specially brought is useless. I wanted to pay with a credit card when I checked out, but I was told that I could not swipe the card on the day. It is recommended that the information in this area needs to be more accurate. 
0	I felt very good when I stayed in 2006, and the service and hardware were good. So this time I took my parents and relatives to stay here, and highly recommended this hotel that once felt very good. But this time the feeling is completely different. It can be said that I am disappointed and faceless. 1. When I checked in on the same day, I checked in at around 11 o'clock as stated on the reservation form (4 rooms were booked in total). The lady at the front desk told me that there was only one clean room, two dirty rooms had not been cleaned, and the other No time. I was very upset at that time. I had already confirmed it before, and I had booked it through Ctrip. I also confirmed the order. I received a reconfirmation call from Ctrip just 5 minutes before I checked in. It told me that there is no room. Said that the room may not be able to exit until 12:00. Halo, what kind of hotel is this! After some disputes, four rooms were finally booked. What a hard work! 2. One of them had to change the room. The waiters on the upstairs and downstairs had inconsistent statements, and the price difference between the room was changed for a long time. Later, because they were in a hurry to go out to play, it was not in their dispute. The training of waiters really should be strengthened! 3. For breakfast the next morning, because there is only one breakfast in each room, the child needs to add breakfast, and encounters the same problem the day before. Different waiters have different explanations. Originally, I called and consulted three children before going downstairs to dine. Two 1.4 meters and one 1 meter discount would cost 50 yuan. However, when dining in the restaurant, the two 1.4 meters cost the full price and the 1 meter half price. It's very unhappy. Forget it after the dispute, pay at the original price, too lazy to engage with the hotel, tossing that I am not in a beautiful mood. 4. The most annoying thing is this. I was woken up by heat in a four-star hotel at around 5 in the morning. The premise is that my air conditioner was turned on at 22 degrees and I would be woken up by the heat. My LG was sweating all over my bare arms. The same happened in the room where relatives lived. Turning off the air conditioner to save energy is so irritating. I called the housekeeping center, and it turned out that the main station answered the phone, saying that the water temperature had gone up and the air conditioner was not turned off. Then I asked him to ask the manager on duty to explain the air conditioner, but after 10 minutes, I randomly found a waiter to come and try I. After I complained on the phone, I turned on the central air conditioner again. What hotel, is it worthy of his shining four stars? How much energy can be saved by turning off central air conditioning? I really don’t know how the hotel considers it. Is it important for guests to save a little energy cost? Later, I went downstairs and negotiated with the hotel manager for a long time, but there was no result and the problem was not solved. I was very upset. In the end, I had to pack my things and go through the check-out procedures. Who calls us a vulnerable group? At the checkout, the hotel manager came over and explained that the air conditioner was not turned off, but the water temperature was up, so the temperature was high, and then discounted the price of the two rooms without air conditioner that we complained about. At this time, I was not in the mood to be wordy with the hotel, so I quickly settled and left, so that my beautiful mood of traveling should not be affected again. May I ask if the hotel has a clear conscience and does not turn off the air conditioner, then why do you come to give my room a discount? Additional comments on August 11, 2008: 5. The shower head in the bathroom is not working well. I barely rushed down after a long time of tossing. I originally wanted to change rooms, but LG said that the child is asleep, so don’t toss it (the child is in relatives). Shower in the room). Hotel feedback August 15, 2008: Dear guests, hello! First of all, I sincerely apologize to you. We did not serve you well during your stay at our hotel. It is our work mistakes and our usual training. Your criticism is to help us improve, and I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you! We will definitely accept your comments and hope that we can provide you with better service next time you come. I wish you and your family good health and success in your work! 
1	It's really good! The location is better, the sea view room is facing the trestle bridge and Xiaoqingdao, you can enjoy the pleasant sea view without leaving the door or crowding in the tourist crowd; the breakfast is rich and the environment is good, and the price is relatively high; the coffee bar on the first floor The simple meals are not high in price, taste better, and have plenty of portions (especially sandwiches and hot dogs). It is a good choice for residents and non-resident tourists to solve a simple meal or as a snack; the snacks in the hotel corridor are more popular and varieties There are many, high-quality, and timely additions, which are loved by children; that is, the bed is slightly smaller (referring to if you bring a child to sleep). In short, the overall feeling is good, it is recommended to stay. 
0	Feeling fooled. . . . I heard it's hot on TV. , I don’t know anything in the book, but the story is taken from the reader. . . Boring. 
0	The hotel is relatively old, and the sea view room is also very general. The slippers of the hotel are said to be not disposable, but it is not stated on the package, and you will need to charge 10 yuan per pair! I did not find this slippers compared with other five-star hotels What’s the most significant difference! I’m really sorry to charge for the slippers for such a low cost-effective room rate! So you have to be prepared that the slippers can’t get wet and dirty during your stay, which means charging! Maybe the hotel will justly give you environmental reasons ! I won’t live again next time, I really don’t see any particularly comfortable place! You can try Haiyue Jianguo again! Anyway, the sea view room of this hotel is not interesting! And the room is quite average! The service is nothing to be praised Yes! It's definitely not even comparable to the Zunhua Ramada in Tai'an, although Tai'an is a small place! 
1	The Panglin Hotel is too busy for parking, and the room has a peculiar smell, especially after being separated from Hilton. 
0	"The worst listed five-star hotel I have ever stayed in!!! The executive superior river view room booked faces the Fuchun River, but there is a middle school between the hotel and the river. There are many old residential areas and a hospital around the hotel, which feels a bit messy. Generally speaking, it is so-so. The only feature is that the mirror in the bathroom is heated and user-friendly. It is more convenient to have maps and magazines introducing local attractions in the room. But the service is very unsatisfactory! 1. The hotel's parking lot management is very good Confusion, when I went there happened to be May Day. There are many local marriages, but I have never heard of a five-star hotel that does not even have a reserved parking space for basic guests because of weddings, but this hotel is! It was the same for two days on the 2nd, which made me wait for half an hour for a parking space! 2. Because of the same reason as the wedding charter, the hotel did not provide catering services except ROOM SERVICE (very kindly told me that even ROOM SERVICE You have to wait for a long time!), you have to go outside to eat! Imagine how the tourists feel if they come back from a tired day and can’t eat? 3. A lot of facilities in the hotel are not available, and fitness/swimming/beauty are all stopped, which makes people totally unable to use it. I understand, and I don’t give guests a reasonable explanation! 4. There is a problem with the hotel’s air-conditioning system. There is no air-conditioning in the room but only cold air. After repairing it for a long time, it broke again in the middle of the night, which is very depressing. 5. The safe and storage in the room The hotlinks were damaged and could not be repaired, and it felt unsafe. 6. After talking to the front desk about the above questions, the lady said that she would contact the manager immediately to give an answer, and then she fell to the sea, which felt completely perfunctory! Until I left the hotel Nothing to say! 7. Basically all the service staff did not smile. The above is my real feeling after staying in the hotel for two days on May Day. I can understand that the service quality of the festival has decreased slightly, but the drop is so powerful. ""Really learned! "
0	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. There was a mad woman who smashed the door at around six o'clock in the morning, and the security of the hotel was indifferent. I went to complain and said that I knocked on the wrong door. The hotel's monitoring is useless, and I will never live again. The quality of service absolutely needs to be improved, and it is not worthy of the four-star card. 
1	The screen LED is very bright, the keyboard needs to adapt, the battery has not tested how long it can last. Lightweight and easy to carry. 
1	My son doesn’t like to read extracurricular books! This is an extracurricular book that Weiyi wants, so I bought it! I watched it all day and laughed! It’s not funny because it is funny. The book is very informative and interesting As an adult, I sometimes want to read a book in one go, and I feel that I have gained something! It can be seen that the knowledge is not the ordinary and superficial kind. The most important book tells the children in the form of adventures. The way to deal with the crisis! It may be very practical! It is a good set of books! It is worth reading! It is also worth collecting. Anyway, it is much more valuable than the so-called masterpieces of most domestic publishing houses. 
0	The delivery time was too long, it took 6 days from the order to my hands. Doesn’t it mean free shipping? Why did you charge me 8 yuan. 
1	1. The most notable advantage is the long battery life; 2. The configuration is relatively complete: wireless, Bluetooth, and camera are necessary; 3. The workmanship is good, and the paint is more beautiful; 4. It is small and portable, just a magazine The size is enough to fit a normal schoolbag; five, the brand is okay, the information on the Internet is relatively complete; six, under normal circumstances, the sound of the hard disk and the fan is not too loud. 
0	This is the worst hotel I booked with Ctrip. It is recommended to cancel the cooperation with this hotel. 
0	This hotel is suspected of deception: ctrip shows that the executive room has free internet access, but it is not the case. It is free only when you go to the executive lounge. The internet access in the room is charged at 2 yuan per minute, and if you go to the executive lounge, you must You can activate your account online first in the room. In other words, you have to spend at least two yuan to get online, and you are no longer in the room. This is not a deception. If I knew that, I wouldn't settle here for more than 1,400 room rates. Living there is no better than here. I just want to go online. Other services are really average. It is far away from the city and it is very inconvenient to travel. There are few facilities around, there are more hotels in the city at the same price, and I will not live next time, and the breakfast is really average. The check-in speed is slow, and if a foreigner asks a question, I just let go of the check-in with me and go to take care of others. This makes people feel very bad. Check out is also a drag. 
1	The author's idea is very good, mainly based on the internal situation of a company to determine the stock situation. The operation is more difficult, the author admits, so he said let the fund manager do the things in the book. The inspiration for me is not about buying stocks, but also how to do business and how to train employees; I think students who have just graduated and are looking for a job should look at what kind of business you should work for; if you will be a boss in the future, you should also look , How to treat employees, how to treat enterprises and so on. As a stock book, I think it should be Samsung; but it gave me other inspirations, so I added a star. 
1	I feel very comfortable living here and I am in a good mood. Any problems can be solved in a timely manner. Both the assistant manager and the waiter in the lobby are very professional and the service standard is first-rate. The breakfast is very rich, and the revolving restaurant can see Xuanwu Lake. 
0	Jingdong’s delivery speed is nothing to say, but Yuantong is really slow! It is recommended not to use Yuantong in the future! 
1	The hotel's transportation is not very convenient, the elevator is particularly slow, and the rest are home-like features. 
1	The price/performance ratio is really good, the screen is very beautiful, I closed my eyes and tore the film, ha ha. I gave the mouse and the screen wiper. I didn’t know there was a little surprise when I bought it. The packaging is thick. 
1	I have lived here in Fuzhou since 2001. This time I feel that the room is a little bit better and the hot spring water is still available. Overall very satisfied. Breakfast is simpler. 
1	"The author's analysis of the ""rough surface"" and ""smooth inside"" of some movies can be said to be a trivial one, providing a clear perspective for understanding those movies that seem to touch reality but make people feel something is wrong. This angle may be secretive to the director, or it may be unconscious. Regardless of whether it is evasive or unconscious, this kind of submission to the status quo is harmful to art sincerity, or what they do has nothing to do with art. "
1	In this society, people are becoming more and more selfish, putting their own interests first, and often revealing their own behavior in this ugly communication process. . . Correspondingly, to stand firm in this society is inseparable from personal conduct. It’s not bad for anyone to make friends. We don’t care about others’ accomplishments and qualities, if we can’t do it ourselves, then You are not qualified to judge others, that is to say you, Obasan who stepped on people’s feet on the bus and refused to open his mouth to apologize~ This book is actually not suitable for you, because people who read this book often already have good Character~~ 
0	The first stay and the last stay! Reason 4: 1. The price of Ctrip's online buffet breakfast is 20 yuan, and the actual charge is 38 yuan. The hotel explained that the online price has not been updated. 2. The sound insulation effect is very poor. The 5th floor of the hotel is a KTV. I live on the 10th floor and can hear singing at night; 3. The toilet is poor. The first room is blocked because the toilet is changed to another room, but the result is still broken , The engineer repaired until nearly 12 o'clock, it was done, I really can't imagine this kind of hotel will happen; 4. The service attitude is poor, giving people a cold feeling. In short, this is the worst hotel I feel! 
0	The room is too dirty and there is no hot water. The attendant on this building said that the boiler is broken and it cannot be repaired. I asked to change the room. Since I answered that there is no hot water in all three floors, it is obviously a lie! I also said that there is no room available. I said Then I can't move, so I tell those two self-confident

The machine and the price are good. The machine and the price are good. The machine and the price are good. The machine and the price are good. 
0	The camera is CMOS photosensitive, the effect is too bad in the dark, it can be accepted during the day. The buttons on the touch screen are a bit hard and need improvement. 
1	Yesterday, I placed an order on JD.com and bought this computer! I took it back home this morning, the appearance is very beautiful, the workmanship is also very fine! Especially the screen is really dazzling! (To be honest, I bought it for the reputation of ViewSonic, even though he made a netbook for the first time.) I can't comment on the intrinsic quality now. Let's talk about it after a while! I have been using it for more than 5 hours now, and it doesn't feel very hot. I personally think that the price is right. As for the introduction of the 4600 six-cell battery, it can only be used for 3 hours. I don’t understand. Is it because ViewSonic is polite or because it consumes a lot of power? I won’t know until I use it. 
0	Very annoying, I feel fooled, the cover is sealed with plastic paper, there are many writers, celebrity names, and many comments on it. I thought it would look good, so I can’t wait to open it, but~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ This book can only be said to be average!!! It does not deserve to be recommended by so many writers and celebrities!! However, the quality of the book is good, the paper is good, and the printing is OK. The cover feels comfortable to the touch. But. The content is not good, and I don’t like the paper no matter how good it is!!!! 
1	I just got it the day before yesterday, the price is very high, the keyboard is always comfortable to use, the heat dissipation effect is good, the XP speed is fast, and the appearance is very beautiful 
1	After reading it for a while, it feels like-the book of heaven, classical literature and modern literary thought are the deep sea, and communication is the ocean wave, the deep undercurrent, the turbulence on the surface... the book of heaven, how can I understand... . 
0	I bought it after reading many good reviews, but I was so disappointed that I threw it on the floor after reading it. Angry. I didn't see what was good, whether it was the language or the story. 
0	It seems more moldy. 1. Place an order on June 14th, pay on the 16th, and can't wait for Shanghai Zhongtong to pick it up on the 25th. Delivery is nearly 10 days! 2. I don't know whether it is a driver problem or a machine problem. Once the touchpad is opened, it will always right-click. The same applies to LINUX and XP. You can only use the mouse now. 3. The system is not XP. 
1	This is my first notebook, so the concept of good or bad is not clear. Currently playing Devil May Cry 4 and Prince of Persia 4 are all OK, and it’s easy to install XP. I bought the D version (Depth XP-SP3 7.0) to install, and the drivers are all available. ! 
1	"""The most precious thing in the thousands of years of human history is not the dazzling science and technology, the classic works of the vast masters, or the speeches of politicians, but the realization of the taming of the rulers and the realization of keeping them locked in. The dream in the cage. Because only by taming them and locking them up, will they not be harmful. I am standing in the cage and talking to you now."" ------ Jr. Bush "
1	Considering the location, star rating, price, environment and facilities, this hotel is quite good. If there are no other factors, I will stay again next time. In order to make your hotel a healthy development, I would like to remind you: 1. Not professional enough, no professional smile. 2. The room (1117) has a problem with the faucet and the water. Does anyone report for repair and management? This involves resources, cost, reputation and service. 3. The noise of running water at night when the air is adjusted (the decibel may not be less than 50), it may affect the rest of many guests. I hope that it will be changed next time. 
1	The mirror effect is good and the sound is quite small. I especially like the grille in front of the screen, and my colleagues bought one after seeing it! 
0	1. Installing the system is super troublesome. In order to save a few dollars in cost, when the DOS system installed by Jingdong was converted to an XP system, the blue screen occurred several times. 2. The button on the left of the machine that Jingdong sent to me was broken. When I clicked it, there was no response at all .General heat dissipation. 
0	The media is hyping too much. I usually don't have time to watch TV. I bought a book in admiration and respectfully read it, only to find that it is actually so-so. 
1	Highlight cost performance. . very good. . I started to be a little worried about the CPU, and found that the performance was very good with 2G memory, at least it was very good to run XP. Very big hard drive, and I like the machine very much. 
1	I chose this hotel after reading reviews, and it did not disappoint. Every hotel staff serves the guests sincerely, which is second to none in China. For example, we are looking for a supermarket in a hotel. Instead of telling you where you are with a finger, they will show you the way. The air conditioner is a bit cold when dining in the restaurant of the hotel. I took out the shawl, but the waiter delivered it immediately A bowl of ginger soup, blowing the sea breeze a bit cold, they found out when they went to the restaurant for breakfast, and delivered cold granules and ginger soup. We are very moved. The design and facilities of the hotel rooms are very good, and small gifts are carefully prepared every day. It is a rare and generous hotel. The only thing that I think needs to be improved is the training of hotel staff to understand the distinctive scenic spots and restaurants in Qingdao (of course this is difficult for any other hotel to do), because there is really nothing else to suggest :) Additional comments August 1, 2008: I suggest you not to go to Qingdao Underwater World, the Polar World very close to the Sea View Garden is very fun, and I will be very disappointed if I have been to the polar region and then go to the seabed:) 
1	I booked the superior lady's room (twin bed), the room was clean and tidy, and the service was okay. The variety of breakfast is a bit small, but the taste is okay. Check out is fast. In general, my colleagues and I lived quite satisfied. 
1	The environment is very good and the location is good. Guests live here every time. It should be quite satisfactory. 
0	The heat dissipation is not good, the heat dissipation of the power supply is even worse, and the appearance is too ugly, it is a bit... 
1	The overall feeling is pretty good, and it will definitely not affect the mood of traveling. I live on the first floor of the small building at the back. The environment is good, the garden is the same, the swimming pool is open-air, and you can see people cleaning it all the time. If the balcony windows are not closed at night, the front desk will call the room to remind guests to pay attention to safety. Supplementary comments September 20, 2007: In addition, when we go there, we will be picked up in advance. When we return, because there are elderly people, we contacted the housekeeping department and arranged a car to take us to the airport. The downside is that the room facilities are average and the breakfast is very vegetarian. 
0	There is no shortage of goods. What is lacking is JD.com. What is the postal logistics? It is delivered by donkey. It was delivered in 5 days. Moreover, there is no price protection for the installment. The direct payment is more than 220 yuan, and the customer service attitude is obviously not It was good before. 
1	Very quiet, much quieter than the original Samsung notebook I bought 5 years ago. I took it out on a trip this time. I drove it for a long time, watching movies, listening to music, and reading books. . . Even if the vent is blocked, the machine is not overheated, and it feels warm. It’s very convenient to take with you when you go out, you can put all the bags in 
0	The payment was successful on May 8th. Dangdang.com showed that it will be shipped on May 10th, but so far I haven’t seen the goods or received any notice. Jane doesn’t know how to say it! ! ! 
0	"I rated 3 hearts not because of Dangdang service or poor book quality, but because of the content of the book that makes people unable to give high marks. This kind of book is not suitable to be bought for close reading, it can only be read as a magazine. And the author himself is not high-level—whether it is narrative or experience. Let’s talk about the author’s age. I think I’m really embarrassed to write this kind of articles. I don’t discriminate against this age or anything, but think that many times a person’s life should not be too early to make a conclusion. , Maybe when you are 40 years old, you will think that what you think at 30 is wrong~ I’m wondering why you’re on the “ranking version”. And I won't mention the right and wrong of the concept for the time being. Many of the concepts in the author's own book are self-contradictory, and many of the content is just an understanding of something. It is too limited to mention ""people around me"" at every turn. There really shouldn't be such a book to mislead others, and readers don't need to buy such a book to waste time. However, the preface written by others is worthy of consideration, and the overtones and overtones can make people smile~~~~~~ "
1	This book has brought me a different kind of workplace novel, and it also allowed me to learn a little experience. It is the closest to life. It is what happens in our lives. It is not as exaggerated as some novels. This book is very simple. , Very warm, very interesting, and can bring me a happy enjoyment, watching Mia’s transformation, but she always insists on herself, choosing what suits herself is what she wants, not being completely influenced by the environment, being happy Workplace people 
1	"It's been a long time since I read a book that I can't put it down. Although ""The Straw House"" is a book of children's literature, the story of ""The Straw House"" is about every living life. The childlike story brought me back to my childhood memories, back to them, to play together and live life. This book is suitable for the bridge between children and adults. Although life is so ordinary, beautiful places are everywhere. Let us learn to find beauty in life and give love! "
1	The author proposes a way of working and living. As a veteran of the consulting industry, he can not only put forward ideas, but also put forward specific steps. What he shows is a natural life attitude, a combination of labor and labor, and relaxation. A way of life. The views put forward by the author introduced the optimistic lifestyles of Europeans and Americans, combined with the current social conditions and living environment in Japan, and proposed a practical life course. In fact, these views are also applicable to Chinese who are now following in the footsteps of Japan. You will be happy if you can play. 
1	"I just opened the ""Summer Calendar Insurance"" seriously, and after reading it, my eyes are dim. In order to get the pony and gun he dreamed of, the little boy desperately wanted to catch the monkey and get the bonus, but after his dream came true, he changed his mind-for his sister, the cute boy gave up all the bonus. Give it to mother to heal my sister's legs. When the younger sister returned from the operation, the older brother took the little sister's little hand and ran between the mountains and rivers, tears burst into his eyes. Love runs through, love for small animals, strong love between family members...love, always around you! Highly recommend again! "
0	It’s really unbelievable. I stayed at the hotel again a week later or I was given room 1017 (single room) the last time I stayed. Because the room was close to the air duct control system inside the hotel, the noise was too loud. I strongly requested to change the room the next day. The hotel agreed to my request and was able to sleep peacefully that night. 
0	The order I placed on November 9th, but there is still no news, and the homepage is not a promotion of 6.8% off, but there are actually more than 6.8% on sale, the telephone consultation answer only According to the price of the shopping cart, Dangdang's service really needs to be improved. Don't think that it will not be enterprising when it becomes bigger. 
0	I have some doubts about the scientific nature of the content in the book, and some of the acupuncture points written in the book are not easy to find, so I personally think that the practicality is poor. 
0	Attracted by the name, misled by other people’s comments, I bought it back, and I don’t know what’s funny. It’s a classified vocabulary book with illustrations that are not salty or light. I don’t know where it reflects that it can make you remember more easily. Feeling fooled! ! ! 
0	1. If there is no drive, you have to drive yourself. 2. The screen is not mainstream, this one is 14-inch, 16:9, it looks a bit smaller 3. The keyboard does not feel very good, it is the kind that is easy to get dirty 
1	The room is very clean, you can see the three towers when you open the window, hehe, even the tickets are saved. It is very convenient to drive to Canghai Golf in five minutes. The fly in the ointment is that my friend left the phone on the bed when I went out (very sure, sure). After leaving Dali for half an hour and remembering it, I quickly called. I didn't expect the phone to be hung up and turned off after calling. When I called the hotel, the reception desk and the waiter respectively told me that I didn't see it. 
1	Very good location, living in a deluxe sea view room, you can see the trestle bridge and sea view by opening the window. I remember that I lived a long time ago, but it has been renovated now. Generally satisfied, will live in the future 
0	It looks like an apartment! It's an apartment! The lobby feels like an apartment, and the rooms are also very apartments. There is a kitchen and related equipment. In fact, you have no chance to use it, because you can't bring tableware with you! 
1	High cost performance, mainstream configuration. I think it will work for a few years. The package is good, and there is a Logitech mouse. Two drive disks save trouble. 
1	Because children are afraid of the sound of firecrackers, we have the habit of spending the night in the hotel every year on New Year’s Eve and fourth night 
0	"The weight is too heavy and the screen frame is too wide. The keyboard has no uppercase and lowercase indicators, which is troublesome. The original self-starting ""Bluetooth Control Panel"" can be displayed in upper and lower case on the screen if it is kept. But if you delete it from the automatic startup item, that is, if you don't start it randomly, you don't know how to distinguish between case. "
1	It is very close to the North Railway Station and the long-distance passenger terminal, and the rooms are very clean, but the price without breakfast is relatively uncompetitive. 
1	Staying in a suite in the Executive Building for three days in late April is generally satisfactory, but there are still the following opinions: 1. Maybe the corridors and kitchens are a bit musty after the longer renovation, and the kitchen equipment has been severely yellowed for a long time. 2. The elevators and residents There are only two sharing machines. Sometimes it takes a long time to wait. 3. From the elevator to the front desk, it is a little inconvenient to go through a small staircase of about six steps. 4. It is fairly convenient to live. The opposite is Jusco. 5. If you can provide simple pots , I want to be more in line with the definition of Ang's equipment. Hotel Feedback May 16, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay at the MasterCard Hotel and giving the hotel valuable suggestions. The hotel currently provides simple kitchen utensils. Due to the limited quantity, generally free pots and tableware are provided for guests to use when they need them. Hope you choose to stay at the Master Hotel again. 
0	The door is too wide, and you will be bitten by mosquitoes at night. There is a peculiar smell at night, and it is damp and wet. Like other people's ratings, it is the worst one I have ever visited. 
1	It is indeed brand new and unopened, the hard drive only passes power twice (required to install the system), the battery has not been charged, the screen has no bright spots~~~ it is perfect 
0	This Home Inn is too small, the room is very small and uncomfortable 
1	One day, we will be accustomed to the passing of time and the disappearing past. No matter who we are with, in what way...how does a drowning person know which drop of water killed him. . I was 21 years old that day, in the golden age of my life. I have a lot of hopes. I want to love, I want to eat, and I want to turn into the half-bright and half-dark clouds in the sky in an instant. Among thousands of people, I meet the people you meet. In thousands of years, in the boundless wilderness of time, No early, no late, just caught up 
1	For this stay, because I registered with Hong Kong and Macau ID card, the arranged floor was much higher. Ha ha. It's really a big difference. And the room is very new, it seems to have been remodeled. The bellman has a good attitude. Rich afternoon tea styles. I also gave a 50 yuan voucher for check-in, so the room price is very cost-effective. If you come back in the afternoon, you will consider staying again. 
1	It's okay. The standard room I stayed at was RMB 368. The bathroom was large and the facilities were quite complete. Some water heaters were available. Although the bed was not a big bed, it was just right and soft and hard. I had a good night's sleep. However, it is normal for a massage lady to make harassment calls. 
0	The mirror surface is easy to leave fingerprints, and there are always problems when powering on after hibernation. It may be a backup problem. 
0	The price/performance ratio is too poor. The room rate in a small county is higher than that of similar hotels in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. 
0	Very disappointed in a hotel. The facilities are better than Zibo Hotel and other hotels, but the smoke smell of the room is very heavy. This is still a non-smoking room. Forget these, I didn’t expect much from Zibo hotels, but I didn’t expect it to be there. To make matters worse, I booked a car to a hotel in Jinan. The concierge told me that it was 280 yuan. I confirmed the reservation and stated that it was listed on my room account at checkout. I called again early the next morning to confirm. At 1 o’clock in the checkout, the lady at the front desk said that she had not received the reservation, she was very arrogant and rude, and asked me to settle the room fee first, and then the concierge brought a receipt and asked me to sign the price not 280 yuan, but 280 yuan + 15% service charge. This is the first time I have encountered this situation. The hotel said that if I pay in cash, I still need to pay 280 yuan, and I don’t need to pay 15% service charge. I asked the deputy lobby manager to come over. She explained that the hotel has to pay a handling fee for credit card, so it charges 15 %, I think it is unreasonable, because 1) the concierge did not explain this when I ordered the car, 2) the bank's handling fee was 15%, and I have never heard of such a high bank card handling fee. Finally, under my strong protest, the deputy manager of the lobby said that he would still charge the credit card at 280 yuan. Only when I got on the reserved car, I found out that it was a taxi, not a hotel special car. Because the hotel does not have a fleet, it signed an agreement with 5 taxis. The taxi pays the hotel a management fee of several thousand yuan each year, and then the hotel guests decide to go. The car at Jinan Airport called them, to explain that the taxi I took was very good. From the point of view of price and service ratio, this hotel is not suitable, I will not stay again. 
1	Yes, it is very close to Dalian Port, just a few minutes walk. Tourists by boat are suitable for this hotel. The hanging four-star feels a bit more than the three-star, and a bit less than the four-star. But the price of the hotel is worthy of the guests. There are more than two hundred Home Inns in Dalian. I was very touched that our ship arrived in Dalian Bay at around four o'clock in the morning, and the car from the wharf was delivered to the railway station, and then we took a taxi to the hotel. The time was about six o'clock. I am very worried that the hotel will let us stay so early. I walked into the hotel anxiously. There was only one waiter at the front desk, with a very kind attitude, always gentle, and a warm smile. After confirming our reservation and having room available, we checked in. This way we can rest for an hour before heading out to discover the kingdom. This hour of rest is very important and effective. 
1	The price was 4499 when I bought it, which is more economical. After installing the XP system, the speed is very fast, and the driver disk installation is foolish and very good. The driver of version 1.0 is installed, and version 2.0 seems to be prepared for the Vista system. 
1	The rooms are small but very clean. It takes a long time to check in at check-in, and it takes a lot of time to check out. Generally satisfied 
1	The little girl at the front desk is very interesting. She often stays in and is familiar with her 
1	When I first entered Sofitel Ginza Hotel, I was warmly received by the lady at the front desk. She told me that all rooms booked through Ctrip can be upgraded for free, and I feel very warm. My room was arranged on a dedicated lady's floor. I have stayed in so many hotels. For the first time I heard that there is a dedicated lady's floor. There are many good-looking women’s magazines in the room, as well as cotton pads and bath salts. The most important thing is that the room is very high, the air is good, and the view is better. You can see all the buildings in Jinan, as well as Daming Lake and Quancheng Square. Glance. Next time you come to Jinan, you must still live here... 
0	The keyboard is a bit rough, you need to install the wireless network card manually, otherwise the wireless is restricted after restarting XP 
0	I went to the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee to do business. Because I was not very familiar with Guiyang, I booked a Wuyue hotel room in Guiyang through Ctrip. I checked into Wuyue Hotel on May 11 and left on May 26. The hotel gives me the feeling that the room is too old and the service is too bad. It is so much worse than the 4-star hotel I have stayed in before. It can't be considered a 4-star at all. The hotel room was too small and the breakfast was too poor (one day at breakfast, the mung bean porridge turned out to be sour. At first I thought it was a Guizhou specialty, but after eating a few more bites, I found that the food was definitely bad). depressed! ! ! The newspaper was originally published every night, but only 6 days out of the 16 days I stayed at the hotel! ! The most important thing is that the hotel pictures on Ctrip are completely different from the actual appearance and room pictures of Wuyue Hotel, and the difference is too much, too bad! ! ! I don't know how Ctrip investigated. The service at Wuyue Hotel is even worse! ! During the checkout, I had to say that I used a compressed towel for them, and wasted more than an hour with them. The result was nothing, and there was no sense of service and quality in a word! ! ! ! I lived for 16 days and spent 4800 yuan, how can I get you a 10 yuan thing? ? And it's useless things like compressed towels (they change bath towels every day) I haven't thought about it now! ! ! After I left Guiyang, I arrived in Xi'an. It was useless with Ctrip. It is really hard to believe the things on Ctrip! ! ! Honesty is the most precious wealth of a nation. Why are we now throwing away all such precious wealth? ? ? What are we left in the end? ? 
1	I got it in 1999. It’s okay. The most important thing is the high cost performance. How do I think the original system of my machine supports Bluetooth and 3G network! Is your support? 
0	I bought something on Dangdang a few times, and it feels not very good. There are always some minor problems in the service. I placed an order on the 19th, and I called on the 24th to still pick up the goods, and your website clearly stated that it was in accordance with the regulations. Delivery within 2_5 days. The record shows that it was not sent out until the 30th. What kind of service is this, terrible. Last time there was a problem with the item and I had to return it, I asked if I could return the item earlier, and the customer service staff answered no, only 5 (7) Processed within working days. I waited 2 weeks to call the customer service staff and then delayed for a few days to solve the problem. It feels that the regulations are made for customers, and the company staff does not matter, which makes people lack of trust. Customer service is a service attitude Very good, but who is boring and has nothing to look for customer service. I think most rooms have very low requirements, as long as you do what you promised, it is right. I don’t want you to do it perfectly.. Improve it well, otherwise you will have a few more In this world, I don’t know if Dangdang is available. 
1	Old five-star hotel, 358 yuan standard room, affordable price, but the room TV is too small, other good. 
0	The duty manager (female) on September 23 was amazing! I arrived at the hotel at 3:57 in the morning due to flight reasons. I booked the island at 8 o’clock (the earliest arrival time for Ctrip) and entered the hotel room with the permission of the waiter. At that time, I did not ask for an additional fee and charged me 500. deposit. At noon the duty manager (female) suddenly called my room and said that I had to pay another day’s fee. I argued for reasons and told her that your waiter should be obliged to inform her. If you say in advance, I agree, you It's not too much to collect! She even said that she couldn't tell you clearly and hung up my phone. Later, I asked the waiter of the day to call my room. After my questioning, he also admitted that it was his mistake and was willing to bear my loss. I immediately contacted the duty manager, but she actually said that this is what I handled and it has nothing to do with him, you must pay. I immediately asked to check out (at 9 o'clock at the time), and she actually said that you will also charge you for a day and a half of the room if you refund now. She also said that this is a hotel regulation, I said you showed it to me, and she actually answered me that it was confidential. I went downstairs and left the room. I asked for her name and told her that I want to complain to you. She actually said that I didn't need to tell you my name, I was the manager! Bull. Such a service attitude turned out to be the management staff, and one can imagine what kind of attitude her management staff will serve customers! Additional comment October 4, 2006: This hotel is really beyond words to describe. I still hope that you take care of your wallet so that you don’t know what's going on after being charged! The best way everyone is not to live, otherwise you won’t know what you are paying for! Please tell me more! 
1	The business room booked is small and old, but the furniture is very characteristic of the ancient capital. The breakfast is average, but it is served in the revolving restaurant on the 25th floor. The Peony Square downstairs is very good, but the sky in Luoyang is always cloudy. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, unexpectedly beautiful, the workmanship is very good, I help others to buy, very satisfied, much cheaper than the local computer store and home appliance store. 
0	Very poor service! ! ! ! A few friends and I made an appointment to go to Tianjin. For the convenience of everyone playing cards at night, I specifically booked a 2-bedroom and 1-living room in this hotel. Because I arrived first, I naturally registered to open the room first. I was afraid that the hotel would not let me stay if the room reservation time expired. But what I met was the front desk clerk coldly instructing me to register everyone's ID card, otherwise I would not be allowed to go to the elevator! I am surprised, is this the service of a four-star hotel? ! ! ! ! Annoyingly, when my friends were all here and after registering, they found that there was only one person in the room with toiletries and slippers. In other words, the hotel uses this method to prevent us from checking into the room without checking in! It makes me angry! ! ! ! I spent more than six hundred dollars to stay in this so-called 4-star hotel, just to enjoy this inferior service? ! ! ! The nightmare was not over yet. When I checked out the next day, the cashier at the front desk had a phone call with someone for nearly 10 minutes because of my room price. I don’t know if I was deceived by the hotel or by CTRIP. In short, the hotel is so disappointing tonight! Strongly request CRRIP to refund my room fee! Additional comments June 3, 2008: There is a problem with CTRIP's rating. I gave 2 2 points and 2 1 points. Why did you give an average score of 2 points? Are you going to continue to mislead consumers? ! 
1	Nice hotel, one of the best in Liuzhou. The surrounding environment is also very good. 
1	As a budget hotel chain, I think Jinjiang Inn is better than Jiajia and Motel. The most obvious is that the room itself is spacious enough, the toilet is not cramped, and the toilet is still lengthened. A breakfast of 10 yuan is rich. The color and tone of the entire hotel look comfortable, just like home. 
1	The location of the hotel is good, the environment is OK, the room is a bit small, but staying here on business is a very good choice. 
0	A very crude book, after reading it, I think it is too simple and simple. Girls with a little bit of wisdom do not need to choose this book! 
0	In fact, I have seen the first episode of the female psychologist on the Internet. I want to take a closer look and buy a copy on Dangdang. It’s really disgusting. It may be the reason for the piracy. The content of the book is missing. Ten pages, I will not buy books on Dangdang in the future! 
1	I made a reservation for a friend. It was the first time he went to Hong Kong. His evaluation was: it seems a bit smaller than the average standard room, the soundproofing of the room is not very good, and the service is not bad. The transportation is very convenient. There is a subway downstairs, but the price of 961 yuan seems to be a bit high. Next time I go to a place where I would rather live again, the price is cheap. Anyway, it takes only 10 minutes to take the subway to live far away. 
0	The keyboard is easy to get dust, the sound is average, not loud enough, and the sound adjustment buttons feel very hard 
0	First, it will automatically shut down as soon as the wireless network card (usb interface) is inserted; second, the standby time is not as long as claimed; third, it is easier to get fingerprints. 
1	The book arrived on the 7th day after the order was sent, and it was a bit slow. There is no doubt about the quality of the content of the book. This is one of my favorite writers. As for the translation, I haven't read the full text yet. Only in terms of book quality is quite satisfactory. Very plain, no gorgeous cover, no exquisite packaging, and the inner pages are comfortable milky white-this is how my favorite book looks, and the price is unbelievably simple! This is one of the Hexagon series, all of which are affordable and good books. I hope Guangming Daily Publishing House will publish more books like this! 
0	The screen frame is too wide, the width is a bit exaggerated, the top, left and right sides, the fan is still a bit loud, I don’t know why, anyway, the fan keeps ringing when I use it, not too big, not too timid 
1	The appearance and performance of the computer have nothing to say! I believe that I will not choose other brands of computers in the future! 
1	The hotel is really good, but the breakfast is a bit strange in Korean style. 
1	The service is very good, the waiter in the room will pour you a cup of tea, very warm, although the hardware is poor, but the price is very high, next time I go to live in Shanshui 
1	This book is easy to understand. The problems faced by children at almost every stage are mentioned, and there will be very specific solutions. When the book arrived, I almost finished reading it in one sitting. The author's attitude towards children is very relaxed and respectful. She can face and solve any problem in a relaxed and happy manner. After reading this book, she feels that raising children is not as difficult as she thought. Now, my mentality is much calmer because of reading this book, and the scores facing children are much more objective, a lot easier, and I highly recommend it. 
0	"Jingdong’s delivery is too slow. I didn’t ship it for three days after packing. I urged it several times and finally sent it. The order was selected by YTO. Jingdong sent me Zhongtong, and it took 5 days to arrive. In addition, Jingdong’s customer service is not very good. I have to wait for a few consultation information. I only get a reply when I am young. The most annoying thing is always saying ""Please wait a moment. "
0	"The formaldehyde content in the hotel room is too high, which seriously affects the health of the guests. I stayed at 932, and almost got smothered when I opened the door. The next day I opened the door and was thundered again. Changed room 626, the condition is slightly better, but there are three stains on the sheets , There was a reaction with the reception desk when checking out, and it seemed that there was no reaction. For breakfast, you must eat at the speed of the waiter withdrawing the plates, otherwise nothing will be left on the table. Additional review July 6, 2008 Day: Ha, just finished staying, the hotel price dropped from 450 to 418, next time I will ""bargain"" with Ctrip "
1	I bought it at 2199, and the price is very competitive. The workmanship and performance are beyond my expectations, very good. U100 has many functions and is under continuous development. The face recognition software has not been tested yet, and I will go to the next one. 
1	I bought a series and prepared to give it to my nephew. After reading it, the quality of the book is good, and the pictures inside are quite attractive to children. They are all small animals like bears, rabbits, and squirrels. If the child is still young, it is recommended that the parents accompany it. I think it will be helpful for the child’s emotional intelligence development. Moreover, this book is bilingual in Chinese and English, and it can also instill some simple English to children. The above only represents a little bit of my point of view. As for the actual situation, I have to wait for my little nephew to read it before speaking! 
0	Obviously I bought 6 books, but only got 3, and I didn't say what the reason was. How can I believe it in the future? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
1	I stayed at the Hongkou Business Hotel, which is opposite to the Hongkou wine spot. In comparison, the appearance is quite different. The lobby of the hotel is also small and pitiful but I found it good after I checked in. Advantages: The price is suitable for young people or home travel, and the price is relatively high. The bedroom and bathroom are clean and tidy, the location is close to Binhai Avenue (the pride of Yantai people, very beautiful), the transportation is convenient, and the environment is very good. Disadvantages: the soundproofing of the rooms is relatively poor, the internal equipment is a bit simple and outdated (TV), the lobby is small, and the contrast with the Hongkou Hotel opposite is very large, and there are often chickens in the lobby, which is very uncomfortable. 
1	The price this time is a bit more expensive than before, but it is still the first choice for customers. The environment is very good and the service is good. The waiter at the door was dumbfounded, and the others were praised. 
0	Ha ha. A few simple strokes can express such a rich life. Lovely Naoko, lovely life. Reading her comics, life is so good:) In her book, she became a little girl again:) 
0	I really don't like it. I'm absolutely not looking at it. I wasted my energy. I usually give up after watching it. It’s better to read the travel brochure when you have time 
1	"Reading this book, I have an urge to travel in order to carefully appreciate the meaning conveyed by the different styles of architecture. Everything around it becomes vivid. A wall, a window, a wardrobe, a desk, All have her personality and beliefs, the author’s extensive knowledge, unique perspective, and fluent writing, and she likes to ""become a more caring reader and author of our environment"" ""beauty is the promise of happiness. How many views of happiness are there? , There are as many kinds of beauty.-Stendhal"" "
1	The breakfast is very good, the location is good, take a taxi to the train station to have a dozen people 
1	Lightweight, compact and well configured! The delivery speed is fast. Orders are placed at four o'clock in the afternoon and the goods will arrive at ten o'clock in the morning. 
1	I bought it for a friend. He flashed the glasses as soon as he looked at the glasses. The configuration is very good, the style is also very fashionable, and the accessories are very complete, which is worthy of the price. 
1	I can’t enter the system when I just got it and it’s useless. The hard drive is creaking, and the hard drive must be broken or something. Then I have to send it back for return, and then go to another place to get another one, hey, depressed 
1	"I really like the books about the emotional records of Settlement. From ""Absolute Privacy"" to ""Homecoming"" and ""Sorrow and Joy"", the stories in these books have moved me beyond words. It turns out that it is in this society. Perhaps there are life stories of this kind and that kind of people around me, these things, these people are actually by my side, and I haven't discovered them. People say that people will mature if they experience more, and what they experienced also made me mature! Thank you for setting up! "
0	The system initially divided the 160G hard drive into 2 zones. The C drive was actually more than 80G, which was inconvenient to use. Later, it repartitioned and used an external optical drive. WindowsXP Professional was installed. Fortunately, the CD-ROM included the driver , The installation is fairly smooth. 
1	The description of the product is consistent with the actual product. It is indeed HP's top commercial machine, and it feels good to use. You can choose to use the VISTA 32-bit version or the 64-bit version when you first boot up, but there is only one choice. I feel that this price should be worth the money compared to the hardware configuration and software. Many people don’t know this one. The machine used to be very expensive in computer hypermarkets, but like this, the price of electronic products will drop quickly. Speaking of this, it is really good. In addition, the heat dissipation is not as good as many comments on the Internet say, it is very hot after booting, especially next to the HP LOGO at the bottom of the screen 
0	"Since it is called a reading manual, it should be a book that can be read to children! When I opened it, I realized that the whole book was written nonsense around the 8-character ""read for children aloud"", and only the last few pages of the recommended list of books read to the children are somewhat useful. Summary: This is a worthless title party junk book "
1	1. Exquisite appearance and excellent workmanship. Fast delivery speed 2. Bright led screen, large viewing angle 3. The keyboard layout is okay, but it is a bit smaller 4. The Internet is powerful and the signal receiving ability is strong. Compatible with gsm and td-scdma dual cards 
1	Homeinn’s positioning is very good, I still book Homeinn on business trips. This time I ran into trouble at the shop on the 11th Avenue. The wallet was stolen while eating at the restaurant on the first floor! I was very careful when I went out. I noticed that there were only a few in-house guests dining in the restaurant, so I relaxed my vigilance and put my jacket on the chair. The thief spotted me and took my pocket from behind. (I regret it, I'm afraid it won't be easy for the thief to start sitting in the last row!). The little waiter (estimated to be less than 20) felt something, and kindly reminded me to put on my clothes. I still find it strange that I haven't done it (I deserve to lose money, and people hinted at me, but I didn't respond). Please be careful when you come to this store in Tianjin again! 
0	The fan rotates more frequently. This seems to be a common problem with Acer. The sound quality is not as good as the 49 series. The power socket is a bit tight and uncomfortable. It takes a little effort to pull out each time. It is more troublesome to install the system. It is recommended to put a dos directly after acer. installation. 
0	My order on November 6th has not arrived today! Dangdang shows that the transaction has been completed! What is going on! Order number: 1421846721 I placed my order on November 6, which has not arrived today! Dangdang shows that the transaction has been completed! What is going on!

0	I thought there were a lot of pictures in it. It turned out to be text. I was really not in the mood to read this kind of book. The most important thing was that there was no photo of the author. How can I be sure that she is a 31-year-old beauty? Not too convincing. 
1	I won't talk about the advantages, let's talk about the problems found. 1. Even if the hardware is DDR3, since the CPU bus is only 800, the memory is reduced to 800 for use. 2. I have asked you, where are the options for adjusting the integrated graphics memory? ? ? 
0	"The online introduction to the book ""Dulala's Promotion"" is very good. I have seen many typos in the book. I am disappointed and regretful! I think it should not be a matter of the writing level of the writer! ! ! "
0	From any angle, the hotel can only be rated as 2 stars. Ctrip recommended this hotel first. I think there is only one reason: the hotel has the highest rebate? Additional comments March 11, 2008: Lessons! 
1	It is very close to the airport, 15 minutes, less than 20 yuan, but it is too far from the city, and there is a barren road in the middle, there is a Yichu lotus next to it, there is also a Pearl Plaza, the environment is still good, the rooms are also Row. Ctrip's price is very uncompetitive. My friend and I stayed at the same time. My room rate was 548. My friend booked through her company and the room rate was only 410. 
1	<Recommended Book> Takagi Naoko's manga breaks through the framework of other than my girly manga, but it has full of family warmth. When you are in a bad mood, be sure to read it more, and you will be in a good mood after reading it! 
0	Zhongtong is too rubbish, there is no notice when it arrives, and it is not delivered to many places. You have to pick it up by yourself. Jingdong is too that, and it does not need better express delivery for large items. Does anyone know how to use the microphone? My microphone has no sound 
0	1. The piano lacquer shell is a fingerprint collector 2. The border of the screen feels a bit too wide 3. There is only one memory slot, the upgrade can only replace the original 1G memory 
0	I got the urge to buy this book only after reading the propaganda in the newspaper. Later I searched the Internet and found it was not expensive, so I bought it. I took a short time to look at it, and I thought it was so-so. Value for money, 
0	The memory is small, and the fan sound is loud when starting up. The user name and password could not be found in the pre-installed linux system. 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
1	The environment is very good, the location is very convenient, the service is also very good, I will live next time! 
0	It belongs to a government guest house. The hotel facilities are very general and the service attitude is not very satisfactory. The bed linen in the room is not clean, and the pillowcase has a large area of oil stains. It is still the same after changing one. There are a lot of hair under the sheets and the quilt is covered. There are sporadic blood stains, and the breakfast quality is too poor. It is the same every day, which makes people lose appetite. Breakfast for 18 yuan is a bowl of porridge and an egg. I hope that hotels in Handan can improve the quality and service level as much as possible 
1	"The study and research of the cultural knowledge of ""The Songs of Chu"" is a field generally involved in university Chinese; the spirit of the times represented by Qu Yuan is worthy of consideration and study for future generations; this book is currently the most comprehensive and authoritative work on ""The Songs of the Chu"". Regardless of the breadth or depth of the knowledge involved, it is in line with general readers with knowledge of classical Chinese. The Zhonghua Book Company has always respected the original author’s writing habits and the structure of the first edition in the layout and edition of the text, so this book has the emotional appeal of ""remembering the old for things, and seeking newness for people"".

0	The memory is a bit smaller, but now the memory is cheap! The operating system needs to be reinstalled; cup amd is often mobile and the stability is not as good as intel; but I rarely move it; type integrated graphics; the fan is very loud; Linux system is very troublesome to change windows; 
1	Ordered standard A, the room decoration is relatively new. It's just that the hot water in the bath will heat up for about 7-8 minutes. The neighborhood is very lively, downstairs is the Confucian Temple, some ancient Minnan architecture, opposite is the Copper Buddha Temple, and not far from the Guandi Temple and the mosque. But some distance from the bus station, about 20 minutes on foot. However, the price of standard A is only 268 (without breakfast) on weekends, and usually costs 300. It's just that the star-rated hotels seem to be stingy, and they don't have to pay for bottled water. On the contrary, business hotels will send 2 bottles of water for free. 
0	Fever is common, but from the 6515b that I started to use in 2007, this heat did not cause any problems. You should not use your hands to touch it when it does not exist, unless you want to boil eggs, haha 
1	When I first saw it, I felt that it was not the same as what I usually came into contact with. It turns out that the world is like this in the eyes of others. Looking at problems from the perspective of the country and the nation is a serious and meaningful thing in itself. I think everyone is born with a sense of national identity and needs some nationalism. Some ideas in the book have a vigilant effect on me. However, you still need to look at it dialectically, you need to understand the author's words with your own judgment, and you can't passively accept it all. As the saying goes, don’t take it into the ditch, haha 
0	The plastic feel of the shell is too strong! At first glance, I think it’s a low-end product. Why don’t you make the case a little better and feel more comfortable? 
0	I bought it only after seeing the ranking, but the book is big and messy. None of them are all paintings. I don't like it, but my son is fine. As a storyteller, I don’t seem to feel it, so I can’t get involved. 
1	Although Bingbing is dead, I am very upset, but I still gave you a five-star rating to encourage you and see the after-effects. 
0	It is said that it is 4 stars, but there is no non-smoking room, which is really speechless. Hotel Feedback April 28, 2008: Dear guests, thank you very much for staying at Seven Star Business Hotel! The 10th floor of this hotel is a non-smoking floor guest room, and the floors and guest rooms have obvious non-smoking floor signs. We sincerely look forward to your next visit to our hotel, we will try our best to meet your reservation needs. 
1	excellent service. Meals are served 24 hours. We arrived at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the evening and provided dinner specifically for us, which was very moved and the price was relatively affordable. The only thing that was not enough was that the check-in procedures in Building 1 and Building 2 were handled separately. We first drove to the hotel lobby and were told that this was Building 2 and we had to go to Building 1. But Ctrip did not tell which building it was when booking. 
1	1. The hotel is relatively new, the decoration and facilities are not bad, but the room smells of paint. 2. Breakfast is ok, but there are not many varieties. 3. The traffic is more convenient, and there are more small restaurants around. 
1	Advantages: The service in the lobby and housekeeping department is very good and enthusiastic (because there is no refrigerator to help us get ice cubes from out). The characteristic big bed room comes with tea pillows and some interesting magazines. The location is good, with Carrefour around. The shopping plaza, the transportation is convenient, the breakfast is great, the buffet is very rich, Chinese and Western styles are available, and the speed of adding dishes is very fast. Disadvantages: Very poor sound insulation, woken up by the guests next door at night. Work started and I can't sleep at all. No small refrigerator, TV, no satellite channels, facilities such as toilets, towels are a bit old, but ok 
1	The book is better than I thought. It was installed with win7 and did not encounter the black screen of Baofengyingyin. The running speed is very fast and the heat dissipation is also good. I bought the books online for the first time and they arrived very quickly. I feel very satisfied. And buying this configuration at this price is a great value. 
0	I don't think people who are bored should not read this book. After reading it, it is super depressed. It is a very bored book. I can only say that~~ 
1	"Both adults and children like it! It's just that some texts and pictures are more subtle and children can't understand them, but adults can read them with joy. For example, on the back cover, the earthworm slanted his eyes and said: ""I seem to feel peeked."" I made a fuss: ""Why does the earthworm feel peeked? Who is peeking at its diary?"" I don't understand, I have been enlightening for a long time, and then I slowly introduce her to the correct understanding, and then I know how to laugh. Enjoy the enlightenment process! I believe that after a few years, Nao will still look for this book on her small bookshelf! "
1	Generally speaking, the hotel’s service facilities and the attitude of the service staff are quite good, but the provision of free broadband as mentioned when booking the hotel is not available. Therefore, the laptop specially brought is useless. I wanted to pay with a credit card when I checked out, but I was told that I could not swipe the card on the day. It is recommended that the information in this area needs to be more accurate. 
0	Very general, not in recent years. The aesthetics are also temporal, and the colors and expressions are not as good as the works of recent years. 
1	The lobby of the hotel is very nice, and the rooms are very nice, warm and comfortable. It is a nice five-star hotel. 
1	I saw this movie when I was young, and I really liked the round face of the little heroine, the sea of eyebrows, and the soft and sweet words. Her world is so straightforward and bright, her life is so beautiful, and her kindness to people is so sincere. I don't remember at what age I watched it, but I have a deep memory. One time when I was drinking water at Sisyphus Coffee Shop, I accidentally turned to this book, and it evoked my memory. My heart is still warm, kind and warm, but a little bit sentimental. Perhaps as expressed in the black and white photographic pictures in the book, some things and some scenes have passed and will not be repeated. 
0	The words are too small, and it’s too tired to read while lying down. There is a lot of space about eating. I live alone, so I don’t want to spend so much time at home tossing and eating. 
1	It’s very cost-effective and practical. I haven’t heard of this brand before I decided to buy it:-) I’m a bit ignorant, and I still like it after I bought it. After more than a week, there is no abnormality, I hope it won’t happen again. . 
1	The first is the hotel pick-up service that satisfies me. This is a consensus with everyone. I came to Jiugang for work. It is very convenient to go to Jiugang for work. No car attendant will help me book a car with enthusiasm and thoughtfulness. What moved me more was that I was going to work the next day, but the day before I found that the clothes were hanging. I was in a hurry to go out and didn’t have time to deal with it. I also had poor sewing skills. So I found the waiter in desperation. When I came back The clothes are patched up, and the leather shoes are polished. It must not have been a delay. I would like to express a small gratitude to them for their service! Supplementary comment December 20, 2007: After reading everyone’s comments, I added a few words: I despise the friend of 9785****, pay the education fund only 6 yuan before, but still have to reimburse, no reimbursement still complain, live People from high-class hotels! This is a digression, please don't take offense. I really can't see it anymore, I support public welfare! 
0	At first I was quite interested, but later I felt boring. I felt that the things she was thinking about and the perspective of the problem were particularly not suitable for me. 
0	The sound is light, the touchpad is too sensitive and easy to misuse. The buttons below are too rigid. Too heavy, lighter is better 
0	Very disappointed in a hotel. The facilities are better than Zibo Hotel and other hotels, but the smoke smell of the room is very heavy. This is still a non-smoking room. Forget these, I didn’t expect much from Zibo hotels, but I didn’t expect it to be there. To make matters worse, I booked a car to a hotel in Jinan. The concierge told me that it was 280 yuan. I confirmed the reservation and stated that it was listed on my room account at checkout. I called again early the next morning to confirm. At 1 o’clock in the checkout, the lady at the front desk said that she had not received the reservation, she was very arrogant and rude, and asked me to settle the room fee first, and then the concierge brought a receipt and asked me to sign the price not 280 yuan, but 280 yuan + 15% service charge. This is the first time I have encountered this situation. The hotel said that if I pay in cash, I still need to pay 280 yuan, and I don’t need to pay 15% service charge. I asked the deputy lobby manager to come over. She explained that the hotel has to pay a handling fee for credit card, so it charges 15 %, I think it is unreasonable, because 1) the concierge did not explain this when I ordered the car, 2) the bank's handling fee was 15%, and I have never heard of such a high bank card handling fee. Finally, under my strong protest, the deputy manager of the lobby said that he would still charge the credit card at 280 yuan. Only when I got on the reserved car, I found out that it was a taxi, not a hotel special car. Because the hotel does not have a fleet, it signed an agreement with 5 taxis. The taxi pays the hotel a management fee of several thousand yuan each year, and then the hotel guests decide to go. The car at Jinan Airport called them, to explain that the taxi I took was very good. From the point of view of price and service ratio, this hotel is not suitable, I will not stay again. 
0	"1. The supply is tight. The order placed on June 19th only arrives on the 27th. 2. The built-in Vista is too slow, and I added 1G of memory, and now it’s okay. 3. Why the factory configuration of the outer box Is ""Dual Core Processor"" printed on the label? "
1	The appearance is pretty, the screen is a bit small, and it is troublesome to install the system. Everyone tells me which camera driver is the camera driver. You will get the package as soon as you buy it. Lost a package. Everything else is fine 
0	The heat dissipation is average, and the mouse is a bit small. The biggest problem is that the sound of a fan at the bottom is abnormal when I turn it on for the first time. I called JD customer service and pushed me to ASUS customer service. . . I pressed it with my hand and found that it was the sound of the fan. I don't know how to solve it! 
1	I bought it for my 4-year-old son. The content of the story is very practical. I went to kindergarten, built sand castles by the beach, kindergarten was punished, and lost the shopping mall. They all fit the children's flat-field behavior and have basically encountered them. It's just that there are not many cases where children have younger siblings. The language of the story is very childish, and the pictures are also very vivid. My son likes it very much. However, the content of a book is not too much, and I feel that it is more suitable for children who have just started kindergarten. For children over 4 years old, it is a bit simpler. 
0	The biggest disadvantage is that the memory is too small. Fortunately, I bought another 1G. The driver CD is only for VISTA, and XP can be downloaded from the official website 
1	Although I watched TV programs, I still bought this book, first because I think it’s good to flip through in my free time, it’s not big, and it’s easy to take it with you when I’m out; second, because the story is not long and it won’t be very tiring; The third is that it is highly readable. When you read it repeatedly, you will have new ideas. I am actually a very practical person. I usually don’t buy things that cannot be used repeatedly, and I save resources. After reading it, I feel that it is very suitable for people who encounter problems when contacting people. Language communication is the most contact with people. This is an important course. After reading the book, you will understand that small problems that you don't pay much attention to may be the problems in your interaction with people. 
0	The screen is a 06 Samsung screen, although it is not a snowflake screen, but the effect is really very general, and the effect of LED is even more incomparable. The A side does not seem to be made of magnesium-aluminum alloy, and the fingerprint recognition is also cancelled. The old models are all available (the chipset is also different) 
0	Let's not talk about the advantages, let's talk about the disadvantages. 1. The POS machine at the front desk really needs to be changed. The card swipe is surprisingly slow. 1. The attitude of the front desk staff is not very good. 3. Too noisy, the most terrible shortcoming. The main function of a hotel can provide a relatively quiet environment, but living here is really noisy, so contact the front desk to ignore it. 4. There is no all-day heating, which is really funny. I asked the front desk to provide it after five o'clock. I think such a big hotel is different from a small hotel, which also provides 24-hour heating. Really funny. 
1	I am very happy to see that Yaoyao has finally completed this new work, which can be regarded as filling a gap in the publication of professional books on the domestic bjd doll circle. It provides a more detailed copy for newbies who are new to the baby circle or who are about to become a baby mother. The guide to raising a baby deserves encouragement. In the book, Yaoyao vividly tells the mental journey of a mother to raise a baby in her own tone. As Jiazhen introduced her young masters, at the same time, it also showed everyone the persistence and enthusiasm of Yaoyao. I sincerely hope that Yaoyao and Ziyu will continue to work hard to create your perfect and gorgeous doll world~ 
0	"I ran up and down in China many times a year, and this hotel is the worst cost-effective hotel I have ever stayed in. 1. The service attitude is terrible, maybe they were too busy when I went, and they were too lazy to talk to you. 2. The room is bad, the room I live in is subsidized, I don't mind the Chinese building in the 1980s, but you can paint it with white paint. The walls of my room are in two colors and the ceiling is in three colors. Of course, it is not color matching, but a supplementary subsidy. 3. TV, actually uses an antenna~~ Yes, you read that right, they don’t have cable TV, let alone satellite TV. 4. The room was dirty, the toilet and basin in the bathroom churned, and mold grew on the edges of the floor. There are inexplicable ""liquids"" on the corners of the room 5, and the location is too far away, and there is a fight on the side of the exhibition hall. 6. Breakfast, forget it. 7. By the way, the entrance on the second floor is made of iron plates, which are full of covered bridges. Comrades, if you are going to the exhibition or staying at Jinjiang Inn or something else, you have to fight anyway. Hotel boss, sorry, you are so bad, by the way, my room number is 207. "
1	I got it today, and I tried it off. The large screen is good for playing games and watching HD. After all, the graphics card is quite strong. The heat dissipation is also good, and the fan is relatively quiet. 
0	1. The interior decoration is acceptable, but the surrounding environment is poor and the room is small, so the price of the room is high and not cost-effective. 2. The bed in a double room is only about 1 meter wide. It feels bad, like a crib. 3. The breakfast price is 56 yuan, and there are few varieties. If the room does not include breakfast, don't go, just like grabbing money. Chinese food and lunch are not open. If you want to eat, then look for it in the distance under the sun. 4. Recently, due to work reasons, I have traveled to many cities and stayed in many hotels. This is the only mid-range hotel that charges for Internet access (maybe I am ignorant). 36 yuan a day is simply unreasonable. The extra room fee is more than 400 yuan, which is a bit outrageous for such a room. 5. The room air conditioner is too loud, and the effect is not good, not generally bad. I don't know what the other rooms are like. 6. An episode: When I opened the door when I checked in, a steel frame was placed in the aisle, and a compressor in operation was roaring, just blocking the aisle. I had to put my luggage in the hallway and called the waiter to take it away, but it turned out to be notified three times and waited 10 minutes before someone came to drag the machine away, and there was no apology. 7. TV sets 2-18 are almost all foreign channels, mostly in Japanese. Feeling uncomfortable. Additional comments July 3, 2007: A little typo: It should be: Chinese and dinner are not open

0	The graphics card is 9300, which wastes so much video memory. It takes a lot of effort to install the XP system. It is necessary to change the hard disk in the BIOS to IDE 
1	1. The heat dissipation is very good. Under normal circumstances, the heat dissipation is very good one day after booting, which is much better than the colleague's HP (without running large programs) 2. Very good luck, perfect screen, no bright spots, dark spots and dead spots 3. Sound is good, although a little bit small , But not as bad as others said, overall good 4. Hitachi's hard disk and CD-ROM, when running, there is no phenomenon other people said that the disk cannot be read or the sound is loud 
1	The location is very close to the airport and relatively quiet. The room is large, the hot spring bath is good, and there is a heated swimming pool, it is recommended to bring a swimsuit. The breakfast has many varieties and good service. A good hotel in Zhengzhou. 
0	This hotel is very expensive because it is located next to the China World Trade Center. Because it is close to our company, it feels like it is not much different from a hotel of around 200 yuan. .. 
1	After staying at this hotel, I felt pretty good, not as bad as the reviews on the Internet. I started to see the reviews on the Internet and worried that this hotel is not good. It seems redundant! When I first entered the hall, I actually had my name on the display screen. I was really surprised! The waiters here are very enthusiastic. Although the bed is a little smaller, it is clean and tidy and the service is very good! The location is also good, close to the city center, and there is a car to Mogao Grottoes when you go out. This trip to Dunhuang was quite enjoyable! ! 
0	Maybe it's the jade in front. I have bought the ** Meridian Massage written by another person. Looking back on this book, I feel disappointed? The more I look, the more dizzy, unintelligible, and too much nonsense. I believe that the author is an excellent healer but definitely not a qualified author. But if you have time, you can pick up a selection with a pen in one hand and a paper in the other, and there will be a few inspirations. But this book is really a book with a lot of water and a great degree of hype! 
1	According to online reviews, I booked a 400-day standard room. I went to the store and told Ctrip that I could only live in the northwest facing room. I felt a bit musty and asked to change the room. After the change, the northwest facing floor was higher and the musty smell was less; room windows and furniture , The toilets are all old models, not of good grade, the bed is very comfortable; the service is good, I feel that the floor is better than the front desk service; the surrounding environment of the hotel is really good, there are mountains and seas, I almost fell off the cliff when I was walking in the back mountain, I suggest the hotel It is too dangerous to add signs and fences on the back mountain halfway in time! Walking and playing with children at night is more dangerous! 
0	The USB port on the left is too close, and the external device is bigger. They cannot be inserted at the same time. The sound of the optical drive is not so loud. Handwriting software is tasteless and useless. Express expansion card slot is not a universal type, is it a future trend. I used to buy a wireless network card and cannot use it. 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
0	I bought it for my children, so I can relax my mood. Watch with my son, there are more common languages. We all like it. 
1	The appearance is great, I like the all-black texture. The battery is really super durable. It only prompts automatic shutdown after nearly 7.5 hours of discharging (watching movies, surfing the Internet). The screen is of good quality and no dead pixels are found. The chocolate keyboard is also very useful for people with larger hands. Blind typing errors are rare. 
0	"Regarding this shop and the 3-day stay, I can only say: too bad, really bad! Regret, regret it very much! The location is very inconvenient and the front desk service is extremely poor. I have to queue for checkout at noon on the 17th (only one person is on duty). I am unwilling to change the invoice and ask me to change it. I don't know if it is the same for other Home Inns. Ctrip should investigate this store responsibly. Additional comments May 18, 2008: More than ""quiet"", ""quiet"" is woken up by people calling for friends at six or seven o'clock every morning, and there is no hotel to remind them to pay attention. After finally falling asleep again, when the waiter knocked on the door one by one (saying to clean the room) as soon as eight o'clock, he woke up again, extremely depressed! When I arrived at the restaurant on the first floor, I was told that I had to go to the front desk on the first floor to buy a breakfast voucher before I could dine. I didn't buy it for two more days. I almost rushed to them and told me to buy it, but the ticket was not refundable! This is really outrageous! "
0	That is to say, some things that people think that everyone doesn't know are popularized, that is, the position is moved up so little to the newcomers who are suitable for edifying the workplace. . . 
1	To be honest, if you are an economics teacher, I think this book is really useful for you, because its examples are closely related to life, lively and interesting, and can enliven your classroom atmosphere. If you are a college student who is just getting in touch with economics, it can let you experience the joy of learning economics faster and guide you to get started. So these two kinds of people are recommended to buy. After all, from the perspective of cost-effectiveness, this book is worth your purchase. However, if you have ever studied economics, with good grades, and some social and life experience, then this book is a bit shallow for you and is not recommended. 
1	MSI’s keyboard is top-notch among many netbooks and feels good. This price is about the same as the price of the phone I bought two years ago. Before I bought it, I asked JD’s customer service that there was no inner bag, but it was realized. 
1	Because I like it, I have recommended it to my colleagues and friends. It is a good gift for children. 
1	It feels very textured, and the price/performance ratio is relatively good. The efficiency of logistics is also relatively high, and it will be delivered early the next morning 
1	The appearance is good, the performance is excellent, the heat dissipation is good, the temperature of the palm rest is not high, and it feels more comfortable to use. 
0	A book that feels rather boring. Nondescript. It was very tangled when I watched it, and I have no impression after reading it. The language is boring, and the characters are even more boring. I regret buying it. 
1	The graphics card is pretty good. Large-scale 3D online games can also bear it, and the heat dissipation is also done well. The picture is done well, the rendering is beautiful, 
1	The performance is balanced, the display effect is not bad, and the heat dissipation is not bad. The Little Red Riding Hood of THINKPAD, hard disk protection is all right? 
0	I feel very disappointed. This book is so popular. But it is not what I want. The author is a blogger. It is his freedom to write. But the book should be published with rigorous chapters. The source is well cited. Otherwise, how can you be worthy of the reader? See in In my eyes, I can only think of this comment-I have the desire to write novels. I don't have the ability to write history. 1. In Zhu Yuanzhang's life, how important roles Liu Ji and Hu Weiyong are. But in this book, the so-called resourceful Liu Ji. The author only wrote about the so-called Battle of Anfeng. And it was just two sentences from Liu Ji admonishing Zhu Yuanzhang not to attack. In this way, Liu Ji’s miraculous plan could be positioned? What about other battles. What about other tactics. Where is Liu Ji’s role? Hu Weiyong writes more. But what about his evil appearances. What about his use of tactics? They are all in one stroke. Compared with his description of war scenes. That is really insignificant. 2. The author's strength is obviously war scenes. And some short stories. Although I still quote ancient texts. I also help us translate. But I don’t think the general direction has been set. The important protagonist group configuration weight is not well grasped. Many events are just a light stroke. It can be seen that the references are insufficient 3. The tone of writing Of course it can be the author’s own style. The author reinterpreted the chaotic history of Ming Dynasty in modern buzzwords. But the author has repeatedly tried to describe the mood in the first person. But it is sensational and spends a long chapter... He can only say... A book should be a novel 
1	Yes, the outside looks relatively old, but the inside is very clean, the traffic is very convenient, and check out is fast. You can watch the music fountain in the room, which is good. 
0	The optical drive is a bit noisy, and the disk reading is not good. I installed xp and replaced 3 disks. The battery time is too short, only 2.15 hours, and the 16:9 screen is not used 
0	The screen resolution is low, it seems that it is not an LED screen but an LCD, and the camera does not seem to be 130W, a bit like the 30W domestic machine 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the performance is not bad, add a 2G memory, change the XP system. Good to use, good screen 
0	"This ""The Analects of Confucius"" was too popular and shallow. I finished reading it in one hour and gave it away quickly. I felt sorry for my money when others thought it was good "
0	The chosen case is too bizarre, it exaggerates the practical significance of psychological counseling and makes people lose their sense of trust! If the effect of writing in this way can catch the reader's attention at the beginning, but when he sees the explanation of the reasons for the psychological problems of the protagonist in the case, he gradually loses interest. 
0	It is not a GN40 chipset, and watching movies consumes too much CPU. It's a bit heavy, it's a bit heavy to carry in the bag. 
0	I ordered 4 pieces and only received 1 piece without any explanation. I called to inquire, just one sentence, out of stock, and the webpage was not updated in time. If you want to buy, place another order. Ha, I really got it right. From the order to the receipt of the item, the webpage was not updated for half a month. I don't know what the speed is. This is my first time shopping in Dangdang, and probably the last time. 
1	Our whole family can reach the moon together. After reading it for ten days, my son is already familiar with this book. When I put on his pants after taking a shower, he stood on my lap and said that the moon was enough. I said that I couldn't reach it. He said, call mother, I said, mother can’t reach, he said, call grandma, I said grandma can’t reach, he said father..., look at his serious expression, listen to the whisper An angry childish voice, I think, the feeling at this time cannot be expressed in words. Very happy, very beautiful, and enjoy! Thank the author for giving the child a wonderful moon story, and thank you for this wonderful parent-child space! 
0	Only slogans, no depth. Disorganization is just a waste of our time. But the target audience may be different. It is recommended to look at Guoxue, but to look at Nan Huaijin. The depth, breadth, thoroughness, rigorous and humble attitude, among these so-called scholars, it is difficult to find someone like Nan Huaijin. 
0	The pre-installed system is very troublesome to modify VISTA and WXP. However, it can be fully installed in 3 hours. The screen is very reflective and the aspect ratio is very strange, so I did not find a suitable film. Sometimes the keys are not sensitive enough. The bottom front has been used for a long time and is hot. 
1	Internet access is too expensive, 40 yuan a day. The traffic is still very convenient, very close to the subway station. 
0	The hotel is already in the outskirts and it is not convenient to take a taxi. There are too few guests to stay. It feels deserted. However, you need to provide a credit card guarantee when booking. It is said that the room is tight, but in fact, it may be afraid of the guests running away. Services and facilities are too general. Additional comments November 13, 2007: However, Guiyang is a typical dirty mess. Dongdong is still too expensive. If you go to Guiyang, don’t have any good wishes! 
1	The configuration is good, and the appearance is good, but the sound effect of the speaker is very general. There is a big gap between using the HP one. 
0	"There are so many friends who have commented on Diamond Apartment, so I might as well say a few more words. Diamond's newly launched ""special"" double room is not a special offer at all. In the past, foreign friends came to Shanghai and they always recommended diamonds, and they were quite satisfied. But this time I stayed in the newly launched special double room in early July. Friends reported that the room was much smaller than before, and overall it was much worse than the previous suite. When booking the room, the price difference between the double special room and the suite is only a few dozen yuan, but the actual situation is quite different. I think this is a diamond fooling the guests. "
1	I have just gotten married and have no children. I have always been confused about one thing-whether to have children or not, because I have seen too many relatives and friends around me because of their problems and the children have headaches, and because I have been arguing with my parents since I was young. Parents are actually very sad when they are angry. Sometimes they can’t help thinking that in the future, my children will also fight with me like this, make me worry about it, and make me angry if they are not obedient. So there are great concerns about having children. It wasn't until I read this book that I was relieved. It turned out that good children were not brought by luck, they were cultivated through hard work. Thank you the author of this book. 
1	Many stories have been quoted many times in various inspirational books, but every time they are revisited, they will still be touched, inspired, and inspired. There is always an emotion deep in the heart that is touched. This is like human instinct, in human nature. There will always be an original plot of self-motivated, tolerant, brave, and great love. Even if some of them seem to have been worn away by years of experience and growth, they are actually deposited in the deepest place. Therefore, a good book is to constantly touch the positive energy of human nature, every time you read it, you will find new discoveries, and you will never tire of reading it. 
0	Breakfast is average. The room is clean, but the noise is too much, the price is relatively expensive 
0	This book is in very popular language. It says what everyone knows. If you can’t learn anything, don’t be confused by the sales volume. 
0	What does 2--10 years old mean? I don’t think there is a book that can cover such a range. In fact, my two-year-old daughter cannot understand the content of this set of books. I tried to explain to her, but I had to describe those stories in a language that the two-year-old could understand. The content is very difficult. I guess why this book is popular in the West (written by a book review). Maybe children in the West live in a different environment from those in the East and have different educational backgrounds. They know what a farm is like, and we understand the countryside or farmhouse better. In other words, cultural differences lead to cognitive differences, so translation cannot be just a one-to-one correspondence of languages, but a leap between cultures. 
0	The price is a bit more expensive; it is also very troublesome to install xp. The official website does not provide xp drivers. The driver problem has not been solved until now. The old blue screen, it is recommended that the brothers who install xp carefully consider it. 
0	"Never live! The first is the smell of moldy in the corridors and rooms! And the breakfast is super terrible! The most unbearable is the service at the hostel level! My colleagues (2 men) and I checked in at approximately 8:50 pm on September 10. When arriving at the front desk, there were two attendants on duty, both of whom were going through the formalities for the other two residents. I was waiting by the side, no one said to me polite words like ""please wait a moment"". After the two guests were processed, the waiter ignored me. I took the initiative to say that I booked the room. Then one of the waiters threw me a registration form while chatting with an unidentified person (in front of the front desk, not wearing any uniform). During my check-in, the waiter kept chatting with that person. The waiter never confirmed the room with me "
1	Cost-effective. It runs ordinary documents, Internet, movies, and it is no different from Thinkpad T400. The appearance is beautiful, which stands out in black. 
0	Heavier. I wrote the LINUV system, but it was bare metal after it was turned on. I went to the official maintenance and after-sales service point to spend 50 yuan to reinstall the system, hate Jingdong. A complaint has been made. Looking forward to the processing result. 
1	Fresh and delicate text, warm and touching plot, occasionally confused but hearty and independent female protagonist, handsome and elegant and knowledgeable and restrained male protagonist, there are so many Chinese medicine prescriptions that I am familiar with, the name of Chinese medicine in each chapter and After the chapter, the full text of the decoction and medicine, after careful reading, the author's skill is remarkable, and I wonder if the author came from a Chinese medicine school. Shengli's words are like flowing water, and the feelings in the text are like flowing water, light, but very touching. Perhaps, only such long flowing feelings are the longest. 
1	I decided to buy this one because I have already learned about the performance and appearance of all aspects, so no unexpected problems have been found so far. Small and portable is the biggest factor in my choice. Secondly, the brand machine is more reassuring, and you can feel it while unpacking. The 3G Internet speed is faster than the speed of my original desktop + ADSL 2M. I wiped it for more than two hours yesterday and found no disconnection. The keyboard is quite comfortable (maybe my hands are not big). 
1	"It’s been a long time since I saw a book that suits my taste. I really regret that I didn’t have such a book as a guide when I first joined the job. Through the research of this book, I think about my career performance, and many things can be done better in the future, at least I don't want to offend people. I don't know what happened. Now, I will have a more comprehensive analysis of many things. In the past, I only heard about EQ and IQ, but didn't care too much. After watching ""Dula Lala"", I realized that the level of EQ in dealing with things has a lot to do with the future of the workplace. Only knowing that I am short can make up for it. I am very grateful to ""Dulala"" for giving me life guidance. "
1	"The single room is a little bit small, but basically enough. I have broadband Internet access, but the Internet speed is slow. The room on the south side is relatively quiet, and the sound of vehicles passing by will be heard at night in the north side of the west end. There are more ""massage"" calls at 6 in the morning, ^_^; if you don't want to be disturbed, unplug the phone. Additional comments July 31, 2007: Credit cards are available "
0	With the Tom series that I bought, this one has been stranded, it feels very messy, and there is no storyline. A 3-year-old 3-month-old boy does not plan to buy this series of books 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the weight is very light, it does not feel heavy, the delivery is fast, and the order the night before will arrive the next afternoon 
1	I caught up with the store celebration and gave a gift. The book is of good quality and the installation went smoothly. VISTA is also very convenient for office use. 
0	It's because the paper is thicker and sharper. My child broke his hand when he read the book for the first time and fainted...The publishing house didn't have any safety awareness!!! 
0	This book is not as good as I expected. The quality and printing of the book itself are okay, but the content does not match the title of the book, so the name should be changed; and there are a lot of far-fetched places, and some places are a bit hard to beat. Come out and say...); I feel that the author is a little reluctant to scrape the content, want to make the book look thicker? Personal advice, for reference only; 
1	It’s cheap. Yes, I think this configuration is very good after everything is set up. The speed is also very fast. The heat dissipation is good. The keyboard is much more comfortable to use than my own small notebook. The notebook is bought for dad. My husband also wanted it after seeing it. 
0	The printed version is a color version, but unfortunately, the form is much larger than the content, and the content is really simple. I will explain here that my English level is average, the taste is poor, and there is no practicality. I do not recommend you to buy it. 
1	The hotel in Luoyang is still good, the restaurant is also OK, and the service is good. 
0	It was shown on August 6th that my order was processed. It has been half a month and I haven't got the book yet. When will I get it? I hope you can be supervised! 
0	There are only two districts, the rookie won’t divide it by himself, just one more district. The logistics attitude is super bad 
0	I don’t know if it’s due to the high CPU frequency or poor heat dissipation. I feel that the left half of the keyboard and the left palm rest are very hot. The CPU standby has a 57 degree hard disk 47 degrees, which is 47 degrees harder than the F8 series CPU. It's much worse. There is too little memory, you need to add another one yourself. 
0	I feel that this book is not as good as imagined. It is a bit too fascinating, and there are not many practical things. On the contrary, there are too many things like how to praise everyone. 
0	It is a Samsung brand, but the interior, appliances, environment and cost performance are still too poor. It may be the peak tourist season in Harbin, because it is the season of ice and snow? The smell of sweat in the room is really unbearable! 
1	It's far inferior to the previous IBM. Now it has poor workmanship, and there are obvious strokes on the edges and edges. The second thing is that the two notes (I bought two) are obviously different in quality. Last time I bought a lenovo y430 high configuration , If there is a problem, it is returned, there is a problem with the product, anyway, it is just do! I sincerely hope that Lenovo Group has appointed some agents, and after-sales services must be strictly controlled so as not to affect reputation, otherwise consumers will tend to other brands! 
0	Checked in last month, nearly 500 yuan a day, the bathroom is very small, like a budget hotel. The hallway room smelled of musty. The drain pipe of the bathtub was leaking, dripping everywhere. Less than 30 meters outside the window is a residential area with constant speakers. What's even more ridiculous is that I was told at the checkout that the room rate booked by Ctrip did not include the service fee, and an additional 10% service fee was charged. I have booked so many times with Ctrip, and I have booked a lot of Five Stars. This is the first time I have encountered it. In short, the hotel is poor and the room rate is unreasonable! 
0	When I first returned to Chengdu, I had no place to live, so I had to wait for my friend's nearest place to order crape myrtle. I was worried before I went because the evaluation of the hotel has not been very good. I was really disappointed when I arrived at the lobby. The service staff were like they had just been recruited from the surrounding job market. Even the clothes were not very clean! The attitude is still very cold! The biggest drawback in the room is the design problem. The glass door of the balcony cannot be opened, and the whole room cannot be ventilated. It is very stuffy! ! However, the breakfast will still be available and the service is okay, so it can be considered a four-star hotel. The others are really disappointing. It's better not to go! ! 
0	Talk about fairness? The whole book is buying advertisements, and everything is defending itself. Please, the housework will be settled at home, what book is there? He also gave a philosophical title to deceive people. 
0	1. The driver is incomplete, and you have to download it yourself. It seems that the brand machine is not suitable. People who don’t understand may encounter many problems when installing. 2. Strong plastic feeling. 
1	Absolutely genuine books, as long as you understand and thoroughly understand the contents of the three major books, and assist with some real questions, I believe that the exam will achieve excellent results~ It seems that the exam is not an IQ test, but an EQ test~ Very long The key to time preparation is persistence! It is hoped that all the comrades on the road of Si Kao will achieve victory in 2009. The best learning repetition is repetition, and the exam is just as useful. Read the book steadily. If you want to become a master, you have to live a life that is not human. The life of studying is hard. You have to be lonely, abandon all temptations, and read this book with confidence! 
1	The quality is okay, the screen is a bit unaccustomed at first, but after watching it for a long time, it feels very good! ! Anyway, the price is worth it! 
1	I have bought this book for two weeks, and I have finished reading the first few chapters of this book. It is relatively simple. I basically know how to shop and commonly used websites, etc.! I think the latter content is pretty good. For those of you who want to open a store on Taobao, it is still very good, but it is also very basic. Because I have studied PHOTOSHOP, it seems that it is not very laborious, but the content behind this book is enough to deal with The basic needs of opening a shop! There may be a lot of writing, but also for the sake of future generations. I hope you don’t think I am long-winded! Haha! 
0	The faucet is not broken, but it is so broken that you can't imagine, the water flow is very thin. Just checked in and found that there are things from the previous guest in the room. After the waiter cleaned the room, he knocked on the door again at night, saying that his own things had pulled the room. The speech was still very loud, and the room was facing the street again, and it was so noisy. Additional comments November 26, 2007: Swiping the card during registration, the result is not a pre-authorization, directly swiping consumption, but the amount of money or the amount of deposit is not the actual amount of staying in the hotel. When I checked out, the front desk took my card and swiped it up and down. After 10 minutes, I was told that it was not the card. I said that my card and my memory are fine, you let the foreman get it. After another ten minutes, the foreman came to take care of it. The hotel hardware is not good, and the service software is bad. 
0	The environment is very bad, there is no air conditioning, the room is dim and humid. I promise never to live again! ! ! 
0	I don’t know what the previous friends say, anyway, I feel really bad after moving in, CHAK IN 
0	"A great copy of the world’s articles. This book is too dogmatic and not practical at all. It’s better to read: How to say that children are willing to listen... Compared with ""how"", it is more interesting, practical, and more popular. I bought it A bunch of books in this area have the same content as ""how to"", so I will spend money on your behalf "
1	The keyboard is really good. I heard it all before. After I touched it with my hands, the response is really different~! 
1	Delivery is fast, and it will be delivered the next afternoon after placing the order. It should have not been dismantled, and I looked at it specially, and there is not even a fingerprint. Vista is also okay. It doesn't feel much slower than when the desktop is turned on; I like the bags I sent, and there are so many small bags that are very interesting. 
0	The room facilities are like a guest house. The equipment in the bathroom is very long and the room is in poor hygiene. Free registration Site navigation Hotel index Service description About Ctrip. 
0	The rooms are weird, the environment is average, the toilets are super-large, the beds are super-small, and the price is high. There is a service charge for delivery. 
1	In December, I booked a deluxe business suite in Jinquan. The internal environment of the room is good. The hotel is located on the edge of the city center and the surrounding traffic is fairly convenient. The taxi fare to Kunming's famous Golden Horse and Jade Chicken is just the starting price. The disadvantage is that Kunming diesel is tight, there is no air conditioning, and it is cold at night. Fortunately, I asked for an air-conditioning fan from the hotel to blow hot air, otherwise I would feel cold at night. 
0	It may be because of the different national conditions, or it may be that the expectations of this book are too high, so after roughing through the content, it feels quite twisted and there are too many dogma! Strong theory! 
1	When I was in college, I bought one of this book. Gein admired Dongpo's open-minded character and his poetry and prose. Ten years passed in a flash. Some time ago, I suddenly missed the biography of Dongpo in my home bookcase, so I bought another one, half for her husband and half for myself. Compared with the previous one, I really want to say that the design of this version is too fancy, the paper is too bad, the layout is too dense, especially, the translation is too unclear. It is because of disrespect to writers and writers. In any case, with the content and the author's insights, there are still flaws. This is Su Dongpo's own charm. 
1	From the standpoint of the machine alone, the price-performance ratio is good, but it is a failure to not send the bag. I will drop the price and send something after placing the order. I can’t accept this. 
1	The luxury business room is very large, but it is quite large and unreasonable. The hotel carpet is very dirty, stains can be seen everywhere, and there is lingering alcohol in the air. It is recommended that Ctrip visit Huayang Hotel, which is a step away, and many locals Friends recommended us to stay in Huayang. 
0	I really like Jack Ma on impulse and bought this book. After flipping through it, I found that it was really impulsive. It is an excerpt from the on-site reviews. Personal advice. 
1	I saw the comments from netizens saying that it is better not to have rooms on the 3rd and 5th floors, but unfortunately they are still designated as the 3rd floor. Ask the front desk. If you ask, it is still a question of nothing. The room facilities are average, the cold water in the washbasin is super small, only hot water is the big one, which makes my laundry super uncomfortable. The service was ok, the room attendant immediately gave us 3 more bottles of water after tipping. The biggest advantage of the hotel is that it is super close to DFS, big and small bags can be put back in the room and continue to go to other places. 
0	"It has been a month since I bought it back, but my son has only watched ""Gulu Gulu Zhuan"" once, and didn't even turn the other pages. The painting is too full and it looks a little messy, and the picture does not interest him. The book is too big to be easy to turn over. "
1	The rooms are quite comfortable, and the overall design and environment of the hotel are good. The front desk service is also very warm 
1	"I first watched ""And the World"", and then I found her, so I bought her and saw her, I really like the heroine's character that just do it if I like it and don't leave if I don't like it, a bit like Bai Fengxi, luckily she Leaving the place that restrained him early, although the cost was unbearable; if you like Yiyao, that means you like it if you like it, without any reason. In fact, when I watched ""And is the World"", I felt sorry for Yu's miss. Now I am really happy to see Yiyao's good results. "
1	Very beautiful notebook, very practical, and it runs very fast :) The colors are also very beautiful, I like it very much 
1	Read a lot of books that I want to save. This one feels the best, and always feels the best. Text, plot, characters, those intermittent memories, and the helpless reality of the moment. I like a woman like Jiaqi, who seems ordinary, but like a silent streamer. At certain subtle moments, the whole body is full of light. These are the few good novels I have ever read, romance novels. It reminds me of that phrase, in the dream, only Xu Tinghua and Yuezhi. Sometimes love is too beautiful and always intolerable, but those people, those things, those passing years, I know, I have always known, they were once real. 
0	This is a collection of novels. I have read many chapters and stories. The book printing is still good. But it is better to buy the whole set, a little regret. 
1	It’s not uncommon to get X200 at this price, but it’s hard to get a licensed X200 and there are so many gifts. Jingdong’s event is very good, praise 
0	Very poor service. The rooms and beds are relatively small. The double room was originally divided into single bed and double bed. When booking, it must be added that it is a double bed, otherwise it will become a single bed. 
0	The decoration is avant-garde, but it is definitely not refined enough, and even vulgar in it, it is not good to watch! Including the lobby and the room, I didn't pay attention, I thought I had entered a KTV with insufficient decoration. The room feels dirty! Low cost performance! 
0	1. The temperature of the air outlet is high and others are not hot. 2. The random driver is vista, without xp, it is inconvenient. 3. No 1394! 4. Express is changed from pcmcia, and the mold is not moved to save costs, despise! 5. Short standby, 110 document editing, 80 high definition. 
0	There is less focus and more nonsense, and more personal feeling. This is the reason for the length of the book. There are too many unrealistic things in it. If we are so rich, wouldn’t we protect ourselves? Everything is nonsense. , Anyone can write such a book. 
0	I don't like this hotel, it feels very different from its star rating: 1. Without a doorman, no one will come to help you carry your luggage. 2. The front desk was indifferent and the tone was too blunt. 3. I just checked in and wrote my room number wrong, causing me to run up and down with my luggage. 4. Self-talking about canceling my colleague's order, Ctrip came forward to negotiate with no results, very tough. 5. The lobby is too small, so some computers have been set up to let people surf the Internet. Some people who are not like hotel guests surf the Internet there, like an Internet cafe. 6. I thought I was smart and launched a lot of so-called services, but generally we don't use them. On the contrary, it can't give guests a warm feeling at all. 7. Relative to its service, this price is too expensive! I really don't know how such a hotel will survive after the Olympics. . . 
0	I don’t know how the hotel distinguishes between double bed and standard room? ? ? The bed is about the same size as the bed in an ordinary standard room. It is said that the business room is arranged on the first floor. How can business guests rest at ease? ? 
0	Because of the disclosure, they are all fake medical scientists, which made me feel very disappointed. I wanted to learn something for my own use. I didn’t expect that after I bought it, I found it was fake and I didn’t want to return it, but I still hope after thinking about it. So unscrupulous authors or publishers do less of these wicked things 
1	The hotel was originally equipped with a super 5-star hardware configuration. I have lived in 2001-2006, and the price has dropped a lot! Location too far is fatal 
1	"The first time I read ""Men Di"" was serialized in a newspaper, and it was also the first time I read Lian Jian's novel. From watching the first episode, I was deeply attracted by it. In fact, many of the stories, plots and scenes in it happened to ourselves, but we let out a sigh of helplessness after thinking deeply, and then continue to live. Of course, after the passage, we will continue to develop, things will not go badly, the sun will rise eastward every day, and the gentle evening breeze will arrive as scheduled. Life is like this. "
1	I found this set of books in the library. After I watched the first episode, I couldn’t stop it. I bought the full set of books in Dangdang so that I can read it a few more times in the future. The writing is really good. The description of ancient military should be It's relatively professional, and it's the first time I have been exposed to these things. What impressed me the most was the description of Yuan Chonghuan. After that, I went to check the comments in this area. It was indeed very different from my previous knowledge. After reading a lot of information, I was still biased towards Yuan Chonghuan’s statement that Yuan Chonghuan was a minister of misunderstanding , Which is to steal what the author said. 
1	This book needs to be read carefully, read it again and again to better understand the secret. I think the problems the protagonist encounters are often our own problems, but we seldom reveal it to outsiders, so we suppress many things in our hearts. Fortunately, she met a wise man. I am also a lost lamb who needs this kind of guidance. There are many changes in life, often because of trivial things that make you feel bad. I think this depressing peptide has taken root in me. I also hope to watch it several times and enjoy life. 
0	"A book with no content and no particular point of view. It's nothing more than a simple piece of story, plus a few empty sermons, which is boring. If you have to buy it, it is recommended that those under 16 can try it. Those over the age of 16 are exempted. We should have already experienced and understood what it says. If you haven't experienced it yet, then believe me, reading this book will not change you or anything. The most quintessential part of the book is the preface written by Chen Yalin, which is far more true. ""Please be loyal to your own happiness"" is the only sentence that left an impression on me. "
0	The decoration of the room is really not flattering, there is still water under the washbasin, and it is four stars.I think that the three stars may be bought with money, and it is not as good as Jinjiang Star, Home Inn and other hotels.

1	"As soon as my friend said that the ruffian Cai had published a new book, he immediately searched for relevant information online and read ""Looking Back"" intermittently on the Internet, but still bought the book. I still like to hold the actual book to read, rather than holding the mp4 to the computer. It can be said that I grew up looking at the book of the ruffian Cai. When I was in junior high school, I secretly watched ""The First Intimate Contact"" in class. Until now, I still like the work after graduation. I have to say that we are growing up, and the ruffian Cai is also growing up. In addition to his past characteristics, ""Looking Back"" seems to be about life, beliefs and so on. It is worth taking a closer look. "
1	The title page says: I can’t wait for you for a year and a month, and I can’t wait for you to be twenty-five, but I will wait for you for a lifetime... There is an ominous feeling that what will happen to the hero and heroine Good thing. So keep it at the beginning, don't get too involved in it. However, the simple description, the meticulous depiction, the contradictions and struggles in the characters' hearts are almost imprinted on the bones, how can we not invest! ! ! The most unforgettable love is often a tragedy with no ending...I am not at this injustice, but I am grateful for the long-lasting soul-stirring that Amy can bring to me... 
1	It's quite a good hotel. Although it is a bit old, the scenery on the two banks of the Pujiang River is not comprehensive, because the 17th floor is not high enough, and the Seagull Hotel is blocked in front. It may be more than 23 to see it all, but At least the Bund can be seen very comprehensively. From the Waibaidu Bridge to the Bund direction of Jinling Road, it is beautiful. The hotel is very quiet. It is really quiet and quiet. It is good, suitable for vacation and feels like home. The equipment is old because of its age. Obsolescence is inevitable, but the room is very large, with a study, living room, kitchen, very good, next time you see the most beautiful Bund in Shanghai will come to live. 
0	"To be honest, I feel there is a certain amount of work. But there is also a lot of nonsense, and there are wheel words. Perhaps it is a common problem with publications in this era. If it were written as ""Those Things in the Ming Dynasty"". It is estimated to shrink by at least 30%. Entry-level TCM acupuncture theory. It's still worth seeing. Personally think it is worth to be online. Not worth buying "
1	Reading the introduction on Dangdang.com on Xiaodoudou looking for his purse in the toilet, I was immediately attracted by Xiaodoudou's cute image, and was even more moved by President Zongsaku Xiaolin. He thought he was amazing, so I bought it immediately. It took two days to read it and my wife liked it very much. After reading it, we recommended it to relatives and friends around to share this beautiful childhood of Xiao Doudou. No matter how old you are, if you still have a childlike innocence, like to remember the past, and still maintain a yearning for purity in your heart, then this book is definitely worth reading! Because everyone can find their sunny childhood in this book. 
0	This is the most rubbish home I have ever seen. The front desk service is decent, but the room is completely unacceptable. From the elevator out of the floor, the corridors and even the rooms have an unpleasant smell, just like the smell of waste oil. Open the windows The smell has not disappeared for an hour, making people dizzy and headache uncomfortable. Later, we asked the front desk to change rooms and floors for us. After the change, the smell was relatively reduced, but there was still a little smell that lingered. We slept with the windows and air-conditioning open all night, and we left the room at dawn the next day. Thinking about it now, I feel terrible~! Staying there for a long time can make people feel uncomfortable and nauseous like motion sickness! 
0	There was a lot of thunder and rain, and I wanted to buy some good books for my children. I found this book was well evaluated, but it turned out to be rubbish, which is not the case at all. It is absolutely worthless for 6 cents a page! 
1	It seems to be in a company with Hongyadong Hotel, so the style of the room is similar, but smaller. Overall it is good. The food in the room is free, which is very real. The breakfast is really not flattering, the lobby environment is relatively poor. Overall it's good, a good three-star hotel. 
0	Compared with the 2140, the screen is not a mirror screen, and the brightness will be a little bit worse. The appearance of the speaker part is different from the website picture. There are too many models in the HP MIni series. There is a speaker part that bulges outwards and is metal mesh. I always thought it was that kind, but I was a little surprised when I arrived. 
0	I just came back from Wuyi today, especially the new Yumingzhao Hot Spring International Hotel I arrived at around 1/12:00. When I checked in, I was told that the business double room we booked was gone, and only standard rooms were left. . (Because it was booked on Ctrip, so the money has been paid) After that, our team leader and their sales staff checked the order and found out that we did book a business double room, and let us wait for half a time After many hours, we finally gave us the room where others had just left. Afterwards, due to cleaning, we waited outside the door for more than 20 minutes before finally entering the room. 2/ Because there is a hot spring arrangement at 19:00 in the evening, I want to settle the dinner earlier. Call the room service at 17:20, the service staff said that there is no room service during this time. I thought it might be busy during the holiday season, so I didn't care. Then we went straight to the restaurant and ordered the dishes at 17:30 until the first one was served one hour later. There were also one or two empty plates on the tables of other guests, and there was no sign of serving. In the meantime, I urged the young lady several times and ignored her. Because I was in a hurry, I had to go to the kitchen, urging them to deliver a dish, and then put it on the table. At this time, it was almost seven o'clock, and we decided to pay the bill, and don't let the other dishes that were not served, even if the stomach was still empty. After that, the young lady inside was carrying dishes from an unknown source, asking questions one by one at the table. The chaos of the scene was really laughable. 3/ The water temperature in the bathroom is unstable. Either it was very hot and suddenly became very cold without touching the halter. These factors directly affect our mood during the trip. As a four-star hotel, it is hard to imagine that its service is like this. I hope it can be improved! 
1	The location of the hotel is convenient, the service is good, and the room we booked includes shuttle service, which is very affordable. The disadvantage is that the room is small, and the Hong Kong funeral home below 
0	My child loves it. The painting is beautiful and wonderful. Suitable for babies over 1 year old to understand. My children hum a birthday song when they see a little bear’s birthday; when they see a little gorilla laughing at someone’s bedwetting, they will learn to cover their mouths and laugh; when they see a little rabbit crying with an open mouth because of falling ice cream, they will Laugh; see the big mouth of the little hippo, I will touch it very much. . . There are countless such interesting reading moments. This set of books is good. However, in the process of reading, children can't understand it right away, and parents need to patiently speak over and over again. Ha ha. . . 
1	The hotel is okay, the lady at the front desk is very enthusiastic. There are many shops and restaurants around. The downside is that the hotel's karaoke12 shop is off work, can not go to bed early, the room is very close to the opposite building, and the curtains must be drawn. 
0	Generally speaking, I am not very satisfied with this hotel. 1. The front desk service is terrible. It is said that it was a computer system problem, which caused the check-in for more than half an hour, and always ignored it; 2. After check-in, I found the room was not cleaned in time, and urged it several times; 3. White sheets and pillowcases They all turned yellow. According to the cleaning staff, the bleached ones are white; 4. I waited for a long time when I checked out. 5. The room type booked when I checked in was gone, and I had to pay for the upgrade. . . It is free to upgrade only after reasonable efforts. This situation did not happen in the Wuding Road house. 
0	I bought a leaflet that says the recommended retail price is 200$, I don’t know why it’s so expensive in China/ 
1	This mobile phone is good, but the system cannot be partitioned. I used the restore button in my hand, and now the screen is black. What should I do? 
1	Although many people say that this book describes serious facts in simple words, I think that even though it involves war, it is not all heavy. Behind the war, you can see a warm and harmonious family, a wise and kind mother, a simple big Joe, a sane and strong Charlie, and a gentle and lovely Jasmine. The shadow of war looms over the society, but people's hearts are quiet. This is why we really love this book. As the author wants to do, this is a short and easy-to-understand book, but every word is very important. The packaging is very good and I like the illustrations very much. I hope everyone will have a chance to see it. 
0	Originally I planned to stay for four days, but later changed to Lushan Hotel for two days. Hotel feel: Disadvantages: the room is damp, the decoration is outdated, especially the bathroom, the door is almost (door frame to door frame) facing the public bathroom, smelly! Very poor sound insulation, remote and inconvenient transportation. Advantages: free broadband Internet access. It is worth mentioning the restaurant: the price is more expensive, but the attitude is good. One night when the lights were turned off, we went in and cooked for us, although the variety was not much. Compare with Lushan Hotel. Xiaoxia Hotel Lushan Hotel is located in a remote location. It takes 30-40 minutes to walk to the street. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the street. There are almost no taxis. The opposite is Meilu. There is a car at any time. The surrounding environment is good and the room facilities are good. Generally, older, latex paint has peeled off, newer, clean wallpaper, bathroom is very old, feel dirty, clean, hotel environment is average, lobby floor tiles are average, lobby carpet sound insulation is very poor and good broadband Internet access has no small standard, large standard part

1	1. The screen looks good, the colors are saturated and bright! From the HPV3009 I bought in 2006 to now, I always feel that HP's screen is very good. 2. Many technical parameters comment that AMD's QL64 has poor performance, but I feel that it is quite fast. Watching PPS, playing QQ games, and installing software at the same time, it feels not slow. However, there is no database installed to check the processing performance. I feel that the home is enough. 4. HP's heat dissipation is excellent, without the air conditioner, running for six hours continuously, installing the machine, installing the software, test machine, GHOST, no heat, of course the air outlet The temperature is very high, which proves that HP's heat dissipation is very good 
1	I have always been in awe of philosophy. I have tried to read a few philosophy books and I often give up halfway after reading a little because it is too profound and obscure. It is said that philosophy comes from life. After all, it is higher than life. Maybe my life experience is limited and the depth of thinking is not enough. In short, philosophy is a word that makes me admire and headache. Because this book is in the form of illustrations, it should feel more vivid. I didn’t expect that although it explained the background and source of Sartre’s thoughts, it was still quite difficult to understand. It can only be said to be a good book of enlightenment. As for the deep understanding, it is still There are a lot of books to read, a long way to go. . . . 
1	After seeing the comments of many netizens, I stayed in this hotel with a sense of anxiety. After I checked in, I wanted to objectively vindicate it and let everyone share the good things:) Jiayuguan is a small city, this hotel is probably The best hotel in the city. The free airport pick-up service of the hotel I am most satisfied with, after all, I came to a relatively unfamiliar environment, and being able to receive someone makes me feel safe. The hotel concierge and waiter are very enthusiastic, Jiayuguan is really cold compared to Guangdong, but the hotel is very warm. The room is more comfortable and very clean. The weather in Jiayuguan is relatively dry, and the room is equipped with a humidifier. This is more humane, taking into account those of us who live in the south. Regarding breakfast, I think it’s very good. There are many varieties. The ones upstairs are open until nine o’clock, but I went there for more than nine o’clock that day, and I still have some food. Seeing the upstairs, I can’t help but say a few words for it, hehe, maybe the service still has room for improvement, but there is no doubt that such a city cannot be compared with a big city like Beijing and Shanghai. I think they are simple Enthusiasm has filled up some of the shortcomings in their hardware, after all, everyone in the Northwest is very clear. If I come here again, I will choose to live here, and I will also introduce my friends here, ^_^, objective is not objective, or I will find out by trying it myself, this is my experience^_^, if you go to Jiayuguan, remember to eat The lamb skewers are pretty good and cheap. It's interesting to go to the castle tower and have a look. This is a digression^_^ 
0	It’s a bit hot, but it’s tolerable. I’m not satisfied with the keyboard. I think the color brightness of the display is a bit high. What’s the reason? 
0	It is not the rainy season, but it still has a strong musty smell. The quilt was cold and humid, the air conditioner was not turned on, and there was no heating equipment. Without anyone in line, the checkout took at least 15 minutes. After the two cashiers made a phone call for a ward round, they started chatting on their own. It was not until a long time later, after receiving feedback from the ward round, that they looked for pre-authorized information absently with an expression of not awake. Print bills and find invoices. Don’t the employees of our store know that the corridor of their own store is the longest corridor in history, and it takes a long time to walk through the rounds? After repeated reminders, I reluctantly called to urge the results of the rounds, and didn't know how to find out the bills first. People have to think about whether they did not receive the year-end award. Tomorrow morning someone will receive meal coupons at the entrance of the restaurant. After they are seated, someone will come up and ask if they have meal coupons, so as to save others. Additional comments February 21, 2008: I forgot one thing: Recently, slippers were replaced with non-disposable ones. I really doubt whether there is any real disinfection. Because the whole hotel feels moldy, old and not so refreshing. If they have athlete's foot, they are the number one suspect. 
1	Very good machine, very beautiful! It's right to buy a computer from Lenovo! Classic mold; stable performance; low noise; LED screen; workmanship is much better than ASUS! To be honest, I am not Lenovo's trust. 
1	The appearance of thinkpad is just like that. This notebook is light enough, strong in performance, and very convenient to carry around! 
0	It’s easy for a person to be famous, but a gentleman who loves money needs to make a good way. A book with only 100,000 characters costs 20 yuan. It’s too dark, plus the book is very large, there are many empty pages, and the words are not enough, but I still use the painting to make up, what is this? He kept saying that he wanted to learn from Confucius, and he was also a good dragon man.

1	"I like Shenxue. Actually, I like the imagination of this woman. Because of her imagination, love is less tender and cruel in her writing. I read this book, not as amazing as it was at the beginning. His moves are not surprising. To be honest, the beginning is really boring, the eyes full of ""Tiffany"", really boring, almost the line of Guo Jingming. To be honest, compared to the previous story, I can only say that it is unsatisfactory, about the level of 2-3 stars. However, I like the ending so much. I just go around for this ending because of the ending. "
0	The location is acceptable, very close to the Confucian Temple of Confucius Mansion, you can walk there. The environment is too bad, the quality of the waiters is very poor, the room does not even have clothes hangers. The price is not attractive, and it is far worse than the International Youth Hostel 20 meters away. Not only is the price cheap, but it is also clean and tidy. You can meet some self-guided travel companions, and you can also do laundry. It is recommended that Ctrip cancel the cooperation with this hotel, which will affect Ctrip's reputation.

1	I have been looking forward to it for a long time and have compared a lot. I wanted to buy a Samsung NC10, and I was fancy this keyboard, so I placed an order. I want to buy a notebook to make it easy to access the Internet. I usually use it for blogging, so the keyboard and battery life are the first choices. The happiest thing is that my friend helped install WINDOWS7, the interface is very beautiful! In addition, I have a keyboard membrane, a small bag, a small mouse, and of course a small table for the bed! Very pleasant! My favorite is that you can read the SD card and upload the PP at any time when traveling. 
0	There is currently a doubt: press the leftmost power button to turn on, and press the touch point next to it to turn on, why? 
0	The purpose of buying this book is to let the baby know what can't be done, and to educate the baby with this kid as a typical negative. Unexpectedly, the baby’s reaction was fear, and I regretted buying it for 23.8. The book is big and the pictures are big, but David's paintings are not cute at all, and he often grinned to fill the whole picture; and the color is not the color that 2-year-olds like, I think it is a bit disgusting. After only 5 pages were told to the baby, the baby said that he was afraid and did not want to read it. I can't comment in vain that this book is not good, I can only say that it is not suitable for a 2-year-old child like my baby who is less courageous and yearns for happy and beautiful things. 
1	The location is excellent, the rooms and services are good. The mung bean soup delivered at night, as well as paper cranes and greeting cards, felt like a monk. Will stay here next time. Hotel Feedback June 25, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of the Ambassador Hotel. We are very willing to be your friends. Welcome to stay often! I wish you all the best and a happy mood.

0	Due to work, I have stayed many times. The room and hotel facilities are old and the service is not good. I forgot the shampoo in the room twice. I didn’t remind me during the rounds. I waited a few days to ask. Said it could not be found. Not every room has broadband, so you must make a request when opening a room. The breakfast quality is relatively poor, and the breakfast for 15 yuan is nothing.

1	According to my friend, this hotel has a shabby exterior but a luxurious interior decoration. The service is absolutely good. From getting off the bus, entering the room, and then checking out, there are very professional waiters at the reception. Help me take my luggage, send it to the room, turn on the air conditioner, turn on the lights, and make tea. . . . . . And insist on not tipping! I live in a special big room, which is very good. I will definitely stay here when I go to Fuzhou. Very comfortable, very spacious, free 3 hours domestic long distance, computer free Internet access, and complete games, very fast. 
0	Hotels should pay attention to software construction! Especially the front desk! ! We went to check in and told us that there is no our name and the room is now full. After checking for a long time, I told you to change to Jinjiang. I went to Jinjiang to see the room and went back to swipe the card after agreeing. The lady at the front desk was arrogant: We found it, this time it is your own fault! Not the responsibility of the hotel! You are late, so we cancelled the reservation. Say the name using your partner's name. 
0	The fan's voice is a bit loud and the call is intermittent. When I put it together with my husband's Dell notebook, I feel that my notebook is very noisy. I don't know if this is a common phenomenon or an individual case. But it may be that the sound of the fan is loud enough, so the heat dissipation is very good, and other problems have not been found yet. 
0	"Once the water was cut off, it was said to be an emergency. The attitude is quite bad. Two bananas and two apples in the ""fruit basket"" were delivered the next day as an apology. It is recommended not to choose a room near the elevator, there is a service phone at the door, the room is very poorly insulated and very noisy. The two places for breakfast can only score 60 points. The taxi is called now. The service telephone in the corridor on the 14th floor is dirty. "
0	"I think when I buy a book, I must first consider what effect it can bring to me and whether I can learn what I want to learn. After reading this book, I feel that Lala’s personality is very similar to mine. , The essence is relatively simple, kind, and stubborn, but maybe I am not as hard-working and brave as her, nor as ""hard-hearted"" as she is. I must fight for what I want. I also hate the overly complicated interpersonal struggles in society. My way is generally to choose ""escape"" or ignore it.............Haha! All in all, this book is worth learning for women who want to mix in the workplace, ha ha. "
0	It's not as good as the comments say. Very general, the text feels bad, and it does not reflect the unique beauty of that era. 
0	The room is OK, but the attitude of the front desk staff can’t stand it. I went to the hotel CHEK IN at 11pm and checked out the next day and said that there was a small square in my room and asked me to pay 5 yuan. pitiful! From entering the room to checking out, I only saw a small square towel on the bathroom countertop! For 5 yuan, I negotiated with the deputy manager in the lobby. There was no way. Who told me to go in without checking carefully. Are there any things in the room? Forget it, what about giving them 5 yuan, but I will never stay in this hotel again! I advise everyone who is going to stay in the store, after entering the room, be sure to check if there is anything missing, because Hyde can't be wrong, they have checked it 3 times! so funny! 
1	I bought it at a special promotion, but I didn't expect the price to be reduced. The keyboard feels good, the performance is good, and the battery life is worth mentioning, almost 8 hours, which is really amazing. 
1	The hotel is very nice and cost-effective. Although in the bustling section of Luoyang, I had a very quiet rest at night and I slept well. At the same time, it is more convenient to go to Longmen. There are buses, and you can reach Longmen for about 24 yuan by taxi. 
0	This kind of hotel is actually five-star, I don't know how to rate it. The sense of service was poor. When I checked into the hotel, I carried two large boxes and went in, but the door did not move. I booked a double room, and I was given a double room. It was called a double bed. The space was so small that I complained to the front desk but no results. So I complained to Ctrip. Finally Long class. Old, I won't talk about this, others have already written it. It takes a long time to eat. I ordered a fruit plate, a simple fruit plate, and it took an hour to come up. In short, will not live again next time.

1	Looking at the picture, you will feel that the shape is terrible, but the actual style you get is very beautiful. Although it is not a classic model, it is generous in workmanship and expensive. It is very good for office or home use. High cost performance 
0	I stayed at this hotel on July 22, because I made a reservation on Ctrip.com, and it was quite fast to check in at the front desk. It's just that the hardware of the hotel is really unsatisfactory, and it is not directly proportional to the price. I chose this hotel with the attitude of investigating the hotel, and it turned out that something very irritating really happened. I would like to show everyone here: The room I lived in was a six-story suite, and the door needed a lot of force. The shower head in the bathroom in the bedroom seems to be rusty, and there is not much water coming out. Since I work as a hotel, I have to check the linen by myself when I check out and then call the housekeeping department to ask them to come and check the room. This can reduce my check-out time. I remember very clearly at the time: there was a small square in the toilet outside, I used it and put it on the tray, I hadn’t touched other toiletries; there were two small squares in the bathroom in the bedroom (one on the bedside table, One is placed on the marble countertop of the bathroom) When the CHECK OUT arrived, the housekeeper claimed that a square towel was missing. I said that I was at the front desk and had not left the shop. Either you search my bag or check out for me. You can't put unnecessary charges on me! The front desk insisted not to check out for me, and no assistant manager in the lobby came forward to coordinate this matter. Because I had to attend the banquet at noon, I could only compensate the hotel with 10 yuan for the loss of the scarf. Ten yuan is a small matter, but the way the hotel handles problems is a big deal. What the hotel does is hardware and software services. It is really worrying for your hotel to solve the problem like this~ Please be cautious when choosing this hotel, because it is very likely that due to the carelessness of the housekeeper, you will shirk your responsibility. On the guests, there is no way to prove the results, the guests can only eat coptis! If you must stay in a hotel, I recommend the Home Inn on Taoyuan Road and the Home Inn on Beiqi Square. The price is high, the service is very good, and the breakfast is varied and delicious! 
1	Thin and light, the CPU is powerful enough, and the included memory is okay to run Vista. I am hesitant to change to XP. Be prepared to find a Bluetooth module and install it-wait until the warranty is over. 
0	The comments are so hot, I thought it was a good book, but the result can be said to be a free book, with no content, empty, general...a hundred spent my money! You can’t read this kind of book if you want to learn about Chinese medicine Nothing written! 
1	"I just received the book today and read it. The quality of the book is very good and worth it. The content of the book also has three characteristics as mentioned in the introduction: viewing the Three Kingdoms from the official history; learning ancient prose; and biographies of the characters of the three kingdoms. The five thousand years of Chinese civilization has many excellent traditions that we should inherit. Learning history, learning excellent history and culture, is a quality that we Chinese should have. This is what we should be proud of and proud of as a Chinese. No matter how the history and society change, the Chinese should not forget the ""foundation"", which is the unique cultural tradition of the Chinese nation, the soul of the Chinese nation! "
0	It has been renovating since last year. It is said that it will be upgraded to 4 stars, and the room is still the same. At 8:30 in the evening, the construction site rigs and excavators for the hotel’s expansion began to scream. When I fell asleep, it should be past 10 o’clock~ I was still working. I wanted to take photos, but the construction site did not turn on the headlights. Only the small lights on the machine cannot shoot. After taking a bath, I couldn't get water out of the shower head, so I could only get water out of the tap below. People were too tired because they were already ‘dishessed’, so I didn’t look for a guest room. Ctrip called me at noon the next day and asked if I would be staying. It probably meant that the hotel did not say that I was staying. It was too irresponsible. Please also Ctrip can go and see what is going on when signing a hotel contract in the future. The situation in Longyou Hotel is really inferior to those small hotels in Longyou! ! ! I live in a 403 can be verified! ! ! 
0	1 The air outlet has a large heat, which dissipates heat more than other models; it is very difficult to install, and it is still not good to turn off the sata. It is finally done. 3 The driver is not easy to install, but the order is basically no problem. 
1	"In fact, I don’t particularly like Mark Twain’s short stories, except for this ""Million Pounds"". When I was young, I saw the movie starring Gregorian Peck. I think it’s the most classic. I gave this CD as a gift. I really like it. I bought the whole book for it. But it’s okay to look at novels. It’s not the same as movies and other novels. I haven't read it~~Inconvenient comments, the quality of the book is also okay, can't ask too much~~ "
1	The 11-inch screen looks much better than the 8.9-inch screen. The volume is not very large, the weight is a little heavier, and it is still convenient to carry. It is not particularly troublesome to modify the system, but a lot of time is wasted by hard disk formatting and repartitioning. The endurance is very strong, there is no problem with 7 hours of continuous use. It belongs to the mid to high-end level of the mainstream configuration of the netbook. The price is relatively affordable. 
0	I haven't read Naoko Takagi's book before. I always heard that it was good. I finally bought one this time. Maybe she's not used to her style, she doesn't like it very much, the content is a bit tedious and lacks the feeling of having a smile after reading it. A bit disappointed. 
0	Although the author is not a professional medical staff, he can be regarded as a doctor! The content of this book is full of self-boosting and swelling. I think this should not be the subject of the book and what the readers need in the first place! The simplicity of this book is a major feature, but it has a major hidden danger in itself-it does not take into account the differences in the physical constitution, regional climate, and habits of the readers involved, and uses a single model to solve all problems. The problem is obviously undesirable! I purchased this book because of Dangdang’s recommendation rankings, but it didn’t take long to read it. At least I couldn’t agree with it. I hope that the author, as a doctor, will be clear and understandable and understandable for readers. While complimenting the self, it also does not forget to spread its differences and basic knowledge so that readers can correctly and conveniently grasp the knowledge that is beneficial to them. It won't be a thousand miles away because of the slightest loss, I think this should be the original intention of the author! 
0	The 8.9-inch shell is the same size as the 10.1 shell, which does not reflect a large panel area on the outer ring of the 8.9-inch screen. 
0	I booked the Juchuan Holiday Hotel through Ctrip. I checked in the night of March 17, 2008 (because I have to see customers the next day). I don’t often go to Tanggu for business trips. This is the second time. The first time I stayed with the boss Juchuan International Business Hotel can not say much. This time I took a colleague to live in Juchuan Holiday. Let’s talk about my experience: When I arrive at the hotel at about 9 o’clock in the evening, the front desk formalities are complete. Very neat, but when I arrived at the room 401 (the situation of my colleague living in 402 is similar), I opened the door and a nauseous smell came to my face. I called the waiter and said it was the smell of air freshener. I have never smelled this kind of air freshener that smells like rotten sweet potatoes, rotten, and moldy. It was still cold. I had no choice but to open the window. The smell could not dissipate for a long time. I had to open the window all night, but I opened it when it was too cold. Central air conditioner, but this air conditioner is like a tractor roaring in your ears. I'm completely dizzy. The house is next to the road, and there is no soundproofing. I can hear the sound of a large car all night. Instead of such a smelly noise, why don't I just sleep on the road? So I asked myself this stupid question all night, until dawn to add one point: the towels provided in the bathroom are hard and can be used as foot pads. The only comfort is that when I complained to the service desk, I answered the phone very well. Repeatedly said that the smell in the room is not what we can do, prompting me to open the window for ventilation. Since other houses are so smelly, my heart is somewhat balanced, but I will never come again next time to make an appeal. The comment is definitely not my malicious slander, it is really personal experience. I am a salesperson and often run everywhere. I think that the environmental requirements are not high, as long as it is clean and convenient, I would like to advise friends who come to Tanggu for business trips not to live in Juchuan Holiday. 
0	1. The up and down viewing angle of the LED is too small, and the left and right viewing angles are good; 2. The built-in speaker has a low sound and poor sound quality; 3. The sound of the fan is too loud; 4. The built-in Vista system is too rubbish and has no meaning; 5 .The plastic feel is too strong, it feels relatively low-end 
1	This is a very good three-star hotel. The room facilities, the service quality of the waiters, and the attitude are very good, but the difference between the agreed price of Ctrip and the front desk price of the hotel is not much, I hope Ctrip will continue to work hard. 
0	Scheduled to check in at 12 noon and arrive at around 11:30 noon and inform that the room is being cleaned. I wondered how long it would take to clean the room, so I waited patiently. Unexpectedly, I asked about the room again at 12:30 and the room was still not cleaned up. I was anxious to ask when I could move in. After 40 minutes, I almost fainted. 
0	PC card slot 1 x Express expansion card slot why I can’t find it! ! ! ! ! Only the four-in-one sd card slot... Another thing is that Samsung's CD-ROM drive is very poor, picking up the disk, and several system disks are not recognized. Samsung is not just bad 
1	The environment of the hotel is very good, but because of the surrounding roads, the traffic in and out of the city is quite severe. The facilities in the room are good, but the maintenance of individual details needs to be improved. 
1	"I can’t help but say a few more words. Most of the content in this book is based on other books, such as P37. The content is based on ""Metal Cutting Machine Tools"". It is marked with ab, and I don’t know what it is, nor is it explained in the text. There are too many books for similar things. I suspect (I doubt it, there is no evidence) that this book is the editor grasping the overall framework, the teacher will organize the material and the graduate students. Few people did overall reading afterwards. If the guess is not wrong, the third edition is likely to have these problems. Wait and see. "
1	"The location of the hotel is good, facing Yuandang Lake, this time I stayed in Room 01, with windows on both sides, you can see the sea while watching the lake, especially the night view of Yuandang Lake, very beautiful. The facilities are a bit old. After all, it was opened in 1999, but there are free fruits and free mineral water in the room; the LED electronic screen at the entrance is very eye-catching and beautiful; the 6F gym and swimming pool are free for hotel guests. The quality and service of the staff are very good. A porter will greet you as soon as you enter the hotel. The waiters at the reception and guest rooms are also very enthusiastic. When checking out, the guest relations director also took the initiative to ask about the feelings of staying in the hotel, solicit opinions, and feel I listened very much to the customer relations director saying that it will be renovated at the end of the year, and I look forward to it... The breakfast included in the room price is very rich, with many varieties and good taste. It’s worth more than 400 yuan. I added 20 yuan and chose a discount for ""180 minutes of domestic long-distance calls every day"". After a long call, it’s only 20 yuan. Direct dialing is cheaper than IP phones and saves a lot. Long domestic calls! When I checked in, there happened to be a wedding banquet, and the lobby was crowded with people coming and going. It was very lively. I heard there were dozens of tables of guests. Choose this next time! "
1	Before I checked in, I was still a little disturbed after reading the reviews above. After moving in, I feel okay. In Wuhu this place, it should be said that it is good to be able to live in such a hotel. Will choose this hotel in Wuhu in the future. 
1	I stayed at this hotel when it opened in 1998 and I felt very good. I chose to live here when I went to Qingdao this year. Ten years have passed, although the hardware is slightly outdated, I still feel very satisfied with the service level. 
1	The hotel is not up to date, but the rooms and services are very good. Because of the geographical location, the taxi is not as convenient as the hotel facing the street. The hotel staff and doormen are very enthusiastic and meticulous, and thoughtfully introduce customers to the most suitable travel methods and routes. It feels very good. 
1	"I have two dogs, and when I watched Xiao Q, I cried so badly. Somehow I still have the courage to read this book. The story is vivid and touching. The puppy socks in the story are also very cute, but I see it very slowly, and seem a little reluctant to read it, and I am afraid of seeing the end of the story. This is the end that every dog owner doesn't want to face. In fact, one day I really couldn’t hold back. I took a peek at the end and couldn’t cry myself. Haha I found that Dangdang had two versions of ""The Promise"". After comparing them, this version seems to be based on dialogue, with a slightly simpler plot. , The other one seems to be more beautiful. "
0	"Some examples are not typical enough, and they may be used to fill the number. I hope to see some less naive and obvious Chinglish (in general, people who have studied English a little will not make the low-level mistakes mentioned in the book), and should write some Similar to the ""jokes"" caused by cultural differences, such as blue stories, most people only know that blue means sadness, but in fact it has become the meaning of pornographic novels. In terms of typesetting, the book still has some merits, it looks relaxed, and some are still more funny. "
0	The pre-installed software has expired. It turns out to be in 2006. Where is the Bluetooth switch? 
0	The room is close to the road and it is too noisy. I heard the sound of the car at night and heard the dawn. Check out in the morning was slow 
1	"""Love"" is the theme of humanity. Sometimes it is complicated and difficult to understand. After reading this book, I saw that love is indeed everywhere. However, in many cases, it has become helpless. It’s not that ‘he/she’ doesn’t love you, but just doesn’t know how to let you know that ‘ta’ is loving you. If you want to be happy, I do not recommend you to read this book. If you want to become strong after a little worry, this book is highly recommended. I admire Teacher Liu's book and his philosophy. Of course, not all are applicable, but it will not be a waste of time to read it. "
1	The overall performance is good, playing Warcraft is not stuck at all, fingerprint recognition is very convenient, with a camera and microphone, easy to chat, plus 1 yuan to get a wireless router. 
0	The upper left corner of the keyboard is severely sinking when you press it slightly. Alas, the workmanship is not flattering. The effect is very different from the small black keyboard I used before. No wonder everyone on the Internet does not admit that the SL series belongs to tinkpad 
0	It is hard to believe that this is a 3-star hotel recommended by Ctrip! I stayed in a single room for 5 days, and the price was 240 yuan/night. During the period, I learned about the Sinopec test question bank meeting, and the price was 160 yuan/day. The carpet in the room hasn't been cleaned and dusted for N dry years. It looks dark, all kinds of spots, stains, and small holes are very uncomfortable. (The carpet in the aisle is slightly better) The first night was arranged on the second floor, and then adjusted to the 5th floor. The sound insulation was not good. The guests next door returned to the room at 2pm, the door was closed and the TV sounded loudly. The bathroom has glass windows, but they cannot be opened. Plastic curtains are smaller than the window area, so ladies should be careful to expose them. The sewer in the room where I live is not smooth. Every time the stagnant water has to pass the instep, it is very sick! The restaurant is outsourced. A (example) beef tenderloin with pepper is 30 yuan, and a shredded pork with fish flavor is 20 yuan. The price here may only be closer to the 3-star standard. The 5-day breakfast buffet is almost always a soup noodle plus 1-2 omelettes, because there are hardly any flavors to choose from. Because of the meeting, I basically left early and returned late. When I left the store on the last day, I discovered that the sheets I had been padding had several footprints on it! Some of the front desk attendants are kind, some are cold, and cannot be generalized. 
0	The equipment is very simple and the sense of service is very poor. The facilities of the restaurant are just like the beach on the street, and the sanitary conditions are very poor. 
1	Her poems seem ordinary but extremely beautiful, but they seem ordinary but can resonate in your heart! What a wonderful thing, it is so. After reading her poems, my soul feels serenity like never before. My heart is not lonely... I can’t tell you how much I love it in a thousand words. It crazily wants to read more poems. I love poems so much because of it. I even like some of my own poems. From then on, I feel that my life can be so poetic, and my life will be enhanced by it. . grateful to have you. 
1	The notebook is shipped fast and the overall settings are reasonable. The first time I bought the Samsung brand, it was better than expected. 
0	This book shouldn’t be called by this name. It doesn’t always agree with the content of the book. It will make a lot of people pay for it and tarnish the author’s reputation. 
1	I bought this book in the mood to give it a try. It is indeed worth the money. Low prices, beautiful pictures, and simple puzzles are all reasons I want to recommend to everyone. The son likes this riddle book very much. I was afraid that the child was young and could not understand or guess the riddles, but he finished all the riddles in 3 nights and clamored for me to buy new ones. I lent this book to my friend, and he also has a boy about the same age as my son, and he likes it very much. It seems that children like this easy-to-learn riddle book. 
0	Very general, it would be even better if you can exemplify words in simple sentences, especially those emotional words! 
1	DELL classic, very cost-effective. I bought two for my colleague last year. This time I bought one for my father. I am very satisfied. 
0	I don't like this shell~ Fingerprints are easy to leave! In addition, there is a small red bright spot after booting. I can’t see it when I turn it off, I don’t know if I can change it. 
0	Online booking of a double room, Ctrip's introduction is too simple, due to the arrival after 18:00, the credit card guarantee, the result is that the arrival is a loft room, it is almost...Hey, I only hope that Ctrip can take the responsibility of reviewing recommended hotels in the future , Otherwise Ctrip members will not... 
0	A lot heavier than the ideapad s10 I bought last time. It’s a bit thick, but it’s all for the battery, so you can’t have it both. 
0	These are the worst in the novels that I have read so far, the worst in romance novels, and the bottom two books in court stories. It's a waste of money~~~ alas~~~~ 
1	The configuration is good. I'm afraid that the display is not good. The detection is not bad. The shell is general. It's OK at this price. 
1	The hotel is nice, the service staff are very nice and polite. It is clean, quiet and convenient. The disadvantage is that check-out is crazy slow, it took me half an hour... 
1	The small book is relatively reasonable, catching up with the special price, I feel comfortable! ! JD shopping is quite enjoyable! 
1	It is very small and beautiful. The system has been installed, tested, and run for a day. The battery performance is really good! Take it out, some weight, ready to search for a suitable backpack to hold it. 
0	Very disappointed, it is better to buy a collection of Zhang Ailing's essays, named after <Lust Ring>, but this article is only more than 10 pages, and has no head and tail, which is completely inferior to any other article in it. 
0	The configuration is general, maybe the small book is basically like this, it is very portable to take it out. Sima gift bag, mouse, inner liner are not sent 
1	Read it all in one breath, haha, if you don’t have time to read it, how can you finish it? I like Zhang Ailing, so I read it. I read a lot of things I didn't know, but I like the ones I liked before. Exquisite and not kitsch, arrogant but really pitiful, not a legend, what is it? I have some insights about communicating with children, for fear that it will be illegal, and I regret it later. Friend-like communication, equality, and careful listening are too harsh and will make the child feel unconfident. This university asks, I am always alert, hoping to make progress. 
1	Compared with the many food books on the market, this book is called food culture. Not only write about food, but also include the author's understanding and perception of food culture. Although it has been published for many years, Sichuan cuisine can indeed be seen in cities of all sizes, and Sichuan restaurants have indeed become a place frequented by many people. Many people who can’t eat spicy food are gradually being influenced by Sichuan cuisine and slowly learning to eat. But it is a pity that there are many Sichuan restaurants, most of which are spicy and spicy dishes, lacking the vegetarian soup that the author mentioned that Sichuanese usually eat. 
0	The low screen resolution is inconvenient for graphics operations. The overall plastic feel is too strong (or directly plastic). It is not very convenient to turn on the non-wearable notebook. There are only 2 hard disk partitions 
1	It is a genuine and licensed product. I spent 8 yuan to choose Yuantong Express. The efficiency is very high. It only took a day from placing an order to receiving the goods. It feels very good. I heard that the system is difficult to install, so I spent 50 oceans looking for someone to install it. It feels very good to use now, the speed is fast, and the screen is perfect, and the invoices, warranty cards and so on are randomly received. I feel that the JD service is very good, and I immediately want to buy a wireless router and a camera, and the friend has a coupon to send it. I have one. Support JD.com. 
0	The attached XP driver disk does not have the correct wireless network card driver, and there is no software such as shortcut keys. You need to go to the website to download it yourself. 
0	It seems that this type is not in my taste, it is a bit complicated, it may be like life, but I like the simpler. You have to draw so much to make a dish, and I thought it was a recipe 
0	What kind of messy things are installed in Lenovo's system, and the 60-day anti-virus trial version is also not installed, it is tiring! In addition, the power adapter is very hot and I am worried. 
1	High cost performance and excellent workmanship. The memory is a single 2G, and there is an empty slot, which is easy to upgrade the memory, praise. The resolution and clarity are also great. The inductive multimedia buttons on the right side of the keyboard are dazzling. 
0	Lived at the end of December 2007. The place is on a small road, and the driver may not find it. The room smelled very musty, the room was dirty and there was no hot water. They told me the next day that the house had just been taken back from the owner and was not ready and should not be rented to me. Why didn't you say it earlier? (Oh, the guest rooms, the owner, and the writing are all mixed up here. On the first floor, you have to ask about the property instead of the front desk of the hotel. They give you a look, dizzy!) I want to check out, there is a man named Li The female manager dragged me to live, and if not, she gave me a free upgrade. Your attitude is good now, but you are still very poor overall. The restaurant on the roof is absolutely bad for breakfast. I don’t know about dinner. The place looks strange and not popular. In short, don't live here, if there is no improvement! 
0	The heat sink is small and the buttons are harder! There is a better solution in D250! The power cord is too big, can you learn from Samsung! I have not considered this, but can the power cord be replaced with a two-core one? ! 
1	"""Puppy Money Money"" was recommended by a good friend of mine and given it to me, and he said that he would put it by the pillow and read it at any time. I read it all at once with this idea and felt that the translator’s language translation was very accurate. There are so many translation traces, (I usually don’t like to read translated books), and the language image is vivid, the story is easy to understand, it is immersive, and there are many reference points. If you can carefully follow this try and do it, (emphasis Understand the spirit), there will be good results. Planning to read it a second time. recommend "
0	I didn’t buy the book, and asked me to write a review. It’s true. Maybe it’s too popular. The sales are so good. I didn’t write out of stock. The book was not sent to me. 
1	The facilities are not new, but very cozy, the location is very good, and the hygiene is good 
1	The room is clean and tidy, and the location is good, but the lack of an elevator is a bit regrettable 
1	Fashionable and beautiful, the price is good, we can't ask for this price too high, I am in the baking machine test. . . . . . . . . Download the operating system address: http://bbs.gatewayfans.com/forum-79-1.html The general installation disk does not work, use this forum system. 
0	It is very simple, it is more suitable for babies under 1 year old, and the paper is not thick. It is recommended that this simple one can be made smaller for easy access. 
0	There are 7 missing pages in the book. To be precise, it is 7 pages of white paper. You save ink, but I suffer from it. It seems that there is no continuity. Sometimes it is incomprehensible and the storyline cannot be connected. Annoying. 
0	Outdated hotel facilities, poor drainage of bathtubs, no room available, one at 16:00, one at 22:00, poor breakfast 
1	It is a small book shared by my daughter and I. The content is a condensed version of the original, but it is complete and interesting. My daughter is still young. If she just reads the text, she still doesn't understand the meaning, and it is easy to make a difference. Therefore, the advantage of this book is that there are a large number of illustrations, which can be used to tell the baby. The effect is good. It only costs more than 1 yuan to enjoy the wonderful stories and parent-child moments. Is it good value for money? My daughter and I are loyal book fans, and I bought all the other books in this set, and I had a good time to read carefully. 
0	This set of books was also decided to buy because it was at the top of the list. After I bought it, I was very excited. I thought I could indulge in the world of books with my daughter for a long time. I didn't expect that a book with a boring story, I was almost bored! Personally, the author seems to misplace the story just for the drawing. The picture is very meticulous, so I don’t have to say. 
0	Because reading the book reviews is very tempting~ I think I am in my early twenties and I should learn how to manage my future... But I was disappointed when I bought it. The content is very empty ~ the writing is too superficial. There are some advices for girls, the examples given are nothing novel, nor deep enough. The quality of the book is not good. Like cheap romance novels, there are people around who want to buy them, so they just give them to her. 
1	The screen is good, only one dead pixel was found. The system installed with the XP disk of the new carrot home. It works well. The screen is big enough and the keyboard is fine. Equipped with a 2G memory plus the original 3G. The speed is okay. No feeling of card. 
0	After reading it for one third, I couldn't stand it anymore. I bought a set. It's not worth it. One piece of advice for everyone: buy a copy first and check it out, and then buy the rest. 
0	After using the QQ10 yuan gift voucher, I was so curious to see if the gift voucher could be used after the order was cancelled, and even said that it can't be used! 10 yuan for hard-earned! ! ! ! It was so ruined! If you don't return my money, you will have nowhere to go! ! ! ! ! ! He even said that he would not go to work on Saturdays and Sundays! Return my 10 yuan gift voucher, and I will buy something, if I don’t return it, I’ll be with you! This group of pig brains did not give much consideration to customers when the system was set up! 
1	First of all, the service is very good. The service level in the south is generally higher than that in the north. It makes people feel at home. There was a girl at the elevator asking about the floor to go to. She thought it was the elevator to welcome the guests, and then recommended to the entertainment floor. Good impression. The hardware is very ordinary, just like Samsung. Breakfast is average, and Ctrip's 30 yuan is not particularly cheap. 
0	The heat generation is not resolved, and the heat dissipation effect is not ideal. Basically the CPU must be kept above 50 degrees. Secondly, in the promotion message, it is clearly stated that it supports bright color technology, but after the system is installed, splendid is not available at all, and the shortcut key fn+c cannot be used. The memory performance is slightly worse. 
0	Black shop, black shop, absolutely black shop. Black shop, black shop, absolutely black shop. Black shop, black shop, absolutely black shop. 
1	China Coal Building is in a hotel of the same price, and I personally feel that the price/performance ratio is acceptable. It's just that the room I live in faces the street, which is noisy at night. 
1	The transportation is very convenient, the room is a bit small, but clean and tidy, very Hong Kong characteristics, high cost performance, I recommend it 
1	The first is the masterpiece, and the second is the famous writer, plus the famous publishing house, it won't make you feel tempted. I personally like Jin Shengtan's version of The Water Margin, because the text is refined and there are not many verbose things, even though Mr. Lu Xun is very dissatisfied with the talent of Jin Dazhi who cut the Water Margin. But I think this is a person who is serious about studying, at least he has his own words. To paraphrase Mr. Lu’s words, only comparison can be distinguished. It is recommended that friends who like the Water Margin read this after 120 back to the local Water Margin. 70 times in gold. 
0	Since the water in the room is rusty water, the assistant manager in the lobby is upgraded to a suite for free. As I booked for 3 days, it was 478 for the first 2 nights and 578 for the third night. As a result, the direct telling was only 678 on the third day, and it was ineffective after reporting with Ctrip. The reason was that a group of people came here for a meeting on the third day and there were not enough rooms, and the guests were deliberately driven away. Resolutely never live here again. The attitude is very bad. 
0	The C drive is also too big. It took a lot of effort to find a software that can be partitioned under VISTA. The shell is a little too thin, giving people a sense of lack of confidence. 
0	It’s too common sense. People with a little English foundation will not make these mistakes 
1	At first, the bios did not set the F12 key and could not boot from the CD-ROM drive. Later, the partition table was broken and the partition could not be formatted. It took a long time to try to repair the partition table in the DOS toolbox, and then the partition was installed. Thank you, the notebook is fine, no problem. 
0	"After reading it, I think it's very general. But it has not yet reached the level that requires so many people to criticize Yu Dan. Philosophy is the knowledge of ""the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom"". Everyone has their own opinions, so it is normal to criticize. Yu Dan became famous too quickly, and the Chinese have a bad habit of ""to irritate others, but not to laugh at others"", so criticism is normal. Intellectuals in ancient times emphasized ""safe and happy, not be surprised, indifferent to fame, quiet and far-reaching."" They can use the doctrine of sages to preach. Selling books and seeking profit may not be in line with the values of being a scholar, so criticism is normal. However, I can understand. "
1	"This book has almost been ripped through by me. There are too few people like China and such books. I didn't expect this book to pass the review. Now the so-called experts, scholars, and officials are conscientious and knowledgeable. They either don't dare to say anything, or they are talking nonsense, flattering and ""contemplating one's favor"", which is disgusting. Fortunately, this book is valued by today’s leaders. According to the teacher’s blog, the Politburo Standing Committee members have one copy, and the leaders of various central ministries and commissions are also reading it. Some provinces and cities are also required reading for learning the scientific development concept. "
0	"The test software shows that the cpu diode heats up, and it hovered around 62 degrees soon after it was turned on. There is no spring cover when closing; it cannot be opened with one hand, probably because the ""bottom plate"" is too light, ha. The chip crystal board can be seen through a row of heat dissipation holes at the bottom, uh, it feels a bit imprecise. The screen color is too strong "
1	"After reading this book, I felt that it was very well written. It was not very rational, it was very simple and dialectically looked at the work of the class teacher, including the situation of ""corporal punishment"" of students. The book has its own unique opinions. It is a book that I have seen that is different from the work of many class teachers, or is it an alternative. It is a book that originates from reality and originates from the grassroots. Basically, the confusion and contradictions of the class teacher can be answered. If you are interested, please take a look. Maybe your head teacher will be extremely easy and free of thought. "
0	To tell the truth, the writing is not very good, it’s a piece of cake, the protagonist’s psychological quality is still a psychologist, it’s really amazing. 
0	If you go to Zhouzhuang to travel and experience the amorous feelings of the water town, it is better to go to the private hotel in the scenic area. The environment is not better than the private hotel, and the service is not good! Originally, there were few shuttle buses to the city. It took an hour and a half. I rushed to Pudong Airport that day. He simply said that the shuttle bus had been cancelled, making me wait for 2 hours and 50 minutes. . . . . . . 
0	I have not received the order after 4 days. I don’t know if Dangdang’s delivery is all this efficiency? After the complaint was over, the customer service replied that it was a normal phenomenon, and the order processing time had the final say! 
0	The system cannot be accessed normally, and the hard disk has abnormal sounds. It should be normal for products to encounter quality problems, but Jingdong’s service attitude is really unsatisfactory: it is extremely irresponsible for the processing of replacement applications and various production difficulties. Strongly request Jingdong exchange! 
1	Teacher Zhou’s book is definitely worth reading. Originally, I didn’t like reading essays. However, I opened Teacher Zhou’s book to see what she had read. Through her feelings while reading, I understood and touched. Isn't it interesting to enter a serious and profound world? Teacher Zhou said that this is a book that defines real scholars, and it will isolate those pseudo-students with a flamboyant, superficial, and utilitarian mentality. She humbly said that she did not write well, but the books she introduced were all intriguing classics. So, read this book and lock yourself away from the book. 
0	What book? I don’t like it. I don’t understand why I have to die. If the death of the son is understandable, the death of the daughter is far-fetched. In the end, the death of the son-in-law and grandson is simply incredible. All the relatives left one by one. Does it make sense to live like this? 
0	One of the scariest hotels I've ever stayed in in my life, comparable to hotels outside Jakarta, Indonesia (laughs)! 1. The room smelled of musty, smoke, no windows to ventilate, and the stains on the dirty carpets were shocking. 2. The toilets are dirty, stains and odors accumulated over the years make it impossible to go to the toilet. 3. The corridor is dim and dim. Please be sure to travel with a few people when you return to your room at night. 4. It has the advantage, but the attitude of the waiter is good. In short, I posted 1000 yuan and refused to stay again. 
0	The score for the machine subsystem is only 3.5, mainly because the graphics processing functions are lower, and others are okay. Also, a mouse touchpad switch function should be used! 
0	Do you want your child to be a humorous person? Do you want your child to be an imaginative person? Do you want to make your children happy and laugh? Carmela is a good choice. Carmela's peculiar thoughts give life a small episode, just like gentle ripples on the calm lake. After getting Carmela, the first thing I enjoyed was myself, and the second was my husband. Then was my two-year-old baby girl. Although she still can't understand the whole storyline, many scenes inside make her very happy. For example, Carmelas pose for fishing in various poses. Egg laying scene. The daughter who has a strong imitative ability also poses various poses, filling the whole family with joy. I think everyone will like Carmela and needs Carmela in life. 
1	The performance is good, the price is moderate, and I bought a wireless AP on JD. It feels good, and I don’t get stuck in watching movies wirelessly. Much better than a wireless router. 
1	The shell of the piano paint has a watery texture and it feels good. The configuration of this notebook is also good, and it is a reasonable match! Value for money! 
1	The location of this hotel, the room price is good. But I wonder if it is due to the large number of guests, the service has naturally declined. Ctrip's guests seem to be not very popular here. Every time you stay, if you do not have a double room or not The room is not, if it hadn’t been cleaned, and the membership card points could not be accumulated. The front desk said it was stipulated above, and there is no basis. Additional comment December 9, 2007: The service of this hotel is getting worse and worse, the hotel The facilities are also old, not as good as before. I will not live anymore. 
1	Nice hotel! The rooms are large and comfortable! Because it is on the 21st floor, it is very quiet! The restaurant on the first floor is cheap and good but there are few varieties! It is a very good hotel in Tongxiang! 
0	The location of the hotel is OK and the price is barely enough. The rooms are relatively old and the sanitary conditions are not very satisfactory. In short, it is not like a three-star hotel 
0	I bought this book because I read a lot of good reviews. Although I don’t have much money, I’ve never been a person who spends money in a random manner, especially if I am interested in a lot of flowers. This book is a special case. . I really don’t understand why so many people give good reviews. It seems that everyone’s requirements for books are too low these days, and you can write books as individuals! Forcing myself to read most of the contents of this book, I still didn’t get any substantive things. Now it’s a time-consuming society. Even if I wasted my money, I can’t waste my precious life anymore! It's not big anymore. This book is like a chicken rib. A dear guy said it is good, hype, yes, it is hype, and it is very exciting. The above is purely personal humble opinion, for reference only! 
0	I ordered it for a friend, and the response is not very good. It must be related to the size of the city. The four-star in Yichang is definitely not comparable to the four-star in the big city. Specifically, let’s talk about the occupancy situation: 1. The rooms are said to be relatively old, the facilities seem to be relatively old, and the cleanliness needs to be investigated 2. It is said that so so 3. There are few English-speaking waiters, and English-speaking waiters speak very little English . No matter how four-star stars are, how to improve the level of receiving foreign guests, not to mention that there are still many foreign tourists in the Three Gorges. 
0	The room is too small. When I got the room at the front desk, I said that I didn't have a reservation, and I had to call Ctrip to confirm! 
1	Everything is okay, but why can’t I be more flexible about the rooms booked through the Internet? Half-day rooms are reasonable, especially for chain hotels. 
0	The end face of the adapter is curved, which looks beautiful, but why not the power plug is also designed as a curved surface, and the flat surface is connected to the curved surface. The mechanical designer's fault is that the power will be cut off with a touch. 
0	The system is indeed difficult to install, and the idea is quite simple: I installed it with a USB flash drive. I first used winPE to make the USB flash drive into a boot disk, and then copied the things in the system CD to the USB flash drive to start the machine BIOS The item is adjusted to USB-HDD to start, after entering the winPE interface, 
1	Cheap and cheapest. Personally think 160G is better than 250G and safe. Quiet, hehe, pretty good, although it is uglier and original in appearance than those more than 5000 books. But I don’t take it for viewing. 
1	"The first series was borrowed from a friend. Not only children like it, but I also love it. It's not Chongyang. The book's perspective is indeed different from that of domestic children's books. It does not blindly preach, but rather a vivid story. Let children feel the joy of reading, I think this is the most important thing in reading. So when ""I want to find Lang Lang"" came out, I bought it without hesitation. When the second edition came out, I didn't hesitate to buy it. I also introduced many friends to buy it. Unfortunately, the second series contains the book ""I want to find Lang Lang"". "
1	The hotel is relatively new, with complete facilities and convenient transportation. Still a bit expensive. Additional comments on December 25, 2007: Fortunately, there is a company to pay the bill, and I feel that the room is big enough and the transportation is convenient. 
1	I didn't understand the installation system at first! After knowing it a little trouble! It feels very simple! ! ! Not bad! ! ! 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
0	The hotel is not like a five-star hotel, most of which is three-star standard. It is disappointing. The sea view of the two rooms can only see one corner, and there is no sense of service. We have forgotten things in both rooms. As a result, we arrived in Penglai and no one contacted we. I called and asked them to send it back, but they were all playing football. Depressed~~ 
1	The location is good. It takes about 7.5 yuan from the bus terminal to the hotel by TAXI. The rooms are even better, clean, tidy and comfortable, at a price of 355 per night, which is very cost-effective. But breakfast is a bit expensive! I will stay in Quanzhou next time. 
1	This is very well written. It put aside the well-known things and picked up the lesser-known memory fragments, such as the letter written by the blank scroll hero Zhang Tiesheng to the marking team, such as the letter written by an ordinary rural teacher to Mao Zedong, each fragment has a profound meaning behind it. In the historical background of China, a seemingly trivial remark or action brought unexpected shocks to China at that time. The author's rich language deeply reflects rational observation and thinking. Those vigorous events are worthy of our memory, and these minor details obliterated by history are worthy of our reflection. 
0	There are two shortcomings: 1. The power box is extremely hot! It's very hot soon after the power is connected! 2. There is only one memory slot, and the original one must be removed to add memory. 
0	The wireless network card is hard to drive, the air outlet on the left is not good, and it is easy to burn hands. It is suitable in winter, and the design is at the back. 
0	The bad can't be bad. A 3 cm cockroach was found next to the toilet trash can. The bed sheet was covered with blood stains. I called to change it. The waiter came and said that it was just changed. The blood stains cannot be washed off. 
0	Check-in night, because the train arrived late. When I went to the front door of the hotel, it felt like an unfinished building, with black lights and blazing lights. I thought the taxi had been pulled in the wrong place. When I went to the main station later, I asked about the decoration of the lobby. When I went to the room, the settings in the room became worse. There are patches everywhere on the carpet, a musty smell, and I live in a luxurious standard double. I don't know what the general standard will be? More than 200 RMB is not as good as today's budget hotels, so disappointed, the products are out of order (compared with the picture). Hotel Feedback May 30, 2008: Thank you for your valuable comments! I'm really sorry, on behalf of the hotel, I would like to express my sincere apologies to you! The hotel has all resolved the issues you raised, and you are welcome to stay next time! 
1	The deluxe room I stayed in had too thick quilts and super hot sleep at night. The lady at the front desk had an average attitude and didn't see a smiling face. The hotel service is better. 
0	"I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad. Dandong also stayed on the 20th floor of the International Hotel. This time I chose this so-called only four-star hotel in Dandong because of business, but I have never seen a hotel with such poor service quality. Enemies with guests everywhere. I checked in on the 14th. Since I was on a flight at 11pm on the 16th, at noon on the 15th, I asked the front desk if I could charge a total of two and a half days for the room at 6pm on the 16th. The front desk agreed at the time and swiped my two and a half days of advance payment. But wait until 6:2 pm on the 16th, comrades, after two minutes, they actually want to charge me for three days' room. At that time, I was patient and explained to the two waiters at the front desk. Later, a female assistant manager with glasses also came over. It can be said that the hotel computer system will automatically lock for one day after six o'clock. The deputy manager later called to ask Manager Chen for instructions. I stood by and heard the details with my own ears. She just said that a guest wanted to check out after six o'clock and asked for a long time, okay? After getting the negative answer, she raised her head and rejected herself. I told her: ""You call for instructions? You talked to your manager on the phone and told me the fact that you agreed on the 15th?"" She was asked to stop! Because I was in a hurry, I didn't bother to argue with them. I advise Ctrip not to sign another housing contract with this hotel, lest it attract more complaints. "
0	The room is too small. The facilities are too rubbish. The bath water is cold for half a day. It takes a long time to have hot water. The bath room is filled with water for 5 minutes, so I originally settled for 10 days, but after 2 days, it was retired The refrigerator is not connected, and the broadband is ok. 
1	HP international brand, 4411S notebook keyboard breaks the previous style. The exterior design is very fashionable. Has the personality of IBM Xiaohei The battery is good. It can be used for 2-3 hours under normal conditions 
1	"The war has brought endless pain to people. No matter what those who chase rights get, the wounded will always be the unarmed people. There is a sentence that makes me particularly sad, ""Afghanistan has many children but no childhood."" Innocent children come to this world and experience painful destiny. Maybe they really want to ""always in hot water"" and they are very tired. Very tired. I am also moved by Hassan’s loyalty, ""for you, thousands of times"". In this modern age full of lies, interests, and living in a mask, there are a few loyal friends who are willing to pay for you like this. . "
1	Seeing some people commenting on this book is horrible, I feel that the words are serious. In fact, this is just a way to train people to think positively. Can someone comment on being unfairly treated in the company without complaining? Just imagine, if your thinking is positive enough and you are positive enough to think right, your thinking will have a certain influence on others. Everyone needs others to treat themselves with the correct attitude, including your boss, boss, They are also human. 
1	The cup is powerful, the workmanship is good, and the technology of the thinkpad R series is really good! Integrated graphics, ran 3dmark06, scored 792 points, no problem watching HD, no problem with World of Warcraft, Need for Speed has not tested yet, it is said that the effect of 800*600 is very smooth for all meetings! 
0	I didn’t receive this book with Ben. What is going on on your website? I bought the book and haven't received it yet. I was really disappointed that the book did not receive any comments from me. I don’t want to say too much, just a word, I bought this book from you, and I haven’t received the book yet. 
0	1. The workmanship of this machine is relatively rough, and the plastic feel is too heavy. This should be for the sake of lightness and sacrifices the quality of the material. 2. The workmanship of the position where the battery is inserted at the bottom of the machine is really poor. This HP needs to be reviewed 3. It is still a manufacturing design problem, and the design of the power socket location is unreasonable 
1	The standard big bed room with jacuzzi and sauna is very unique. 400 holidays, free broadband, and single breakfast are also worthwhile. Will stay next time I go to feel the free jacuzzi and sauna again:) 
1	The location is very good, very close to the bar street in Houhai, it is very convenient to go clubbing at night. But the hotel facilities are relatively old, and the hair dryer in the bathroom of the room is actually broken. The business computer room I live in. The so-called business computer room has a monitor and a keyboard. If you want to go online, you still need to bring your own computer and connect to it... I don’t understand this a bit... Could someone just bring a computer? The host goes out? But considering the price/performance ratio, it's not bad. I mainly like this location. 
0	The house price was more than 400, but I was very disappointed, old and dirty, worse than Jinjiang Inn. I will definitely not go again. How can such hardware facilities and services attract customers? 
1	The writing is very large, so I bought one and kept it at home for the child to check, and the other small one for him to take to school. Starting from the second semester of the first grade, the teacher asked the unrecognized words to be checked by himself. The problem is that there are too many new words in the homework, and the children's eyes can't stand the tossing. The child is now in the second grade. Many of the children have had visual loss in the last examination class, and some have already put on glasses, so hurry up and buy this large-format dictionary. Attention, parents, because the page numbers of the large and small editions are different, so you should buy a small edition and put it in your school bag. Teachers in schools sometimes have dictionary competitions or something, and the page numbers are different and troublesome. 
0	"The waiter in the restaurant was not friendly, and some of the free breakfasts were not served at 8 in the morning (steamed eggs and fried rice noodles). The little girl negotiated with the waiter twice and the breakfast was served until 9 in the morning. Hope The hotel should improve the breakfast supply. The room attendants should be trained. When the guest’s door lock is hung with the words ""Do Not Disturb"", they hope that they will not enter the guest room without authorization. This is a respect for the guests. "
0	Plug in the power and boot. I found a scratch next to the power button, contacted Jingdong, and was told that the appearance defect could not be replaced. The customer service even said that the abrasive tool may be designed like that. Regular scratches that are too obvious, about 0.6cm long. For other purchases, remember to unpack and check the appearance under the witness of delivery. 
1	"The author of ""Special Gua Sha Skills"" is Teacher Zhou Xinwen, who is my tuina teacher. I thank you after Tuina and benefited a lot. I solve my problems by myself, and I help solve the problems of my relatives and friends. "
0	The service at the front desk was very poor. On October 1st, Manager Xu, the on-duty manager, deliberately deceived me from a standard room of 220 yuan a night into a business room for 380 yuan. Fortunately, Ctrip's customer service called me to confirm that I was not fooled. 
0	Nothing else, but the house price is cheap. Very old star hotel, ashamed of the 4 star standard. Additional comments May 31, 2008: But this one is better in Anqing, others are either far away or worse. 
1	The facilities are good, the location is good, but the level of service staff is almost the same. Check out in the morning is too slow, waiting for forty minutes. A Beijing guy and a group of Shanghai people scolded at the front desk because of the check-out line, and the service staff did not dare to come forward to mediate. Next time I live at Intercontinental or Hilton. 
0	The book has no content, and the title has all been summarized. I really admire the author's ability to write one thing into a book, and then I read the book about only one thing. I really admire myself as well. 
1	I discovered this book by chance. I feel that the process of reading this book is the process of purifying my own thoughts. This book starts with the trivial matters of getting along with the children in the family. The author carefully feels the children’s behavior and changes in words and deeds. The good and the bad, the good and the timely affirmation and appropriate praise (but), the bad starts with the parents. Find the problem by yourself (there is a problem in education), can tolerate the shortcomings of the child, and the method of solving the problem is reasonable and easy for the child to accept. Be able to become close friends with your parents! After reading, I feel that I have benefited a lot! 
1	When I was young, I saw this book for the first time in a classmate's house, but the black and white characters brought me a lot of happiness. What is conceived in ordinary life is so vivid in the hands of the artist. With a touch of familiarity and touch, I will still remember the father and son as an adult. Since Dangdang this book, my colleagues felt naive at first, but soon, people who read this book will be attracted by the interesting pictures and will be moved gradually. I recommend this book, whether it is adults or children, you can read it, not bad~! The binding is exquisite and the graphics are also very good. The price is even more favorable. Recommend~! 
0	The SONY recovery software is simply made by an idiot. The system area must be greater than 120G, and third-party software can be used to distinguish redundant systems. The system area is less than 120G, and the system recovery software cannot be used (the default is less than 120G for illegal operations). Very rough, almost like a copycat version 
1	I have read some books about women's speech and affairs before, but they often disappoint me. The content is a long story, without learning practical things, wasting time and money. This book uses 108 details, little by little, very targeted, as the so-called details determine success or failure. The language is refined, the content is practical and philosophical, it is worth reading. 
1	Small and light, it is lighter than my X61, and the workmanship is consistently good. The screen is brighter than the X61 and the resolution is also higher. 
1	The building is beautiful. The price is not cheap. Other general. So Sofitel sounds great. 
1	I like this hotel because there is a smile there! Because it is convenient! Because the price is reasonable! And Tsingtao Beer at 56 Dengzhou Road! When I went to Wuhu, I was often unable to order Guoxin because of rush. What a pity! 
0	The only fly in the ointment is the memory??? A failure! Then there is that if you can integrate Bluetooth and fingerprint recognition in one, it will be beautiful! (Imagine, haha~~) 
1	It is purely a story of a Northeastern. From the very beginning, she laughed to death. Yue Sheng's abnormal family background grew up a strange and irritable girl. As a result, she met Liu Ling who had the same temper. She was really a pair of children. , The dialogue is rough, but it's very crunchy. Although I have stayed in the Northeast for 20 years, I have never been in contact with that kind of people. Besides, I have been away for so long, so I feel very funny and very friendly. That is a straightforward world. First, the classmates said it was good, and then I read half of it online. I haven't read a book that is purely Northeastern, so I just bought it and read it slowly. 
0	The screen is a bit too long, it is uncomfortable to see at first, and the keyboard spacing is too large. The pre-installed LINUX system will not work, and it took a long time to modify QP. 
0	The hotel environment is not bad and the decoration is also very good. The breakfast is not good and the price is high. 
0	The view of the room is pretty good, and it looks out like an ancient canal, which is full of ancient poetry. But the shower facilities in the room were not good, the shower door was not closed tightly, the water from the faucet was very small, and the bath was very uncomfortable. The TV has two remote controls, which is very inconvenient to use. The main front desk lady's service is very bad, cold, especially the fat-faced lady, whose face is like paste, without a smile. When I went to CHECK IN and CHECK OUT, I felt very uncomfortable. I feel that the training of waiters needs to be strengthened and the sense of service is too poor! ! ! 
1	The delivery was fast and arrived the next day. The appearance is also good, the problem of enough home installation system has not been encountered, and XP is installed smoothly. 
0	1. I live in a standard room by the road. The facilities in the room are simple, and there is a layer of curtain wall glass outside the glass windows of the room, and it cannot be opened, resulting in the room cannot be naturally ventilated and the lighting is not good. 2. Eat three breakfasts, the variety is pitiful. 3. The restaurant on the second floor is rented out, and the price is very expensive. It turns out that when ordering meals, I told the guests that they can get a 10% discount (it is clearly stated in the room service guide, but when the checkout is made, it is told that seafood and beverages cannot be discounted, and there is no invoice. It is difficult to find the manager the next day Get the invoice. In general, the gap with the four-star is too big! 
1	"I bought this book ""Crossing the Taj Mahal"" because I like the Taj Mahal very much. When I was in elementary school, I liked the pictures of the Taj Mahal in an art book for the first time. It was a love at first sight. Although I don't know under what background it was built, but I simply like it and hope that one day I can go to Agra to witness its elegance. This book is not as good as I expected, but it is still good. Because from the book I learned what I didn't know before, and I can increase my knowledge. I've long wanted to read the passage about the Taj Mahal, and now this wish has come true, which is great. "
0	The service attitude of the hotel staff is not very polite, the room staying in is relatively simple, and the price of the room is expensive. 
1	Incorporating a new high-strength engineering plastic + piano paint shell design, it really brings a new and full sense of fashion to users visually; T6570 dual-core processor, the latest 45 nanometer technology, independent graphics card; equipped with a high-definition camera above it , It is convenient for users to conduct business meetings better; LED backlight screen, more environmentally friendly and energy-saving 
0	The speaker effect is not very good, there is noise. It can only be used for general use, and a speaker is required. The display effect is also average. In addition, the anti-virus software that comes with it can't be registered at all, it was deleted by me, and it is now running naked. And that card reader, I tried it once, but it didn't work. I don't know what the problem is. 
0	No package, no bluetooth, no system, sata hard drive, but a lot of effort to install the system, and finally spent 30 to install the system in the computer city, and I can’t use ghost to backup! ! ! ! ! ! ! fall down 
1	Small, beautiful, full-featured, easy to carry, and strong battery life (although it does not reach the official 9.5 hours) 
1	The advantages of this hotel: cheap, beautiful sea view, convenient to Ocean Park, there is an air-conditioned bus to the park entrance not far downstairs, and the card is only 6 yuan, which is a few yuan cheaper than the bus from Admiralty to Ocean Park. The hotel staff is very nice (the porter sent the luggage to the room and forgot to pay for it. After he left politely, we only remembered that Hong Kong has a habit of paying for consumption o(∩_∩)o... Going downstairs to find a place to eat, I ran into the doorman again, and he was very polite and polite and patiently explained how to go, and what places to eat nearby. Also, we heard that we should stay for 10 when we go out every day RMB as a tip for the cleaning aunt. But when we come back, the 10 RMB is still on the table) Disadvantages: a bit old (the room is small, so we don’t care about it o(∩_∩)o... The decoration facilities and style are quite different from Disney hotels, but the room price is also half the price o(∩_∩)o... It is not very convenient to travel, although there are buses to various places. , But the bus in Hong Kong does not report the stop. We were dizzy in the car and didn't know where we were. The next day I had to take a taxi to the subway station (but the starting price can get to the subway station). In Hong Kong, only taking the subway is the most secure and knowing where you are. After several stops on the bus, you can remember it, oh! It should have just arrived~ Khan~ So next time I go to Hong Kong, I might choose to stay in a hotel next to the subway. 
0	There is no operating system CD, no driver CD; I got a blue screen when I started installing my own Mcphee 8, and the system crashed immediately. After installing XP, I was mad: many drivers could not be found, especially no sound when I got it. Finally got XP to install at the repair station, depressed! Later I learned that there is a key to restore~ 
1	I didn’t expect much from this book, because I have always liked Yu Jie and I didn’t agree with Zhu Yong’s previous views. However, after reading this book, I have a better understanding of Zhu Yong’s thoughts. Some of Zhu Yong's views, in general, Zhu Yong's analysis of others is rational (a bit over criticism of Yu Jie), and his explanation of the problem is relatively objective. But there is also a feeling of literati disparagement, as the friend upstairs said, he is too dear to himself. Summary: It is recommended to read. 
1	The hotel is a bit old but the rooms are clean, and the rooms on the upper floors are quiet. If you go to Datong next time, you will live again. 
1	Maybe there is a little kindness in human nature, praying for others or having peace and happy wars seem to be far away from us, but in fact it is very close, just a few latitudes or a few years, think about it, it is really very close. Laila in the story really appreciates and admires her very much. If she is a symbol of the new generation of women in Afghanistan, how can she not be respected. Looking at the misery of others, I think of my own happiness. This is really cruel, but I am a cowardly person. Perhaps all I can do is to be grateful and grateful for everything. Appreciate all the ordinary and appreciate peace! 
1	"It would be great if you could read this book during pregnancy! Of course it is not too late, as long as young parents who can read this book are not too late for educating their children well. This book not only talks about how to educate children to learn, but more importantly, teach children how to behave and do things! How to play well, and who to play well with, all made good examples. Children who are well-rounded are better! The fly in the ointment is that I again began to doubt whether this book is genuine? If it is genuine, then the publisher's proofreading team is a bit too bad, not only typos often appear, even the ranking can be wrong! It's really shameful to say ""(Collector's Edition)""! ! "
0	The heat is relatively large, and the fan sound is acceptable. These are okay and do not affect the use. What is annoying is the postal logistics service. It is too casual, and the notebook does not call to accept it. It is not allowed to inspect the goods. Going, if there is a problem with the transportation, the responsibility is not on your own? 
1	The room environment is very clean, but the place is not particularly easy to find, ha ha. 
1	In the city center, shopping and eating are very convenient. Service is good, standard room facilities are slightly old. 
0	The typical kitsch and entertaining texts written in a ridiculous tone to cater to the taste of the public are wordy and disgusting. 
1	"Whether it is Mr. Bones or its owner Willie, they are always searching for themselves, for the home of the soul, and for utopia. When Willie was young, he belonged to the Beat generation, drug-addicted, anti-social, self-proclaimed, and ran out of money. When he was poor and sick, he was still searching for his utopia, Timpot. As for Mr. Bones, he also left with Pentinporto in the end. Willy is to Mr. Bones what Willy’s childhood teacher is to Willy. The former points to the latter’s bewildered soul a path that is not clear but is still a direction. Who is not confused, even ""Mr. Bone"" as a dog! "
0	Don't live in a complex building. It was really a Zonghe building. It was on the roadside and outside the gate of the scenic spot. It was no different from a roadside hotel. In addition, I read the reviews and said there are few hot springs, poor service, Believe it or not, the result of the experience is: the waiter said, how many guests will open the pool. As a result, a group of us are in the same pool. Fortunately, the children don't mind, but I do. This is the worst hot spring in Guangdong Province. The only advantage: comprehensive The rooms converted into the building are large in size. 
1	High cost performance, appreciation after buying! After installing for a long time, it must be XP SP3 or above, otherwise the hard disk will not recognize it. 
0	I moved in at the beginning of June. It is said that the back building is in better condition than the front building, so I lived in the back building for 180 nights. The room is very small, the exterior wall is being painted on the back floor, and scaffolding is everywhere. Asked the deposit at the front desk, but the floor attendant wanted to take the deposit slip away. I talked to the front desk, and the front desk had a very tough attitude, saying that this is their rule, which has been the case for more than a decade, and that it will allow me to adapt slowly. I disagree. The front desk asked me to ask the floor attendant to handle it myself. The floor attendant returned the deposit slip to me, but was annoyed and asked us to pay attention. I don't know what to pay attention to. Opening the window at night makes it very noisy to the air-conditioned machine room on the front floor. There are also scaffolding, any thief can climb directly into our room. There is almost no room service, and everything that can be broken in the bathroom is broken. 
0	A bit disappointed! It's not funny at all. The so-called jokes are caused by low-level spelling errors. Although the room discount book, I still feel a little worthless. 
1	Very nice hotel, the rooms are large and the bathroom design is good, but the drinks equipment in the room is insufficient. I brought some good bottles of red wine from California, but there were no glasses, but the hotel delivered them right away. The services of guest rooms and concierge are very good. Among the five-star hotels in Dalian, the price is reasonable (but still more expensive than the five-star hotel I stayed in Beijing). I have stayed in other five-star hotels in Dalian, and this one is more cost-effective. 
1	The size is small, the performance is not bad, I have already got it, hehe, I don't feel so mysterious in the bad reviews, it seems there are really gunmen. To be honest, the price/performance ratio is very high. I am a student and I am currently using her for my graduation project. There is no problem in running OPNET with 1G memory! Haha, cool, praise Jingdong! 
0	Just play the game and don’t know what’s going on. The first test of cs shows that there is a problem, so try again. 
1	Mo Shen's love for Zhimin has been hidden deep in his heart since he was 18 years old, and he was destined for it for a lifetime! I have been very seriously waiting for her to grow up, and can always give the best love to the woman she loves at the right time. Although many times they can't meet each other, they can't even speak, but the corner of my heart is always waiting for each other! And Zhimin’s self-reliance, self-reliance and self-reliance character really make me like it, and their college life also makes me envious. Although they once wandered because of family, the power of love is great. As long as there is love, there is nothing else Overcome it! 
0	The color of this machine is too monotonous. It is just one kind of red, if there are several colors, such as black. White is perfect. And the system is a bit not easy to install 
0	The quality and speed are good, that is, YTO Express is too bad. It is indicated on the bill that it is signed by the person, but the courier can sign it by himself, and there is no sense of responsibility at all! 
0	The front desk service of the hotel is poor and the guests are not warm. Claimed that Ctrip has no reservations. It feels that the guests are begging for them, and we must live. This hotel will not stay next time! 
1	Good location, in the heart of Xujiahui, Shanghai, average price-performance ratio, large room 
0	The breakfast was good, the room was too small, and the online map was unclear and not careful! 
1	The shape is good and exquisite. At first glance, it looks like a netbook, but it is a bit thick. Workmanship is fine. Very cheap 
1	I spent the whole night reading the whole book, and after reading it, I really can’t leave it behind. From the book I feel Chi Li’s strong maternal love for her daughter, but she is very rational, not petting, nor forcing her daughter in the name of love Do what she doesn't like. She gives her daughter 100% trust, respect, and support. These are true love of a mother, and rational. I admire her very much, and her daughter has grown into a caring, confident, Self-esteem, self-love and self-improvement. This is the most important thing. What is success, this is success, success in life. I am very fortunate to have bought this book, and I hope I can be a good mother. 
0	The heat dissipation is not good. This argument is much better than the Thinkpad series. The VISTA installed is too slow, so you can get it. If you change the xp, it will be too slow and unbearable. 
0	It is one of the few books that I regret buying. It is too expensive and the content is not as good as others commented. It depends on whether the child likes it 
1	High cost performance, excellent heat dissipation, less noise when reading disks, but relatively quiet, acceptable 
0	I don’t know if it’s a hard drive or something. It’s been running. It’s not stopping, it’s rhythmic, and you can listen to it as a drum. It’s normal after taking it to ASUS after-sales service! ! Angry~! ! ! I'm so angry~! ! ! It would be a loss in case it gets caught and closed for a year~! ! ! ! 
0	The printing quality of the book is very good, but I personally find it worthless! It feels that the content is not good, and the packaging feels very luxurious! What is sold is not the content but the packaging! 
0	I read the many good reviews on the Internet and decided to buy it. I didn’t expect to be disappointed! I just categorized some commonly used English words. It didn’t help me at all, and no one else said it was funny and funny! When I was in junior high school, my English teacher taught us to classify English words. Very general... 
0	I don't know why this set of books is so popular, but I don't feel good about him. For example, I saw the book mentioning that Carmela was peeing in the sea (if I remember correctly), so I bought three sets and returned two sets. The other set was given out. Ugh! I think it’s better to choose character education for children’s education. For example, my best dad and me. Reading this kind of books can cultivate the relationship between children and fathers. Although the quality and printing of this set of books are good, it seems that these contents cannot help children shape their character. If what I said is wrong, I hope to communicate with me privately. sarah.liuhui@qq.com 
0	The smell of plastic is heavy, the body is thin, and I have had a blue screen after using it! I don't know why, it's under observation. 
1	The configuration is cost-effective. Cameras, microphones, card readers, etc. are all there. The DVD burner is made by Hitachi LG and has good compatibility. The mold is heavier and more reliable than MSI's previous Value series models. There is no VISTA basic system with chicken ribs, which saves costs. 
0	The location of the hotel is very remote, transportation, shopping, and dining are extremely inconvenient 
1	The heat dissipation effect is very good, the machine configuration is good, the price is relatively cheap, the price is good, it is recommended! 
0	The delivery speed is extremely slow. The book ordered on May 5 has not been received until now. I call customer service and say that the delivery is every time. 
0	This book is boring. The whole book for the mentally handicapped. The delivery speed of Dangdang is too slow. I only received it in a month. The service attitude is extremely poor. I sent the email to the past and I never regret it. There seems to be no use for shopping coupons! 
0	It may be a true portrayal of that era, but I can’t bear to see that all the money at home is spent on real estate and all the real estate is lost. Daddy here is so angry that I can’t accept this kind of life. Living should be to make life better, not Make life worse and lose interest 
0	I ordered a total of 6 books this time, and only sent me 5 books, but this one was missing. As for why there weren’t, no one gave me an answer, and I didn’t say a word! 
1	When I got this set of books, my son and his father could not wait to park the car on the side of the road, read them in the car, and read two books in a row. The baby is a hero to Frog, and Frog is looking for treasure very much. I am interested, and I listened very carefully.Maybe the picture is simple and the colors are brighter.After he finished watching, he watched it again on his own in bed, and he saw it carefully.Although he was illiterate, he would still give a rough idea. The content is self-talking, and sometimes I will repeat what Frog said on that page. I think it is a good book. His father also likes it. The father and son often read it together now, and read them all in two days. It's over. 
1	"I’m not a white-collar worker, nor the curvy women in an office building. But this story is as if I’ve experienced it myself. The various buildings in Beijing have been displaced from it. I feel that this story happened by my side. What’s interesting is that Cheng Ruimin is on A book ""There was a man who loved me like my life"" is the protagonist's child. Yes, everyone's life is just a book. See if you have recorded it carefully, and I am moved to suggest that friends take a look. It feels very Wonderful, especially the struggle between my heart and the workplace, which has definitely benefited a lot "
1	This HP machine is well-balanced and has a slightly smaller memory. It would be great if Jingdong sent me a memory. The appearance of the notebook is simple and it is worthy of being a commercial type. The keyboard design is very characteristic. The LED screen display effect is very good, the color is more beautiful. 
1	This book is really good. It should be given a five-star rating. Unfortunately, it seems that the rating cannot be modified. It has the author's personal style and profile, and can learn a lot of health knowledge. Can the author publish another book? If there is such a good book, I will definitely buy it. Thank you Dangdang enthusiastic customers for recommending, I can buy these good books, and thank you Dangdang, I wish good people a happy family and good health! ~ 
0	Do you want to know what is the feeling of heartache? Please check in to know 
1	I stayed for three days from July 25 to 27. Looking out from the hotel room, I can see the sea view and red brick houses. The environment is very beautiful and the service is good. There are small snacks and two flowers every day, which is very warm. Didn’t have breakfast, can’t comment. The TV in the room is not LCD, and the facilities are a bit older, but sitting on the sofa by the window and reading a book, I feel very good. I wanted to take a child to the hotel’s swimming pool, but it was too deep, child Don't dare to go down. The traffic is convenient. There is a bus stop when you come out. You can go to the Zhan Qiao, Zhongshan Park, and Youth Sailing Center on the opposite side. You can go to the May Fourth Square and the Olympic Sailing Center by this side car. I still feel like staying in this hotel Not bad. But later, I went to have breakfast on the 25th floor of Huiquan Dynasty Hotel and found that the scenery is more beautiful, because the hotel is just across the street and is a beach and a training base for youth sailing. In addition, some locals said that they should live in Badaguan, because Some hotels open the door to the beach. You can try next time. 
0	The hotel really feels like a full 2 star, except for the good breakfast, from service to accommodation, none of them can satisfy people a little bit. . . Strange smell in the room... alas 
0	I feel that this book is not as good as imagined. It is a bit too fascinating, and there are not many practical things. On the contrary, there are too many things to write about how people praise God. 
1	When I read this book, I bought it with the idea of buying an inspirational book. Because during that time, I couldn’t get any interest in doing anything. I was very decadent. I felt that my goal in life was very ambiguous and confused. As a college student who had just graduated, I had no practical experience and I couldn’t use much of what I learned in school. There is no advantage except being young. However, in our unit, being young means that you have no experience. Engineering professional experience is very important. After reading this book, I calmed down a lot. Although I am still confused, I already know how to recharge and wait for the opportunity 
1	I read this book when I was very young, and what I read was still a big tome, and the translation at that time was quite original. Very attractive. So impressed. I remember that when I was young, I watched it secretly under the covers at night. That feeling is beyond words. . I was very excited to get the book. The book is also very neat and thick. In short, even holding this book is a feeling. Regained the feeling of childhood. Ha ha. I specially bought the English version, and when I have time, I can browse through the English dictionary at home to taste the original fairy tale. very funny. 
1	The appearance is simple and generous, the configuration is very complete, the keyboard is comfortable, the screen quality is good, the heat dissipation is good, and the noise is good 
0	The bag was hard to find, but I found the 09 models of Samsonite's backs that fit in! Haha, the workmanship needs to be improved. It's a bit worse than ASUS. The foundry is too bad. The CPU cover on the back is up and down like many people! 
1	I read the recommendation before and thought of buying it. After I got the book, I took a look at it. Apart from the beautiful picture, I didn’t understand what it meant! I was still a little bit disappointed at the time. When I got home from get off work, I read the introduction part carefully before I realized it. (Every time I read a picture book, I have to read the introduction. The child looked through it roughly and said it was boring, so I guided him to look at it together. This time I feel different. In fact, as long as you find out with your heart, you will find that every small corner of each page is carefully designed by the author. Great! 
0	The heat is large (including the charger), the camera response speed is slow (I don't know if it is related to the setting), this model does not have fingerprint recognition, you need to increase the memory by yourself. 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
0	It’s a bit more important for girls, it’s troublesome to install the system, no drive disk, trouble downloading, you have to try one by one. . . 
0	This is the worst star hotel I have ever stayed in. It is not as good as a guest house. The rooms are small and damp. There is no table. The most are mosquitoes. They are also very poisonous. My legs have been swollen for a week. The corpse of the mosquito with my blood still remains on the wall. If you have dedication, I suggest you live here. 
0	The workplace is like a battlefield. It’s vividly illustrated in this novel. Lara is as diligent as an old scalper, but his character is more stubborn; Wang Wei is upright but a bit naive; He Haode has a keen thinking and unique vision, but unpredictable. Liszt advocates the moderation and does not like to make decisions, but he is a gentle and discerning boss; Ke Bide is a natural butler, but too harsh; Daixi is too paranoid but unscrupulous but has to admire her courageous perseverance Tony Lin is not as experienced as Wu Wei in business management, but he is exquisite and can control his subordinates firmly. Although John is often quite sinister, he is always against Wang Wei, but he is also a smart person. Li Wenlong is gentle on the surface. But the city is deep and hardworking, but it does not affect his interpersonal relationship in DB, because he knows what is important and what is less, and he is willing to help the people in the group at critical moments; Huang Hong has excellent skills, but the interpersonal relationship is still unable Handle it properly and be careful; Rose is experienced but bleak. There are also Pamela, Zhou Liang, Jason, Helen, Wang Qiang, Roger, Qi Haotian and so on. All of these people have distinctive personalities and their own uniqueness. After reading this book, it is thought-provoking, and the story is fresh and practical. Both newcomers and talented veterans can benefit a lot. 
1	The rooms are old, but the service is good. It is worth mentioning the western restaurant. In terms of food, I personally think that it can be ranked first in the city! 
1	The overall environment is pretty good, it feels like a villa, but the only downside is that the rooms are relatively old. In addition, if you still want to stay in the tourist season, you can’t postpone it. You must check out, which makes it more difficult to find others. The hotel is basically nowhere to go. 
1	I can't help but wonder, if the same thing happened to us, or even to myself, how would we, me, respond? war? Fight? Or escape? It's not how good the Americans are, but the people who witnessed this incident. They really experienced the true sadness and joy. From the text of the blog that they have closed, and from the encouragement of others who cheer for them, I really feel the boundless warmth. 
0	The wireless network card receives poor signals and is unstable, and the heat dissipation capacity is relatively large. I haven't found the advantages yet. Bitter!!! 
1	I like this book very much. The perfect ending made me happy all day. I see their bit by bit, my heart is nervous with them. Seeing the two of them go on vacation together in the hotel...I am really happy, and I wish them even more to see them together. I hope Yan Xi can be with Dr. Ding. But... but I am also very satisfied. This book puts me in a good mood. When I saw Cheng Haoran and Su He, I thought of my boyfriend and me. They are happy, and we are sweeter. There are many classic sentences in the book, I copied them all down. I can appreciate it. So i like this book better 
0	The location is pretty good, just beside the training center of Beijing TV Station, very close to the seaside, but the room is really bad. It is a small room in the whole villa building. The ordinary standard room is pitifully small. It is 13 or 4 square meters. There is no room for two beds. Ctrip's price is cheap, and the service attitude is not bad, but the waiter is very slow. The check-in procedures are basically two. One order in about ten minutes, if not picky 
0	The camera can be found under OSX, but it cannot be used. Bluetooth and wireless use the same button to control, the wireless network card will be affected during the Bluetooth switching process. The hard disk seems to squeak after a while. 
0	This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in! I stayed in the so-called economy room on August 5, 504 yuan/night; the room was very small, and the passage was small and only allowed one leg. There is no door to the bathroom, and there is no door to the shower room. If you can't take a bath, you can quickly get out of the bathroom! Changed another room, still the same. The carpet is dirty! No service! Can't stop it! Don't live it for nothing! There is a feeling of being cut by a big knife. 
0	"I stayed in the big bed room of the hotel on 5/2. Advantages: the hotel is relatively quiet and the surrounding environment is okay. Disadvantages: 1) The hotel is relatively remote, quite a distance from the city and attractions. It is inconvenient to go anywhere, except for those working in the park. 2) The quality of the hotel's service is very average, and the reception desk is very cold. 3) The room is relatively small and the facilities are average. There is only a shower but no bathtub, and the corners of the shower room are very dirty with moss. 4) Many aspects of the hotel are not humane enough. For example, there is no spare toilet paper in the bathroom, and there is only one set of slippers and hair combs in the room. If there are two people, you need to call and ask for another set. 5) The most dissatisfied is the hotel’s air conditioning and related services. When I checked in, I was arranged to stay in room 2211. It was about 7 o’clock when I checked in. The temperature in the room was 26. About half an hour after I checked in, the temperature rose to 27. The air conditioner was operated incorrectly. I read the relevant service manual of the hotel, but did not find out how to use it. (My personal feeling is that there is a problem with the air conditioner in this room, because the air conditioner has two control switches, one to control the wind speed and the other to control the cooling/heating.) Call the guest room center and ask the waiter to take a look. After the waiter came, he checked and set it up for me, and said that there was nothing wrong with my original settings, and asked why the temperature couldn't drop down. The answer was that the central air-conditioning in the hotel cooled slowly. Let me wait and contact the guest room center if it doesn't cool down. About half an hour later, the temperature in the room rose to 28. In order to confirm that it was an air conditioner, I turned off the air conditioner. After about half an hour, the temperature dropped to 26 degrees. (It seems that the air conditioner is heating up rather than cooling down) But it is still too hot. Contact the room service again to report the problem, and the answer is: You can open the window and try. (Since you can only open the window to cool down, what's the use of air conditioning? Can Nian) Let me ask: What about after the window is opened? Neither reluctantly replied: I asked a technician to come and see. Open the window according to the nine o'clock instructions, and the temperature quickly dropped to 26. At about 9:30, the technician came. Without asking any questions, he used a vacuum cleaner to suck the air-conditioning vent. Asked whether it was an air conditioner, and the answer: It should be because the suction vent is too dusty and the air cannot circulate. The temperature will drop after a while. (Even the problem of dust should be prevented in daily maintenance, instead of waiting for the guests to respond, and later it turns out that it should not be the problem that caused the air conditioner to fail to cool and only heat). About an hour after the ""technician"" left, the temperature rose again to 27 degrees (""It seems that the air intake can be used to slow down the temperature rise a little bit""). I contacted the room service this time and replied: We will let the ""technicians"" take a look. A few minutes later, the technician just came back. He first gotten the air outlet and turned off all the lights in the room at his request, saying that the heat of the lights was too high and the temperature could not be brought down. . (It's ridiculous.) Half an hour after the ""technician"" left, the temperature remained at 27 degrees without any signs of lowering. After contacting the hotel again, the hotel reluctantly changed my room, which was already 11 Half. 6) There are many other small shortcomings, which are not listed one by one. Summary: The level of ""technical personnel"" in the hotel is very low, the hotel lacks daily maintenance, and the service staff lack the professional quality they should have. A person’s problem may still be a personal problem, but there are problems in all aspects of the entire hotel, and it should be a management problem. This hotel is strongly not recommended. "
0	I bought it following the trend, but the content in it did not make me read at all.The examples cited were obscure and unreasonable.In short, it was the most failed book I bought. 
0	Personally, I think this book is average, and I haven't got any useful inspiration from it! Is it a problem of translation, or is it a problem of my understanding? Sometimes I don’t know what kind of advice the author wants to give my parents. 
0	"I bought this book and ""Tom Rabbit"" at the same time, this book really can not read, of course its paper and printing are impeccable. The pictures are too cumbersome, and the viewers are upset; the text is even more incomprehensible, and it is not the Chinese speaking at all. The strange thing is that its rating is high, I even doubt my reading level, or my children like it? To be honest, my child only likes the image of the ""little black cat"" and knows that he is afraid of the ""big monster"". But ""Rabbit"" is very popular with my children. As a family, I hope that it does not mislead others. "
1	After reading (Bai Ye Xing), I have a new goal, which is to read all the books written by this author. I don’t really remember where I saw the ending. I just know that the process has been Let me never forget, let me be immersed in the story for several days! I don’t know why, after reading the book, I don’t really want to watch the Japanese TV series adapted from this book. Although many people say to me that TV series are more loving than books, the sadness that the book brings to me is enough. Experience that dark feeling! 
0	That is, after I bought it, I didn’t know how to install Rising Anti-Virus. I didn’t have an ID number. I threw out which package box. Couldn’t I install the ID number? I can’t activate the ID number? Ask an expert? 
1	This is the second book. To tell the truth, the first one looks pretty reluctant, and the second one is slightly better. However, for this book, if you want to understand the history of the Ming Dynasty, this book is not a book that allows you to get history. It should be viewed more in the form of a novel. The author did not clearly express a historical thread, but perhaps, relying on history itself is an attractive place. Slightly better than the first book, I hope it will be more tempting if it continues. This book is like watching a series. It can't be said to be very good, but if you see it, you are willing to continue. That's it. 
0	This book is very popular. Although I don’t like reading books in this area, I can’t help but buy a copy after seeing so many reviews that recommend reading it 
1	It is very far away from business districts such as Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui, even to Ocean Park. Although the room rate is relatively cheap in the hotel, if you want to go shopping, the fare is not cheap, and you have to take the bus and transfer to the subway, which wastes a lot of time. It is a relatively remote place. Although the room environment is good, I dare not choose this hotel next time I go to Hong Kong because the traffic is very inconvenient. And many shops near the hotel closed early. If you want to buy something to eat around 10pm, you don’t know where to go. You can only go to the only nearby Wellcome supermarket that closes late to buy instant noodles. Up. 
1	The business room booked is small and old, but the furniture is very characteristic of the ancient capital. The breakfast is average, but it is served in the revolving restaurant on the 25th floor. The Peony Square downstairs is very good, but the sky in Luoyang is always cloudy. 
0	The US sells XP, and the domestic version has increased by 200 yuan. It would be great if the inner bag had a power adapter. 
1	The price is cheap, the performance is strong, the design is simple and generous, the screen is very comfortable, in short, I have bought 4 notebooks, this is definitely the most cost-effective, super high! ! ! ! ! 
0	1. It generates a lot of heat and needs to be equipped with an additional cooling system, which is really hot to death. 2. The mold quality is really average. . 3. The equipped CPU is too rubbed, the bottleneck of this system is stuck on the CPU, 667 FSB 4. The keyboard is not suitable for fat people, and the distribution is dense 
1	The price is high, and the heat is large. When the weather is cold, you can run a CPU test software to bake your hands. The weight of the machine is also well controlled. 
1	I prefer this writing method. Although citing the classics, it is not boring. I feel that the author seems to be writing in a kind of translation style, putting himself in an objective bystander's perspective. It seems that everything in the book is true, but I Guess that many myths are not human fantasy. Mankind may have had such an era when humans and gods coexist, and there have been magical eras where everything is possible. It’s just that we today will probably not believe it anymore. In fact, is there any? It is just a matter of thought. If you think there is, you can find evidence, if you think there is no, then all the evidence is questionable. 
0	"I bought it because I received a ""recommendation"". There is no content at a glance, it's too foolish. It is better to search for related articles on the Internet. "
0	There is no wireless network card, but there are switches and indicator lights. I opened it and saw that the network card slot and antenna are reserved. 
0	It may be the worst star-rated hotel in the world. There is no TV. There is only one bedside table. The toilet needs to go through the corridor... In a word, the unfinished building is converted into a hotel, and it is not willing to spend money, even for migrant workers. The house is not as good. 
0	The keyboard feel needs to be improved. The driver that accompanies is only Vista, and the XP driver has to be downloaded from the website, which is very inhumane. 
0	Shopping, placing an order, everything is normal, but the book is not received, I call to know that it is out of stock, and there will be no stock in the near future. 
1	I am paying the amount of ￥5,007.00 = Commodity amount of ￥5,099.00 + Shipping ￥8.00-Discount ￥100.00-The balance used is ￥0.00 Price OK! Performance, value, price ratio is very good! ! I installed the win7 32-bit operating system and the drivers have it! Partitioning is not good at first, easy to blue screen. Note 
0	The hardware facilities in the room are okay, the surrounding environment is too noisy, it is not easy to take a taxi in the morning. The main reason is that the service at the front desk is very bad, the check-in time is very long, and it is very difficult to check out the shop. What is the carpet in the room? I burned a new hole, but I swear to God that I didn’t even touch a match or smoke. It made me feel very uncomfortable. The price at the time of booking did not include breakfast, but at the checkout, we did not say that we booked After breakfast,,,, it feels terrible...this kind of service will never go for the second time. 
1	The revolutionary medical concept of this book is to change curative medicine into preventive medicine, and let me know the world’s top health care product USANA, and after taking it for a period of time, it has completely changed my original allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. Years of chronic disease. USANA also provides more targeted top health products. My 3-year-old son is also taking USANA health products for children. I strongly recommend USANA health products (e-mail: tonytong7015@yahoo.com.cn to learn more). USANA may be the best health product in the world, but it is definitely not the most expensive health product. 
0	A colleague recommended this book to me, so I followed Dangdang hopefully to order, but after waiting for two weeks, what was sent was not the book at all. They sent the wrong product again, and I still have it after returning it. I'm quite depressed not to receive the book! 
0	Sometimes when watching a movie, the screen will be black. Just move the mouse and it will be fine. I don't know where to set energy saving. 
0	I don’t know if the sentence in the book is a translation problem or a problem expressed by the author, which makes people feel a bit awkward, and some of the points raised by the author cannot be agreed. 
1	The six-story house that I lived in was not particularly good at first, but the room was good when I moved to the 10th floor. The size is right, although the price is more expensive, but 4 stars is still OK. 
1	Compared with other brands, it has a great comparative advantage. In particular, heat dissipation and silence are beyond the reach of other brands. 
1	White, the piano paint is very beautiful, the sound effect is great, for surfing the Internet, doing some text office, watching movies, as long as it is not a super blockbuster, the key is good convenience. The battery used 5 and a half hours in continuous office 
1	"I am a junior student majoring in advertising design. Last time I went to Nautical Chart with my friend to read a book, I accidentally found the book ""900 Spoken English"". First of all, the cover of this book attracted me. I opened it. The first feeling is that it is cool. Compared with some English books in China, it looks unique, very attractive, and the content is very rich, and some illustrations have been added to make it very easy to read. It feels very worthwhile and very useful. The book is very comprehensive, everything about food, clothing, housing and transportation is covered, very good! ! ! I highly recommend the CD that comes with the book is also good, the pronunciation is very standard "
0	It looks dirty. When I was passing by by the airport bus, I didn't know that I lived in this Home Inn. I still said it was so broken. I got off the bus and walked over and found that I wanted to live here, 555. The order was 180. The business double room is not cheap, but the room is small and the facilities feel old and old. I have stayed in many chain hotels, and Home Inn has stayed many times. Alas, I found that Home Inn is not as good as a family! Unfortunately. The only convenient thing is that it is very close to the Chongqing airport bus station. It is very convenient to take the bus the next day. Additional comment December 23, 2007: Yes, the room still smells. I also think this is a habit of home. Homeinns in Shenzhen also has a peculiar smell. I want to consider other chain hotels in the future. Staying at Qidouxing in Chengdu, I feel much better! 
1	No need to paint. The delivery was very fast. The order placed on the morning of the 25th was received on the morning of the 26th. very satisfied 
1	Although the facilities of this hotel are relatively old and the price is relatively expensive (the small economy standard room is 330), but the breakfast is very good, the service is even better............ The waiter was very insightful and took the initiative to help take things before leaving I wanted to throw the trash in the car into the trash can. I was looking for it. The waiter took the initiative to ask about the situation, and then helped me to take the trash away and throw it away...... After an hour, the hotel called to ask if it was The clothes did not fall to them, but we couldn't go back on the high speed, so we left the address and asked them to send it back. The clothes arrived early the next morning, so I felt that the service was very good, and I called back to thank them... …… This service, compare it with the traffic building, the sky and the underground (the parking is unattended, and the front desk has said that it has not received the order from Ctrip and has not contacted Ctrip. So let me contact me by myself, and give her her mobile phone. The chat was over, so I got angry and went out, but the ten-minute parking security dared to charge me 5 yuan for the parking fee!) The price is higher and the room is smaller. I also recognize it............ I strongly recommend Ctrip. The removal of the Jiaotong Building from the partners is really detrimental to Ctrip's image... I want to comment on the Jiaotong Building, because I was very angry and did not live, so I did not allow me to comment, but I wrote a comment for Ctrip... I also suggest you not Book Jiaotong Building, even if Ctrip recommends............ 
0	It’s a bit inconvenient that you can’t swipe your card for pre-authorization at the front desk. I don’t understand, why can I swipe the card for consumption, but not the pre-authorization? 
0	I have not received the book and asked me to comment on it. I don't know how Dangdang works, and I don't notify when it is out of stock. I know to collect money~~ 
1	I haven't seen the real thing before, and it is no different from what I imagined; beautiful, the keyboard is easy to use, and the function is complete, generally enough for daily Internet use. 
1	The city where the story happened is Dalian, heh...D city, when the author mentioned Hope Square\Qingyun Street\Seaside Square (Xinghai Square)/Exhibition Center (Convention and Exhibition Center), I thought it was so kind, I didn't expect the author to be I was in the same city for a certain period of time. The male protagonist described by the author is really perfect, so I was wondering what Wei Chengchen would look like if he stood in front of me? Why would such an excellent male and female protagonist repeatedly Reject? Why have I never met such a good man? A book that fascinates me. 
0	The screen is a bit soft. Close the lid and hold the machine with your hand. It obviously feels like it is pressed in. This is not as good as the Apple screen that my friend bought. In addition, I don’t know if it’s because I haven’t done it yet, and the sound is a bit harsh. 
0	The attitude of the hotel staff is not very good, the sanitation is average, and because the price is not expensive, if you have the opportunity next time, you may stay. 
1	For self-driving travel, this hotel is very suitable. We are staying on the top floor of Building 2. The scenery and services are very good. Next time we go to Weihai, we will stay at this hotel! 
1	The hotel environment is not bad, the price is good, I think I will live here in the future. 
1	The front desk clerk is polite, the room is clean and tidy, and the hot water does fluctuate, but it has little effect. The price is small and expensive, only worth under 200 yuan. 
1	I heard about Shen Congwen's name and learned it in high school textbooks, but when I really read this book, I made my soul refreshed. Cui Cui’s kindness, grandpa’s simplicity, and the quietness of the town are all inspiring. With the enjoyment of beauty, coupled with the author's tepid and eloquent writing, people really have an impulse to read, wanting to remove their burdens, go out, and embrace nature. Now, when I was undressing and sleeping late at night, I also started to have a Xiangxi dream! There are beautiful girls in the dream and countless things to wash the soul! 
0	"To be honest, I feel there is a certain amount of work. But there is also a lot of nonsense, and there are wheel words. Perhaps it is a common problem with publications in this era. If it were written as ""Those Things in the Ming Dynasty"". It is estimated to shrink by at least 30%. Entry-level TCM acupuncture theory. It's still worth seeing. Personally think it is worth to be online. Not worth buying "
0	"The test software shows that the cpu diode heats up, and it hovered around 62 degrees soon after it was turned on. There is no spring cover when closing; it cannot be opened with one hand, probably because the ""bottom plate"" is too light, ha. The chip crystal board can be seen through a row of heat dissipation holes at the bottom, uh, it feels a bit imprecise. The screen color is too strong "
1	My daughter is six and a half years old, and she reads a little bit shallowly, so she will finish her reading in a while and put it aside. But I find that she often turns up. My colleague saw me buying this book, took it immediately, and sighed as he read it: My daughter (four years old) must like the picture on it, and at the same time it cultivated her interest in mathematics. So he immediately ordered a set. Very good book. If I don’t receive such an easy and interesting mathematics enlightenment education from time to time, I won’t let the boredom of mathematics grow up with me, so that I will go to college and make up the exam for high maths. 
1	The hotel’s facilities are a bit older and are an annex of a four-star hotel. But the service is good, and the hotel prices are very attractive. Will stay next time! Additional comments February 22, 2008: I live in 150. Not bad, no musty smell in winter! 
1	The five-star hotel for Japanese guests is very cheap. As for the environment and service facilities, it should be very good. 
1	After reading the book in one breath, Tang Jun expounded his life experience in a humorous tone, summed up his life experience, and was very enlightening. In addition to inspiration, this is also an inspirational work. Life can be changed, and destiny is in your own hands. As long as you dare to challenge, there are always opportunities. Although everyone's achievements cannot be as remarkable as Tang Jun, and a genius like Tang Jun is rare, at least we ordinary people can strive for the greatest success within our own capabilities. 
1	Very powerful netbook, and it is ASUS. Summarize the following points: 1. Strong battery life 2. Wireless belt n, usually only with g 3. With microphone, Bluetooth, camera 4. There is also a liner bag and cleaning cloth in the box 5. The power adapter is compact (There are also straps on the line). Overall ~ value! 
0	The color of the LCD screen is whitish, and large horizontal lines will appear during the process of lighting and full black conversion. I wonder if it is a quality problem? Or is this machine like this? 
1	I like the bathroom in the room most. Big bathtub. There is also a shower in the bathtub. very convenient. The separate shower room is also very spacious. Will choose in the future 
1	"At first attracted by the title of the book, ""There was a person who loved me like life"". What kind of love is this? Is this love too heavy or unforgettable? With this kind of doubt, after spending most of the day reading it, I felt a kind of uncomfortable feeling in my heart. The two people who loved each other didn't even see the last side, and they were separated by Yin and Yang. . . . . . I really like the words on the cover of the book ""If I was brave at the beginning, would the ending be different? If you persisted, would the memory be different"" "
1	Very nice hotel!! Have stayed for the second time!! This time I used broadband! So fast is unimaginable!! The room layout is also quite good!! The service is also good!! The second check-in manager also called to do it A questionnaire! Haha!! It deserves to be 4 stars! The price is quite reasonable! This is basically the place next time you come 
0	"If the screen is 16;10, and there is Bluetooth, the system originally installed XP, it would be perfect! Haha Fortunately, the official website is very full of drivers, or it is more troublesome! ! The next day I bought it, it changed and I sent a radiator and anti-virus software. Why not give me one! ""_"" Generally worth buying! "
0	The random drive disk is dedicated for VISTA! The official website of the driver for XP is available! However, the driver of the graphics card cannot be installed after being downloaded, indicating that the file is damaged! Go to NVI's official website and download a dedicated one, and it's solved! ! ! Although the sound is stereo, but the sound is very sharp! 
0	No package, no guts, no mouse, the system installation XP requires a higher version of the system disk, it is recommended that you do not easily upgrade the motherboard BIOS. 
0	"The book has been cut, that is, the publisher's editors are more self-disciplined and more enlightened, or they are ""harmonized"". I suggest you think twice about buying this book. And I'll go to Hong Kong to buy the original version. "
1	Notebook + so-called original package + Rising + use 20 yuan Dong? = Price 4279 ￥ The price is very satisfactory. Perfect screen, hard drive power on for 4 hours 
1	"Still pretty good. Especially when reading the first few articles. Calvino is a master of style and article content. He can find good themes from places that others can't notice, and write them with good storytelling techniques. It is indeed extraordinary skill to dissolve the state of the world, philosophy, ancient legends, and contemporary spirit so well. As for the shortcomings, it is the similarity of the story, the more you read it, the more obvious it becomes. Just like the book said, ""Later Kublai Khan discovered that the city Marco Polo talked about was actually the same city."" Between these multiple cities and one city, the processing still makes people feel the same. "
0	The quality of this book is not good. When I bought it, there were pages 146-179 broken in the book. I wanted to give it away right away, but I had to return all of the books, which wasted our time. 
1	The natural environment is first-class, and the interior decoration of the hotel (attached building) is also quite good, not luxurious, but very clean and refreshing. The overall feeling is quiet and freehand. 
0	The mouse sent is too rubbish, it is hard to say, there is noise, and it feels very bad. I can only buy one 
1	I thought it was a very simple and old-fashioned story, but I didn't expect it to make me unforgettable when I read it. Modern urban life is busy every day, with increasing work pressure, but boring and numb. what is love? Can two people really stay together for a lifetime? Very often confused and doubtful. After reading this book, although I knew it was a written story, it touched me a lot. The protagonist’s dedication to love and sincere dedication made my heart full, and life can be dull, as long as I have true love People who work together for a lifetime is enough! 
1	The breakfast is too bad, no matter how many people go there, no food is added there. The hotel should pay attention to this issue. The room itself is good. 
1	1. It looks good, or ThinkPad! 2. The configuration is super powerful, and various functions are readily available; 3. The weight is only 2 kg, which is very light and easy to carry; 4. The original package is of high quality! 
1	Big brand quality guarantees, Jingdong buys licensed goods, with invoices, after-sales guarantees, good machine configuration, good heat dissipation, perfect screen is very important. 
1	Hotel location is very close to Hongqiao Airport. Hardware is also good. Self-rental meal service needs to be improved. 
1	Not bad, I feel great value! JD.com delivered quickly this time! ! ! Not bad, I feel great value! Jingdong’s delivery is very 
1	The location of the hotel is good, close to shopping centers and office areas. I've always lived in Dalian before, but it feels old. During the stay, the hotel is undergoing renovation, refurbishment and upgrading of room equipment. Fortunately, I hope that house prices will not rise too much by then. 
1	The power consumption is really very low. The CPU is only 5.5W after running for a few hours and the bottom is a little hot. The battery is too strong. On the other hand, my Black X61 saw the power drop rapidly for more than 2 hours. The speed of installing win7 in the morning was pretty good, and there was no noticeable delay. 
0	It doesn't feel much, I just think the pictures are quite fun! As for English, as far as I am concerned, I don't want to use this book to improve my English. 
0	Very bad, Samsung’s Ctrip set 290 yuan, said the view room, in fact, can not see anything, even the main road is not bustling. 4 stars near the railway station, the negotiated price is 298. It can only be said that this has become more expensive, and it looks very old and broken, without any garden feeling! The rest is average. 
1	This book covers a wide range of knowledge, close to daily life, suitable for reading and then reading, a very valuable book. My little righteous girl often held the book after receiving it. It is very precious. This set of books will be enough for her to read for a while, after all, the content is rich. There are some knowledge in it. For example, the eating habits are more American, and the mother will be less intuitive when explaining, because the baby cannot connect with real life. There are also typewriters in busy towns. The times are too long, adults have no idea, not to mention Chinese children. It would be great if the Chinese could also produce a set of books like this. 
0	I haven't read this book to the end, I don't particularly like it. I can use the preface evaluation to express my feelings: I can be tolerant, but I don't want to practice. In addition to material, there are many things we want to pursue. 
0	Too small, too tiring to read, not suitable for business machine use; original system is too slow, XP changed, but my level is limited, nondescript; expensive, low cost performance, noon payment, the price drops in the afternoon 100 yuan, depressed. Can you give me more stuff? ? 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, the boot is fast, the Internet configuration is also very complete, the camera, microphone, network card, etc. are all complete. It's very light, so I will take it and run around with it. It is also equipped with a magnifying glass software, so don’t worry about the undersized screen. ! 
1	"A book that my kids and I like very much. The style is fresh and lovely, especially the translation is good, and the sentences are concise and rhyming. I noticed that the translators are mostly children's literature writers in our country. I have seen their names many times in magazines such as ""Children's Pictorial"" before. I think this is also the best part of this book. I bought it together with ""Tom Little Rabbit"". In comparison, the latter focuses more on the child's psychological description and is very detailed. But because of the first-person pronoun, the baby sometimes doesn't seem to understand too much. "
1	I stayed at the hotel on the evening of April 23. The lady at the front desk first gave me a room between the two buildings. I was very dissatisfied. I went to the front desk and changed it. It was okay. I think the hotel shouldn't be the first Good rooms are for the guests first!! I started the tour from Qianshan by ropeway up the mountain. With my children and mother, I really need to rest when I reach the hotel. The location of Paiyun Pavilion is very close, and I think the scenery is the most beautiful Yes! I also went to the Xihai Grand Canyon for a while, it was really beautiful. I feel that if you live in the mountain before or under the mountain, the location of the hotel is exactly half of the location. In the morning, I go to Danxia Peak to watch the sunrise and climb a locked iron gate , Some disappointment. I always feel that the sun comes out from the west when I watch the sunrise! Haha! Huangshan is really good!! Additional comment May 12, 2008: I like traveling. My QQ:410073425 
0	It's not that the content is bad, but the quality of the book. Will Dangdang have pirated books? 146 went straight to 179 and 30 pages were missing. Both returns and exchanges take one month. Crazy dizzy. . Dangdang can't keep the quality of the customers? In addition, make the return and exchange faster and more convenient for consumers? There will be a shadow of buying books in Dangdang in the future. 
1	Good value for money, it seems that the people of Anhui RMB and Jiangsu are much better 
0	The hotel can't provide network debugging services. I worked as a part-time network administrator, ha ha! It was very face-to-face. The weather was cold the day I went. I was a bit uncomfortable at the beginning. I asked for the remote control of the air conditioner and said that I didn’t provide it now; I had to add a quilt and said no, which was very depressing at the time. Two things, very happy. In addition, the front desk is too small and the price is not high. Supplementary comment October 22, 2007: By the way, the front desk does not know the charging standard for long distance calls. 
1	The speed is faster than expected, and you can also use the overclocking mode to increase the CPU speed by 15%. Hard disk performance is also very good. The battery is durable. 
1	The writing is very interesting, the language is very vivid, and I am now immersed in the story of ocean currents (although there is only one story about ocean currents in the book, it will make you start to have a strong interest in ocean currents~~). If there is no atlas (maps are not very useful, atlas, the kind with detailed content), it is best to stop reading, otherwise it will be like reading a book. (Of course I’m talking about ordinary people) Another bad point is that the content of the book may be relatively old. Fortunately, some outdated content has been marked out. The unhappy thing is that the author does not know that the compass is made in China... Of course, every Each era has its limitations, calm... 
1	Now I think it’s worth buying. We’ve listened to it for nearly a month, and we can basically recite the first book, and the second book is already listening. I haven’t recognized the word yet. I listen to it every day at home. Think about it anyway. In the first three years of work, I believe that no matter what, I will always be able to learn everything. More than a thousand vocabulary, the most important thing is the sense of language, and the knowledge of natural science. At least there is always an English environment at home. 
1	Went there for four nights, and the overall feeling is good. First of all, the location is good, very close to Exit B2 of the Yau Ma Tei MTR, and a maximum of three minutes' walk. Secondly, the service is good. I don’t find any discrimination in Mandarin. One day we don’t plan to clean the room. It is estimated that the supervisor and the like will come to the room to knock on the door and ask if we still need to clean for a while; The hygienic aunt was also very enthusiastic and said good morning to us; the doorman was also enthusiastic and smiled at us, which made my mother happy for a day :). The third room is better than expected. It is not too small, but it is clean and quiet. I said that I would live in Chungking Mansions before. Later I went to see it and it was totally unacceptable. Fortunately, I didn't go. The fourth price is not bad, set on Ctrip, 2266 yuan for four nights, 500 yuan deposit. Go live there next time:)) 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
0	Dangdang's service is very poor, together with their customer service is also perfunctory, it is a kind of unsupervised situation, shopping in his house, don't think about solving the problem, this kind of company is not far from closing! Although he is a gold VIP buyer, he will never come again! 
1	Starting from contacting this book, it has aroused my intense concern about the financial crisis and my country's economic development. There are a lot of comments in this regard in the media, but the fundamentals are that the economy has turned for the better, and the financial crisis has little impact on my country, and from the first quarter economic operation data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, this seems to be the case. It is worth noting that in the first quarter of Beijing’s CPI index fell by 0.5%, but the food price index rose by 4.5%. Is this a sign of inflation? After reading the book, I have too many questions about the current economic situation. 
1	帮同事订的，以下是他给我反馈：It was excellent and I can recommend it to anyone else to stay there. My room was on the top floor, the 8th floor and very nice. Suggest always ask for the 8th floor, even though I did not see the other floors. 
0	The self-provisioning machine turns on normally, but the screen has no backlight. Go directly upstairs and find JD customer service. 
1	"Maybe it's because I read too many fast food books now. When I saw this ""Muslim's Funeral"", I was not used to it. The author has a very good writing style, coupled with the delicateness of women, clearly shows the history of the rise and fall of a Muslim family before us. Interspersing the stories of the father and daughter indirectly, it tells the story of this family whose life is jade. Unknowingly, she was attracted to her, and was anxious about the fate of the new moon. It was even more uncomfortable to see her death at last. It can only be said that the author's writing skills are profound. Reading this book is like a good tea. The fast food book is just fast food. "
1	"I've heard about this book a long time ago, and chatted with my friends, I heard that the unspoken rules ""start from the unspoken rules of an actor by the director"". Decided to buy a book to read. I feel that the author has been influenced by the positive history for too long, so I am happy to discover the hidden rules. Read Lu Xun's feelings about cannibalism, and then look at Bo Yang's historical chronology. Non-professionals like me can also feel the darkness of history. Darkness is terrible, but more terrifying than it is getting used to it and bowing to it! As long as we hold high the great banner of Mr. Desai and are not afraid of sacrifice, there will be light in our hearts. There will be light in the world! "
0	I don't know why this set of books is so popular, but I don't feel good about him. For example, I saw the book mentioning that Carmela was peeing in the sea (if I remember correctly), so I bought three sets and returned two sets. The other set was given out. Ugh! I think it’s better to choose character education for children’s education. For example, my best dad and me. Reading this kind of books can cultivate the relationship between children and fathers. Although the quality and printing of this set of books are good, it seems that these contents cannot help children shape their character. If what I said is wrong, I hope to communicate with me privately. sarah.liuhui@qq.com 
1	5699 returns 600 to send a lot of things, cheaper than similar configuration of Shenzhou. I have used a lot of laptops. This is the first time I bought and used it myself. I am very satisfied with the appearance. It also comes with a genuine vista. 
1	The appearance is stylish, and the mouse sent is also very beautiful and easy to use, but the computer bag sent is simply not enough. JD’s customer service said that they were sent randomly and could not be changed. 
0	The portion is relatively heavy. The screen border is too wide. Fingerprints are easily printed on the shell. The blue indicator light is too harsh. There is only one memory slot, which is not convenient for upgrading. 
1	"The comments have been written before. Take a look at everyone's comments, good books are really not used as advertisements! Today, the score is ""5 stars"". "
0	Heat dissipation, headache. The system is very difficult to toss, thinking of this, I think the village still guarantees that the system can be installed. . . Sound card driver tossed for a long time. 
1	The transportation and food here are convenient, the service attitude is good, and the price is good, but the hot water is not too hot, it is recommended. 
1	Nice restaurant, the food is done well, it is worth living here in Weifang 
0	In order to make sure there is no problem, I still choose to pick it up. The keyboard broke when I got the inspection last Saturday, and I can only repair it. 
1	To add some comments, this book is recommended by everyone in the newspaper system. Therefore, when I saw that I purchased this book on Dangdang, my colleagues also asked to buy it. For novices in the industry, it is a very professional guide book. And many old media people who have been in business for many years often have to flip through this book to regulate their news thinking. If you are a person in the industry, you don't need me to say more. If you are a student studying journalism or a newcomer about to enter the industry, please settle down and read it carefully. 
0	The hotel is seriously misnamed. The so-called deluxe business room is a general standard room, and the suite is an extra standard room. The facilities are outdated and seriously fooled. 
0	This book is not very well written. It seems that Du Lala is writing a diary. Many of the content has no substantive inspirational information. It is similar to the situation of ordinary company employees. It only emphasizes how Du Lala has developed step by step. , A bit like showing off your abilities. 
1	"Recalling our QDII, recalling the rhetoric of the year, we have to go to the international capital market to fight hard, and there is a trend of ""riding the wind and breaking the waves when there will be times, and going straight to the clouds and sailing to the sea"". But now, ""holding his hand and looking at his tears, he choked silently."" I also work in a foreign bank. We also sell overseas funds and complex structured notes. Not to mention customers, even we sometimes don’t know it. It now appears that they have designed it a long time ago, and we are nothing but others! "
0	It would be even better if the memory was 2G. When JD.com is looking for a transportation company, can it be delivered to the delivery address? ? ? ? ? ? Or I spent another 20 yuan to get it. . . . . . . 
1	The screen color is good, the keyboard feels good, and the price is quite affordable. The hard disk has a low sound and can generate heat. The most cost-effective netbook. 
0	I think most people bought this book because of Ailing. The general feeling is not good. Maybe there is only a little value. If you want to study Zhang Ailing, you might as well take a look. The character is poor and Ailing is more unjust. However, it can also be realized that this population must be good. On the outside, the quality and accomplishments are good, and the knowledge range is also wide. The typical scholars in the late Qing Dynasty belonged to the kind who linger on the Qinhuai River. 
0	It feels unstable, and a blue screen appears once after twelve days of use (ten hours after power on). 
0	I saw the evaluation of this book from the Internet today. The content is about Bailong’s boss Sun Yingui maliciously owing the relevant money to the Yanjiao construction site. The process and content of the written complaint by the other party was shocked after reading it. Originally read Boss Sun’s After the <Law of Fairness>, I felt that the content of the book seemed to justify or justify myself (the story of turning against my brother and the story of telling my failure to invest in Chishui). I heard that this incident is both unexpected and reasonable. How can a person who kills one another with his brothers for money, and a person who defaults on workers' payment to vent his anger, can be equated with a person with a sense of social responsibility! As small as his own family, as large as his opponents in society Is his business fair? Sun Yingui is too talented? It, fooling readers who don’t know! Sun Yingui is too rich? It’s a distorted truth of hype! This may be called a kind of fairness for the rich, right? !...(In the response to each book review of Dangdang, there is a detailed introduction about this matter) 
0	I bought something on Dangdang a few times, and it feels not very good. There are always some minor problems in the service. I placed an order on the 19th, and I called on the 24th to still pick up the goods, and your website clearly stated that it was in accordance with the regulations. Delivery within 2_5 days. The record shows that it was not sent out until the 30th. What kind of service is this, terrible. Last time there was a problem with the item and I had to return it, I asked if I could return the item earlier, and the customer service staff answered no, only 5 (7) Processed within working days. I waited 2 weeks to call the customer service staff and then delayed for a few days to solve the problem. It feels that the regulations are made for customers, and the company staff does not matter, which makes people lack of trust. Customer service is a service attitude Very good, but who is boring and has nothing to look for customer service. I think most rooms have very low requirements, as long as you do what you promised, it is right. I don’t want you to do it perfectly.. Improve it well, otherwise you will have a few more In this world, I don’t know if Dangdang is available. 
0	The hotel facilities are bad, which means that broadband Internet access will never be available. As it was in October last year, Ctrip still does not cooperate with hotels like Homeinns...The most annoying thing is three points Arriving at the hotel (the small alley is very difficult to find, in a dilapidated alley that needs to be demolished), it is said that there is no room, and you can only move in after 6 o'clock. Later, I learned that they rented out the room for the hour for profit As a result, the guest was late to check out, so we were asked to wait. At the beginning, we refused to say. It was because we asked many times, they were impatient, and they told us the truth... and they obviously felt that they were about the customers brought by the dealer. It doesn’t matter at all, and doesn’t care about the service attitude. Other guests staying by themselves are very enthusiastic. I don’t understand. We pay no less than others. Why should we be treated like this. In addition, every time we book a room with Ctrip, As long as you book a room on a higher floor, it is basically the bottom floor. If it is a business floor of 2-4 floors, it must be given to the second floor. It is also the Overseas Chinese Hotel in Hangzhou. I will also go up and see After that, the room is vacant, but it just won't give us... the tour group that came at one o'clock in the morning, all stayed on the 4th floor... the front desk at the front door is the first and a half, but fortunately, the first floor is not reserved Because the first floor is the basement, with a long and narrow window like a prison, the room is more cold and damp...then the second floor here is also the first floor...sufficient...said it is the transportation and its convenience, walk to The front door also takes 15 minutes...As for the facilities, other things are not discussed, the bed is simply outrageous...You can clearly feel the aging springs one by one torment your back, sheets and The sheets are trendy, and I doubt that they have properly and clearly replaced...such a partner, Ctrip will also be willing to cooperate...it is puzzling...don’t take you because of these suppliers My own sign is broken!!... 
0	"I booked an extra bed in a standard room of this hotel on Ctrip in early May, and the reservation price was 320+100. When I checked in on the morning of May 13th, I was told that there was no room and I had to wait for noon. When I asked if it was a standard room or a triple room, the lady said impatiently that she would give us priority to prepare a triple room. Back to the hotel at noon, the lady at the front desk said that the standard room had not been cleaned, so she recommended us to change to a triple room. When I asked about the price, the lady first vaguely said that the price of an extra bed in a standard room was about the same, and then said four in general. More than a hundred, and finally I checked the computer impatiently and quoted 420, so I moved in. The breakfast buffet on the 14th was richer, and the attitude of the waiters was better, but on the 15th it was very different. The porridge was cold, the soy milk was gone but there was no waiter to add, and the variety was much less. The waiters were happy together Talking in the ground without paying attention to what the guests have. (When I left the store on the 15th, I noticed ""Celebrating the victory of the first Nanping Science and Technology Fair held on May 13"" at the entrance of the hotel, so I suddenly realized.) Checking out on the morning of the 15th, when I swiped my card, I suddenly found that the amount was 470 yuan per day, so I asked At the front desk, I was told that the triple room was the price. I insisted on calling the waiter who was on duty on the morning of the 13th. I didn't expect the lady to change and say that the price for us on the 13th was more than 400. I said at the time that it was not a question of how much money, but a question of business integrity. I don’t know what it’s like to watch the visitors, but as far as I am concerned, I will never go to Wuyishan again. Even if I do, I will never live in such a hotel without basic integrity and endure the punctual harassment of the lady every night. Up. "
0	I read the many good reviews on the Internet and decided to buy it. I didn’t expect to be disappointed! I just categorized some commonly used English words. It didn’t help me at all, and no one else said it was funny and funny! When I was in junior high school, my English teacher taught us to classify English words. Very general... 
0	It's not as good as it was advertised, and there is no practicality, and no entertainment value. Now no one is smashing the wall. I really don't know, what do you do with this book??? 
1	Originally, the system was equipped with DOS, but the received version was genuine Vista 2. Originally, the hard disk was 250G, and the received was 320G. 
0	Comment on a bird~~~~~ I ordered three times and complained but never sent it to me twice. I don’t even know what the book looks like! Every time I complained, I just said I’m sorry. I didn’t solve the problem at all. I didn’t have a book and I just mailed it to others. It took three months before and after. I ordered a few times, forget it, no more. . 
0	The front desk service is okay, the room is really not good, the air conditioner is very noisy, the bed is actually high on one side and low on the other, this price is really not worth it, I will not choose it next time. 
0	Why am I buying an old book? There was a lot of random writing on it, and the CD was wrong. I bought Business English, and the CD is for Life English. What kind of broken B stuff does Dangdang sell! The staff grew up eating S? 
0	The hotel facilities are OK, the service is super poor, and the service attitude is also very bad. We originally had a meeting here, but it was difficult to communicate with each other. 
1	The location is OK, there are some big food stalls near the West Lake, and eating is more convenient. The hotel service is very good, the waiter and the front desk staff are very friendly, the room is big and clean, the price is high, if you go to the West Lake next time you will stay. 
0	The camera is a bit short. When the screen is 8.9, the full-size keyboard looks a bit uncoordinated, and there is no way to have both fish and bear paws. Haha. 
0	The LED screen and the plastic shell outside the screen are not really pressed? From the side, there is a big gap, pressing the shell and the screen, the gap is reduced. Can this be exchanged? Running speed is too slow. The price cut is too fast. 
0	Relatively speaking, compared with the hotels in Dongguan and Shenzhen, the service quality of this hotel is still slightly flawed. Slightly lacking enthusiasm and politeness, a little indifferent. For example, on the last night of staying at the hotel, they forgot to give new slippers. I made a total of three calls before sending them. Looking at the hotel environment at that time, it didn't seem to be very busy. 
1	The format of the text and pictures is very large, the characters and pictures are very large, and the pictures are also very good. It can be seen that the editor has worked hard on this set of books and the content is very good. It is very interesting and warm to read. I can feel the idyllic and romantic atmosphere of Germany. It is very comfortable. I like it very much: only friendship that can withstand the test of snowstorm is true friendship. They like Venus, my son likes the moon, and my child lives with a dream. , They love the moon and the stars so much. When I am always with them, I think the moon is beautiful when it comes out! Haven't finished reading yet, go ahead! 
0	The writing is average, not as good as recommended. If you can read some in the bookstore, I don't think I will buy it. 
0	I am very dissatisfied with the Xinyuege Inn. If there is a zero point to choose, I would rather not give it a point. Their service is too bad. It clearly includes breakfast, but the waiter didn’t know at all in the morning, or I took it early in the morning Rain went out to buy it. Even more chilling and annoying: On the morning of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the waiter sold the room to others without our knowledge, and drove me and an American couple away. I talked about this with several inns around me and everyone was shocked that there are such people! I strongly recommend that you don't live here from now on. And the price is twice that of a nearby inn. 
0	This set of cats and mice was originally intended to be given to friends, but more than ten sets were delivered for the first time. Every one of them was well packaged and the quality was problematic. According to the delivery, it is more troublesome to exchange the goods. It is better to return the goods directly and place the order again. This is repeated several times, but the quantity I want has not been delivered. No way to complain! ! ! ! Sadly! ! ! ! But in general, this set of discs can only be said to be of high quality and low price. After reading it, it is found that it is not genuine and the image quality is average. Give it to you to think clearly! 
0	When I first took it, I didn't find any problem with the screen. After I took it home, I found a small red dot in the upper right corner. I was not lucky enough, but it did not affect the use. When I used it later, I occasionally stuck when watching a movie, and I didn't know what was wrong. 
1	"I just took the exam today. The designated book for the exam is this ""Fifteen Lectures on Aesthetics."" All in all, this book is quite good. The content is simple to deep. The language is simple and easy to understand. It does not use very professional terminology to discuss issues. Instead, it uses examples to demonstrate opinions and covers the main research issues of aesthetics. It is a great book for anyone who wants to dabble in aesthetics. However, as a professional review, this book is not very good. The views in this book are scattered, and noun concepts are often not given precise definitions. "
0	"Very useful for children, but for me, I think I bought the wrong book. ""College student friend"" refers to freshman students such as high school students, junior high school students, not college students. Dangdang's service is still very good, like one. "
1	It feels very good and looks very classic. Added 1G memory, changed to XP, it runs very fast. No problem found for the time being 
1	"I have read a lot of books on this aspect of mind. But this one, with its beautiful and gentle text, has brought me to this book both physically and mentally. Word by word, like reading a textbook, carefully ""eat"" in. Long-lost good book! It should be said that there is such a good book! I haven't finished reading it yet, I guess I will always keep it by my pillow and take it out to read it at any time, even if it is a textbook of my life. Thanks to the translator, with such soft words, gently knocked open my heart. This will be a book that will change my life. . . . . . "
0	The loudspeaker volume is not very large, the treble is a bit small and the bass is insufficient, if the environment is not too noisy, it can cope with normal use 
0	1. The doorman is unprofessional. We arrived at 10 o'clock in the evening. When we got off the rental, no one would open the door without saying, even the box had to be taken by ourselves. 2. The room is too small and the bathroom is also small, unlike the four-star standard. 3. When I checked out, I said that the two bathrobes were missing. We never saw a bathrobe when we checked in. Also want to ask the hotel! 4. Check-in and check-out are slow. In short, I will not check in again if I go there later. 
0	I didn't understand the installation system at first! After knowing it a little trouble! It feels very simple! ! ! Not bad! ! ! 
1	I just bought this computer. I turned it on at the self-pickup point, and found that the keyboard was broken, and one of the buttons was about to fall off. No matter the self-pickup point, please contact the return and exchange department. The return and exchange department said that the keyboard is broken. , Let go to HP to replace the new keyboard. If something goes wrong with what you just bought on JD.com, you have to run around to repair it. They have completely pushed the responsibility away. Now they will accept it unless you issue an HP inspection report. 
1	The hotel is opposite to the scenic spot of Big Buddha Temple, it is easy to find when it comes to high speed. The big bed room in the VIP building of the hotel is big and clean, and the view from the window is not good. There is a computer but 35 yuan per day, you can use your own books for free. The breakfast buffet is very good among four-star hotels, with a wide variety of food and fresh and delicious. The attitude of the waiter is also very good. At the end of the breakfast, he will ask the guests first, and then withdraw. The check-out speed at the front desk is average. 
0	I bought it after reading everyone’s comments, but when I got the book back, the child was not very interested. I was always absent-minded to tell him, wait until he gets older. 
0	Jingdong related answers are wrong, not LED backlight screen, keyboard is not piano paint, wireless network card is Intel 5100! Please Jingdong to correct it. The other shortcomings are that the hard disk is a bit smaller, but it's enough! 
0	For girls in their twenties, I personally feel that the content of this book is not suitable, some are too simple, and a bit tacky, and it takes less than ten minutes to read it. 
1	I booked a double room, but the so-called double bed is only 1.5 meters wide and the room is quite big. It is worth recommending the buffet, which is good for hotel guests at 50 yuan/person. But the waiter in the restaurant rarely sees a smile, and doesn't pay much attention to the greetings of the guests, not good. 
1	"Although I am not yet a mother, I have several books on how to raise children, some of which are works by friends, and some are left in the office. I bought this ""Girl with Self-Esteem"". First, I like the cover, and second, I like the ""100 suggestions"" on the cover—for a busy person like me, it's better to give me suggestions instead of letting me read long. I bought it and put it on the bedside and looked at it for an hour. The facts proved that my eyes were not biased. It's a preview in advance. After I have a baby in the future, I will tell him that my mother learned how to love you from this book. "
1	Under the original configuration, adjust the power management of this book to high-performance mode, run 3D mark 06 at 1440*900, and score 4100+. It is basically enough to play games. 
1	"I admire Mr. Xiao Lin very much. He cares for every student in Ba Academy with the heart of loving and discovering children. When can I become as good at discovering the beauty of children as he is, instead of ""not having a grain of sand in my eyes"" when I start education now. In Teacher Xiaolin’s heart, every child is innocent, every child is kind, and every child has the right to enjoy life freely, but our current educational environment is difficult to give children what they really need~~ ~Sorrow~ "
1	Except parking is not very convenient, everything else is good, the quality of service is also very high, the environment in the city center is also very attractive, not bad! 
0	One word, bad, cold, no heating. Air conditioning is too bad! 
1	The order is: aluminum alloy shell, upgradeable 2-year warranty (not verified), long standby time, large keyboard, Gb network card, genuine vista. 
1	This is the second time I have stayed. Because of the need for a business trip, there is indeed no other place to live in Anqing. The overall environment of the hotel is elegant and the room facilities are average, but the hygiene is okay. After each stay, I am used to check whether the bed is tidy. During a recent business trip, only this hotel did not find any foreign objects such as hair remaining on the bed. 
0	Because it was a book I saw when I opened Dangdang.com, and I saw the online reviews and thought it was pretty good, I even bought it. But after reading a few pages, this book is of no interest to me. Mainly do not like the writing style of this book. 
0	The novel has been read a long time ago. I bought it only for collection. The hateful thing is that Dangdang didn't pack this book in a plastic bag. It doesn't feel brand new, and there is a crease on the back cover, which affects the mood. 
0	Except that the lobby is like a listed five-star hotel, there are really no other ones that can meet the standard. Outdated facilities, such as poor carpets, and dirty! The bed and quilt are similar to those in ordinary small hotels, and the bathroom is also average. In short, I feel good in the lobby. When I get to the room, I find that I was fooled by the lobby! 
0	"The location of the hotel is good, but the room is really bad. I didn't book a river view room, but I didn't expect that the window of the room was facing the corridor! It was extremely hot, and there was a problem with the wardrobe lights and no one had repaired them. The Chinese restaurant went to work too late, the western restaurant was unpalatable and expensive, the breakfast variety was small, and the amount was pitiful. On the last day, there were hairs on the bread. I called the waiter several times, but I said it was ""icing sugar"" perfunctorily. Not so stupid! Only the doorman is cute. "
0	How about 200 yuan extortion for one XP? ? Besides, it’s weird to say that foreigners only use a C drive??? 
0	1. There is noise. 2. The layout of the keypad area is different from that of an ordinary notebook, and needs to be adapted. 3. The P1 button turns on the camera. I didn't know at first, but I couldn't install the driver and couldn't find the camera. Later I found the secret on the Internet. 4. Adding memory will destroy the warranty sticker. 
0	Jingdong’s logistics is maddening. The order placed on the 4th has already been received, and the other order has not yet been delivered in Beijing. The efficiency is not normal. 
1	The environment is good and the room is very clean. The quality of the service staff is very good, the attitude is very good, and the checkout is fast. If the hotel staff can see this, it is recommended that the meal coupon can be reprinted. I was misled to the 4th floor during breakfast. A bit unhappy. 
1	Women love to be beautiful! The more clothes you wear, the less you wear, the more you go through the seasons! Before the summer, I took off my heavy clothes and changed into summer clothes. I showed my arms and legs in the winter. I don’t want to hesitate to tremble with the cold, but I don’t want the cold and moisture to invade the body and plant the bane. Day after day, year after year, when our body is occupied by more and more cold and moisture, we feel uncomfortable, pain here and there, and finally can’t bear it. Seeing a doctor becomes commonplace, and finally we are in the hospital. For home. It can be seen how important it is to keep warm, especially for us women! 
1	The waiters are of high quality, better than many 5 star hotels in the country! The facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained and clean! The price of the catering is moderate! One night, the workers polished the floor and it was very noisy. After negotiations, the construction was stopped, and the lobby apologized and delivered on the second day 1 fruit plate, I apologized again at the front desk during checkout. I really didn't say anything about their service attitude, just one word: good! The snacks on the floor are very warm! The breakfast has Shandong characteristics, which is very good! A shortcoming: the room Soundproofing is a little worse! Additional comment July 22, 2008: Close to the trestle bridge, beautiful exterior scenery, worth staying! 
0	No hotel stay, stayed again. Miss harassment changed from once at 8 o'clock to twice, at 9 o'clock in the evening, and at 12 o'clock in the evening. I was asleep, so angry I wanted to call the police. The front desk told me that this is not the responsibility of the hotel. It's so funny, no other hotels are harassed by girls, just the overseas Chinese girls jump up and down, which is more powerful than a mouse. This time there was a female colleague who came with him, but the female colleague in the next room did not receive any harassing calls. Should I admire the lady’s IQ or should I scold the hotel for selling guests? 
0	I stayed here for one night on February 2. As there is something to deal with, I did not check out until 4pm. According to the hotel’s front desk sign: Check out after 12 o’clock, a fee of 20 yuan will be charged for every more than one hour, and a maximum of 50% of the room rate (refunded before 6 pm). In this way, I should pay another 80 yuan. When the payment was made, the service staff (the manager was also there) insisted on charging me half a day's room rate (178 yuan for the whole day). I just fought hard based on what they said in the notice, and later, they approved my point of view on the surface. Then let me swipe the card to checkout. Since his terminal did not show the specific amount of money, I entered the password and confirmed it. As a result, the printed sign is only 89 yuan instead of 80 yuan. I refuse to sign the sign. (Later I asked China Merchants Bank, and the bank said that as long as it was printed out, it was valid, regardless of whether it was signed or not! I wondered, what is the use of the signature on the sign?) The service staff, including the manager, were secretly happy when they saw their tricks succeed. I feel very angry, for such unreputable employees and their backwardness. I don’t want to think about it. Consumers also have distrust of their company because of their own immorality. Is this result comparable to a mere 9 yuan? Later, I complained to the main store and received a call from the store manager about an hour later. The basic meaning is that there are two options, 1. I go to the store and get 9 yuan (and I am already waiting to board the bus in the Wuchang waiting hall at this time!) 2. Next time I will stay in this store and make up for me. And settle with me at a much more favorable price than written. I thought to myself, it's really boring. I'll get it? is it possible? I asked for more than 40 round trips to rent, let alone my time. Next time? is it possible? Don't talk about your shop, I will not choose the whole Yangtze River. This kind of cleverness, deceiving consumers, ultimately determines that Yangtze River will be a company with no prospects. Everyone should consider carefully before moving in, and don't encounter unnecessary troubles like me because of your good wishes. 
0	JD’s price protection is not easy to use. There are many restrictions. It dropped by 100 the next day after placing the order. I consulted the customer service and said that it was possible to apply for price protection, but when the goods were picked up, I told you that you cannot apply for price protection because the gifts are different. It is depressing to spend more than 100. Installing XP is...exhausting! 
1	Although the ending is in the image, it still follows the author step by step into the hole. Obviously knowing that the dead cannot be resurrected, the dogs cannot speak, but they are still paranoid like the protagonist who almost believes the sinner's lies. The moment the truth came to light was still a shock in my heart. Fortunately, everything became clear in the end. A dog, a person, life still has to go on, beauty has just begun. The delicate description of the novel is a plain style that attracts me. Suspense from time to time makes people have a strong interest in reading. After reading it, I cherish my relatives even more. Let them know your love! 
0	The quality of the disc is not good, and the screen keeps flashing, which is particularly bad for children's eyes, so after I bought it, I kept it there and didn't look at it. I think Dangdang should sell good quality discs. . 
1	Bluetooth, WIFI, camera, SD card reader, and E card socket expansion. 1G memory, 250G hard disk. The standard 10? screen resolution of 1024*600. It's really complete. 
1	The big bed room is not bad, I haven't seen the others. The location is good. Hope the dishes are better 
0	The feelings of staying in are as follows for your reference: 1. A typical state-run guest house, with nothing but a small commissary. 2. The room facilities are outdated and there is no feeling of staying in a hotel. 3. There is no service, the TV remote does not work, after calling the front desk, it was not delivered until leaving the store. 4. There is no towel in the bathroom. I suggest future friends not to live here. In addition, I hope that Ctrip will evaluate hotels and do not recommend shops that do not meet the requirements, otherwise it will cause inconvenience to guests. 
1	This set of books can really be said to be my enlightenment textbook for the history of the Chinese revolution. Although I have learned it many times before, it still keeps me from being interested. This set of writing is very attractive, and many questions that have been confused before have been answered. It seems that no matter what knowledge is learned, interest is really important. If you are learning knowledge while reading some related books (preferably interesting, But don’t talk nonsense), it will really help a lot to have a deeper understanding of what you have learned. This book uses contrast to show us the different leadership styles of Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek. novel! 
0	Dangdang's service is very poor, together with their customer service is also perfunctory, it is a kind of unsupervised situation, shopping in his house, don't think about solving the problem, this kind of company is not far from closing! Although he is a gold VIP buyer, he will never come again! 
0	MSI closed the screw hole for the warranty, and there is no way to upgrade the memory. Another shortcoming is JD. Actually, none of the many product pictures can show what it looks like with the battery installed. 
0	It's just that many reserved interfaces on the notebook make people feel too sad. Low-cost books will not leave so many wounds. 
0	I really don’t have the ability to resist the current cosmetics. As soon as the store advertises and others say it’s good, I get dizzy and follow the trend to buy it. In fact, the simplest things are also the best. After reading this book, I pay more attention to recuperation from the inside out. 
0	The attitude is super bad. I booked a normal standard room, but I said that I didn’t have it. I said that I had a free upgrade to the deluxe double standard. I must have a network cable. The next day I told me that I can’t use the Internet, and the room is in the annex. Far away, my things are so heavy that no one cares about a girl who resists like this. The next day I said that I would change rooms, but the cleaning staff was stunned that they could not understand the Mandarin spoken at the front desk, and asked me to walk back and forth with my luggage, not knowing what I was doing! ! ! ! As a result, I changed it twice and changed to a standard room. I was afraid that the standard was not as luxurious as it was. As a result, I found that it was not only in the main building, but also much better than the previous day's luxurious! ! ! ! ! ! At least the windows are big and the network cable works! I was very dissatisfied with the first day of check-in and felt cheated! ! ! 
0	98 processes running on 1G memory are as slow as a snail under vista. The total is not as good as imagined. 
0	Installing the system is too difficult! I can’t install even more than N versions of XP, but later I installed VISTA with a killer tool, and it worked! 
1	I only rested in the hotel for a few hours, did not have time to eat breakfast, and did not see the so-called 10 yuan meal voucher. The facilities in the room are quite rich. In a relatively new hotel, the bed in the standard room is too small, which is a bit nervous for the bulky guests. The sense of service at the front desk is still good, next time you should enjoy the hotel's service. Hotel feedback August 4, 2008: Thank you for your review. The hotel will value your suggestions and continue to improve its products. We look forward to your coming again, staying experience, and giving us more suggestions. Thank you! 
1	Advantages: The appearance is stylish enough, the configuration is very good, the price is reasonable, and it is very suitable for business use. Disadvantages: The optical drive occasionally sounds really loud, and the bottom generates a lot of heat. Summary: The special price of 4999 is still very good value, it is worth it 
1	XP is installed and it feels good. All drivers are officially provided, and the drivers for various shortcut keys are also fixed. It's very fast and very good. 
0	I live during the Spring Festival, the location is good, the transportation is convenient, the surrounding environment is also good, and the shopping is very convenient. The room is large and the bathroom is oversized. I feel that it is a waste of space and the room is old. General front desk service. Breakfast is only dumplings stuffed with leek and pork and rice soup. The worst hotel breakfast I have ever had. The elevator is scary. But the old man on the first floor is very kind. 
0	I was really disappointed. I hoped to increase my vocabulary, but the words are too small and the content is too messy after opening it. It is not suitable for my beginner level. Is there a zero-based introductory book? If you can change to another book! 
1	For the first time shopping on JD.com, I chose such a big item, and the result did not disappoint me; the look is classic; the performance is good. 
0	Went in October. It doesn't feel very good. The room is similar to Home Inn, but it feels so bad. The most unbearable thing is that the window is so close to someone's balcony. You can see the inside of other people's homes! ! There are still people making noise in the corridor in the middle of the night. The waiter should stop it. There is also the central air conditioner. After taking a bath, I was still hot and sweaty. Check out is not fast! ! 
0	The things that have just arrived, the running time is too short, and the obvious defects have not been exposed yet. Hope it will last! 
1	I first learned about Xue Yong because of his blog. Later I learned that there was such a book, so I decided to buy it and read it. Some of the author's views are difficult for many Chinese to accept, but the fact is that you will not compromise because you do not accept them. The author is simple and has a clear point of view, which is very helpful for us to understand our lives, not only in terms of educating children. If you can read it carefully, you will be able to realize a lot of things. I am responsible for the above words. Welcome everyone to contact and communicate with me before purchasing.

0	The content is average, too single! I think education is not very profound. There are not many Liezi in real life, it is meaningless! 
0	The elevator is too slow and it takes a long time to go up and down. It is inconvenient to enter the room with a card card. It takes many attempts to open the door. Conditions are too general! The price of Ctrip is exactly the same as the front desk price. 
1	The room is relatively clean and comfortable! Songjiang has fewer business hotels! This hotel is ok! 
1	Small and cute, the brightness of the LED screen is not bad, and it starts quickly. The battery is almost five hours 
0	It is purely a self-defense book, fooled! The content is simple, and the author is always eloquently defending himself. It is purely a book of hype and packaging! 
0	The typical kitsch and entertaining texts written in a ridiculous tone to cater to the taste of the public are wordy and disgusting. 
1	I stayed in the retested sea view suite. The sea can be seen from the balcony. The sound of the waves is heard in my ears while lying on the bed at night. I feel good, and the waiters have a good attitude. The downside is that the traffic here is not convenient. Average 
1	The overall configuration is good; the appearance is also very beautiful; it has been used continuously for more than ten days, and it is still stable; sending Logitech mouse, other small accessories, such as screen wiper, cable winder, etc. also make people feel very considerate and good service. 
1	Very good hotel, nothing said about service. After arriving at the store, I knew that it was our first time staying. We were upgraded to an apartment for free. The facilities in the room are very good. I like the decoration style very much. The front desk sent us into the room, and the waiter helped us change slippers and make good coffee. The only regret is that the parking lot is relatively small and there are few sofas in the lobby, which makes it very empty. I will definitely come here next time I have a chance. 
1	This book is very good and worth reading, especially for men and women who are in love, as well as married couples, or who want to have a deeper understanding of the opposite sex, all need to understand the content in this book, understand the opposite sex, You will win the whole world. If you understand people of the same gender, you will only win half of the world, but after you understand people of the same sex and the opposite sex, you will understand the world and do everything. So this book is the key to your happiness and it will win you life. As long as you want to have a deeper understanding of the opposite sex, you must read this book. 
0	I haven't read Teacher Bi's book before, because I am more interested in psychology, so I chose this book first. After reading it, I was disappointed and I was not interested in buying her other books. I think this book is not well written. Is the growth of a psychologist so simple? Is it really possible to have any level, as long as there is a heart? After reading it, do you dare to go to these so-called Chinese psychologists? Honestly I dare not! 
0	The location of the hotel is a bit more than stated in the address description, close to the outskirts of the city, not even a clear sign on the roadside, disappointed. The appearance of the hotel is decent, but the lobby is very mediocre (a bit like the lobby of a hotel), and the decoration of the corridors and rooms are relatively old, far from the pictures released by Ctrip. Toiletries are poorly equipped, probably at the level of Samsung. At the same price, it is much worse than the Guangzhou Royal International Hotel near the Tianhe Shopping Center where you used to live, in terms of decoration, service, and even buffet breakfast. When I made a reservation, I couldn't remember the specific name of the Royal International Hotel, so I booked this hotel. I really regret it. I won’t choose here again when I go to Guangzhou, never~~ 
1	Very nice hotel, first-class service, the staff are very dedicated, whether it is the front desk, the service desk, the porter or the driver, they are very enthusiastic and polite. On the last day, the hotel learned that I was on a flight at more than five in the afternoon and took the initiative to check out The time was delayed to three o'clock, and a bus was arranged to be delivered to the airport. This is the first time I have stayed in so many hotels. 
1	I finally bought this book. The cover is very good, and the book is well done. The editors have worked hard, and they will definitely collect it. Many of the cases mentioned here may happen around me, and they are really good for me. It is of reference significance. I also recommend everyone to take a look. There are so many things to learn in the workplace. 
1	Du Lala has been fired up recently. Many people say that she is a guide for newcomers in the workplace, but I think it might be more appropriate to look at this book with a calm and calm mood. It may be due to the nature of the job, I don't feel that I have benefited a lot. In all fairness, it is a new type of workplace novel, and it should be more relevant. For the climax part of the novel, it seems to be the end, I always feel a little bit unfinished. But in the process of watching, the whole mood is still very good. 
0	Too horrible, the attitude of the front desk is very bad (but the doorman is still very enthusiastic), the room left for us is 1404, let her change, said no, also emphasized that there is no such taboo in Chongqing. I stated that I would stand at the front desk until they changed rooms. Seeing this, she said that a room for someone is always 1408 (the room types of 1404 and 1408 are the same, there is no taboo, why not leave 1404 to that person! Annoying! Bullying our Ctrip netizens!) Change to us first. Comrades, LP and I arrived at the hotel at 12 midnight. We got the room number 1404. I looked at the clock on the wall~ Khan~ 
1	This book is very practical, more suitable for parents and teachers to read, and then instruct children or students. The composition method in the book is very reasonable. It can be seen from the book that the author is not only good at writing, but also has a lot of experience in first-line teaching composition. Other composition methods may be empirical, but he The theory more combines theoretical knowledge. It is very happy to teach children composition in his way. The most important thing is that parents should have the patience to guide and accompany their children to experience and accumulate various experiences. It is not difficult to write a composition. worth buying. 
0	Your price is really vomiting blood! I bought 5398 yuan on June 15 and the price fell to 4999 yuan on June 16? ? The price drops by 400 yuan a day! ! So anyone will dare to shop online with you in the future? .........The temperature of the machine's vent is a bit high! 
0	The 16:9 15-inch bag is not easy to buy at present. The previous 15-inch bag can't fit, and the USB port design is a bit unreasonable. 
1	"Fragile time can also accomplish great things. Work is not distinguished between high and low. Being a customer is like falling in love. Not only do you have to make good friends, but you must also make details. Details determine success or failure. People gather popularity and make money. Medical representatives should do Good medical work depends on ""rituals"" and ""grinding"" to integrate good destiny and details. You will surely find a breakthrough for yourself. "
0	Ctrip's use of such a hotel is really a discount to its own brand. Please Chinese people can pay attention to the brand awareness that they have cultivated so hard. Such a hotel is really bad and there is no way to describe it. I checked out after staying for one night. It is simply a county. In the guest house, the faucet in the bathroom was only fixed with a nail. It was impossible to take a shower at all. It could only be described by a dirty word. I would never stay in such a hotel again. 
1	Old brand, good price/performance ratio Although Zhongguancun has a better price, I finally chose Jingdong 
1	The hotel environment, facilities are good, the space is relatively large, there is an LCD TV, the price should be pretty good in Hong Kong. The traffic is quite convenient, the bus is more convenient, but it seems to be far from the subway. However, in Hong Kong, if 5 people take a taxi, it is very worthwhile (Hong Kong taxis can take 5 people). The surrounding area is also quite lively. Good choice. 
0	This is the worst hotel I have stayed in Hong Kong. The room is too small to imagine. The TV is 14 inches and the distance between the bed and the TV is only 60 cm. The entire room including the bathroom does not exceed 8 square meters. Fainted! 
1	Have chosen to stay at this hotel many times, and overall it is good. This time it might be because the hotel had a meeting and the room was a bit tight. Later it was upgraded to a double bed (water bed) room. Hotel breakfast is nothing new and similar to the previous few times. 
1	I read the online reviews extensively, and finally chose this hotel. The business sea view standard room on the 3rd floor is indeed first-class, but the sound insulation effect is a little bit worse. I was planning to choose the sea and sky. , The room is looking at the sea sideways. I heard that the front desk was a guest of the Association, and it was a bit cold. The big-eyed lobby manager is really good! 
0	No system, no driver CD, no full driver download from the official website, and some hardware (graphics and sound cards) are customized models, and the public version of the driver cannot be installed. The installation is particularly troublesome and requires a certain computer foundation. 
0	I saw Teacher Yu’s lecture on TV and I thought it was good. I bought this book. But I want to say that this book has no collection value. Can I watch TV or watch TV? 
0	Is there such a book in Dangdang???? Why should I leave the money and not distribute the book????? This is really disappointing!!!!!! 
0	Although the price of the hotel is not high, the service is really bad. The fruits and newspapers that are routinely delivered in the room are delivered only after calling to ask. The end of breakfast is advanced to 9 o'clock without any notice. The most annoying thing is my complaint When there is no breakfast, the front desk still refuses to admit the mistake and lied to me that the breakfast ended just before I went downstairs. It was myself that I went down late. I have never stayed in a four-star hotel with this kind of service. 
1	From love to worry, from love to fear; from love without worry, where is fear? So don't love, love parting is suffering. If there is no love and hatred, there is no bondage. 
1	I took my family to stay once, and the impression is very good. It is a good place for vacation. Dinner is a good deal for buying three and one free from Monday to Friday. I am going to live again in August. 
1	After reading the books I bought, I was a little disappointed. I originally bought books based on cultivating children's reading habits. After I got the books, I found that most of the books were pictures with too little text. What is gratifying is that the 5-year-old child likes it very much, especially the magical tadpole, who laughed so much that he leaned forward and closed together, and clamored to read the next book. Personal advice, if it is for the purpose of cultivating reading habits, I do not recommend buying this book. If it is based on the purpose of letting children open up their minds and like books, it is recommended to buy this book. It is more suitable for children in kindergarten to read. 
1	The location of the hotel is very convenient, the small suite rooms are more spacious and comfortable, and the hotel charges 40 yuan for parking overnight. 
1	The location is very close to our unit. From the price point of view, the price is very good. I want a double bed room, 168 yuan, the front desk staff is very good, the room hardware is average, but think about the price is that. It is clean, that is The mattress is too hard. BTW: There is no harassment of the phone, this is a good supplementary review March 4, 2008: By the way, free Internet access here, just work overtime online, very good 
1	Cheap and enough. I used a voucher for 100 cashback activities, and the price is very satisfactory. If the machine is broken, JD can pick up the item and change it without me running errands. 
1	Parents are not parents, but should be children's friends, feel their children's feelings with their heart, and love and respect children as equals. This is the biggest emotion I have after reading this book. Too many people around me, including myself, will consciously or unconsciously regard themselves as parents. It seems to be a Chinese tradition to train children. I am willing to talk to us. After reading this book, I began to reflect. I bought another book for my sister. If her family can improve the way of communication, her baby boy will have a happier childhood. 
1	"First of all, the price of the book is very common, and the simple decoration makes the arm not sore even if it is held in bed. Compared with the ""pseudo-books"" currently flooding the market for psychology research, the author's profound professional knowledge and the rigorous academic approach of the Germans make this book worth reading for both the general public and the readers with certain professional knowledge. For example, my friend thinks that reading this book has reference significance for how to educate children in the future. The four personality characteristics are explained in the context of performance, causes, characteristics, and cases. They have clear thinking, strong logic, and easy to understand, which is great! "
0	A book that feels bragging.. I just don’t think it’s worth the money. I’d rather buy some health magazines to be sincere. 
1	After experiencing the treatment of Tangkou Hotel and Xihai Hotel, Guomai is undoubtedly a surprise. The rooms are spacious and clean, at least they can guarantee a good night's sleep. In other cities, Guomai may not be enough for four-star, but if Xihai Hotel and others can be counted as four-star, Guomai is really cost-effective. The location is good and the price is cheap. It is the most satisfactory hotel on this trip to Huangshan. 
1	It is purely a story of a Northeastern. From the very beginning, she laughed to death. Yue Sheng's abnormal family background grew up a strange and irritable girl. As a result, she met Liu Ling who had the same temper. She was really a pair of children. , The dialogue is rough, but it's very crunchy. Although I have stayed in the Northeast for 20 years, I have never been in contact with that kind of people. Besides, I have been away for so long, so I feel very funny and very friendly. That is a straightforward world. First, the classmates said it was good, and then I read half of it online. I haven't read a book that is purely Northeastern, so I just bought it and read it slowly. 
1	The exterior color is navy blue, which is better than the black one in the photo I originally saw. Jingdong service is good, and the delivery is relatively timely. The system is being installed and has not been used yet 
0	It was very late when I went there, and a waiter got up from behind the front desk after several calls in the lobby to help check in. After entering the room, I found that the facilities in the room were very rudimentary, and the musty smell was also very strong. I only got up the next morning and took a closer look at the room. It was far worse than the Home Inn and other fast hotels. It was said to be a Samsung hotel, but it was not close to Samsung. . . I'm so sorry for the price of 220, it's worth a little over 100 at most. 
1	"The silent music in the movie and the refreshing scenes show the beauty of love. And the last boat that departed, accompanied by a child’s singing of ""Dream Pontoon"", grew Jane's endless love and stayed in the ancient, simple and pleasing green mountains and green waters at the time of death, only to bury love Only under the endless green mountains and clear waters can we have a long history and pass on from generation to generation. . . . . . Although the endings in the book and the movie are different, as long as you are in love with ""The Veil"" and curious about the mystery under the veil that is as thin as mist and slippery like flowing water, both can give you a satisfactory answer. . . . . "
0	The power chuck, but LENOVO has been replaced! The upper and lower shells fit a little bit, and the left support is a bit loose! It is not very convenient to change the memory, and almost tore off the connection line of the touchpad when it was removed! I don't know why it can't be mechanically fixed with screws, so I have to use a double-sided adhesive! The mold can only be said to be average! 
0	There is great hype and advertising suspicion! It can be said clearly in one sentence, the author should use one chapter to elaborate. The whole book has one meaning: fairness should be considered when doing things. Recommend not to buy! 
1	Watching them fight bloody battles, watching them blaze the road to happiness for us in that era, and fight for the dignity of the country for us. They still want to win in a war that they know is mortal. Is it cannon fodder? Not! They are bullets, they are the sharpest blades that hit the enemy's heart~! They taught me that at any time, even if it is dilapidated, even in embarrassment, even if there is no flame of hope, I must live optimistically, with lofty beliefs and firm faith, and I will live wonderfully! Live out dignity, live out value, live out the true self! Worth collecting~~ 
0	The piano paint is a fingerprint collector. I still like the previous matte surface. The computer does not have a system disk. It took a long time to repartition, and it feels that the machine is not very strong. 
1	"Mill's ""On Freedom"" has an irreplaceable position in the history of world thought. If you want to learn about freedom, you can't skip this book! However, if you want to understand the essence of classic academic works translated like this, patience is essential! This is because there are many places in such classic works that require readers to think constantly in order to slowly appreciate the spirit of the author. In addition, this is translated from English, it is inevitable that there are some problems or inappropriate and obscure aspects in translation, so readers need to slowly figure out! So if you want to read such a book, patience is essential! "
0	Warmly tell everyone, don’t stay here anymore. Turn off the air conditioner at 11 o’clock in the evening. There will be a signal for a while after the Internet. Breakfast is average, and the price is not low. It is the worst hotel I have ever booked. 
0	The price/performance ratio is too low, and its facilities, environment and location are really not worth more than 200. According to local friends, this class of hotel can be used for more than 100 yuan. I hope that Ctrip can provide value-for-money hotels in the future. 
0	The battery is a bit thick; the package comes with an inner bag, but the web page description is not written, so I almost bought one more; the update speed of JD.com's web page is too slow, and the order is taken and it has been used for almost a week. , The order information still shows waiting for pickup. . . . . . 
1	The screen is good, I installed XP very smoothly, I don’t know how others installed it; the number keys are soft, mainly because of the battery, but it takes a while to know whether it is good or not. 
1	1. The sound effect is good; 2. Although the camera is 300,000, it is still quite clear and not bad; 3. The computer has many shortcuts and is easy to use; 4. The configuration is worth the price (but I bought it and dropped it by 100 yuan , 555) 
1	Very cost-effective, that is, there is no recovery disk, and users need to back up themselves. It seems that Thinkpad no longer provides recovery disks. 
1	1. The 45nm processor and DDR3 memory reduce the power consumption to a certain extent, so the heat dissipation performance is acceptable, but not excellent; 2. The installation is simple, after entering the BIOS to change the hard disk settings, directly install XP SP3 to the end; 
1	The price is good, the location is not particularly easy to find, but the information provided by the front desk of the hotel is very accurate, and I can find it quickly by driving. The single room can only live for one person, but the conditions are good. It is recommended that one person can stay on business. 
0	The appearance is pretty decent, there is a strong musty smell when I get out of the elevator; the waiter enters my room without knocking on the door or ringing the doorbell when I am in the room, scared out of a cold sweat; I can't swipe my card at the checkout, because my credit card has no password , Actually brushed twice in a row, brushing twice the room rate; there is no hot water at 12 o'clock, and the air conditioner can only reach 15 degrees at the beginning of the first month; such a hotel should have been downgraded long ago! 
0	It is estimated that it is the difference between Chinese and foreign cultures. Anyway, I don't feel anything particularly good, and the animal shape is not cute, which is far from the Camilla series! Let's consider it carefully. 
1	"This should be my son’s favorite set of books. Since I bought it, I have to read it almost every night. It’s not annoying to read a story several times. Seeing that my son likes this set of books so much, I show this set of books to my son’s class. Recommended by my parents, recommended by my classmates, and my friend’s daughter. These children especially like ""Fantastic School Bus"". My friend’s daughter said: ""I want to go to that school too!"" The knowledge points contained in this book Especially many, but children are very easy to accept! One more thing, Dangdang's delivery speed is very fast, this is my most satisfying point! "
0	I don't know why such a high evaluation came from, is it Dangdang's ranking? The good books I scoured have never been in the rankings, only this one was affected by the rankings, which is not interesting at all. 
1	The interface is rich, the workmanship is more exquisite, the piano-painted keyboard is very distinctive, the touchpad feels first-class, but the two buttons are relatively hard, and the heat dissipation performance is very good! The speaker sound quality is also good! 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
1	Personally, I think it is very suitable for children from 4 to 6 years old. For children of this age, too complicated and professional knowledge may not be absorbed. The text content in the book is very moderate, and the pictures are beautiful, which is quite good. When the books arrived, the child was irritating and said that he would throw them away. I picked up a copy and opened it. The little guy glanced at his eyes, and the little head immediately came over, and soon became immersed in the book. He had forgotten that he was angry and wanted to throw the book away. Ha ha! By the way, the price of this set of books is not cheap, and this is the only place that makes parents feel worried. 
1	"In a simple and smooth style, I wrote the memories of a child, watching and slowly experiencing the joy and love. It is not only read by educators, but also a good literary book. It is worthy of being an article selected as a textbook, and even children can read it. Just like life itself, it is simple and popular, but ""love"" is revealed nowhere. At the end, I was very moved and had to respect Teacher Xiaolin. I think such an elementary school may be the dream of every child. If the current elementary school is like this, then there may be no children who are tired of studying. "
1	8600, high score, bluetooth, camera, fingerprint, esata, hdmi, 1394, there are all that should be, and there are some that shouldn’t be, only 5999, oh. 
1	The manual is very detailed, the recovery system, hidden partition, etc. are very clear, and the appearance is beautiful. After more than a week, no problems were found. It is worth buying 
1	This is a good book that inspires children's imagination. Little caterpillars leave a vivid “hole” in what they eat every day, which is full of infinite novelty and imagination for children. I think this book is very suitable for children around two years old to read. My baby is less than two years old. I didn’t feel it at the beginning because I didn’t respond to the abstract painting with Van Gogh characteristics in front of the book. , It may be that the picture books I read before are all too modest and not suitable for foreign painters' works with strong sense of color. But I have seen its great charm. Highly recommended. 
0	It’s still a bit hot. The carton has been opened. It’s a little depressed, but the HD hard drive is powered on for 3 hours. Fortunately, the logistics is terrible, and the service of Shentong is bad. There are still a few drivers that have not been settled 
0	I have studied Chinese medicine for five years. The original intention of the patient may be good, but many prescriptions are wrong in the content, such as Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. Why are so many people watching? 
0	After buying this set of books, my daughter likes it very much, and I like it personally. I often read with my children. The exquisite pictures and vivid language make children have a great interest in reading. I recommend everyone to buy this set of books for their children. . 
0	The only biggest shortcoming: the battery is really bad, just two hours, hey. . . Also, the heat dissipation of the machine is a little bit worse, but it doesn't get in the way and is not very serious. 
1	After a week, the installed vista runs smoothly, not bad. The CPU is a bright spot of this machine. 
0	The surrounding environment of the hotel is acceptable, about 5 kilometers away from the train station, which is far away, the air in the room is not good, and it is older. Not recommended. 
1	Nice hotel, service is ok, will stay next time~ 
0	I bought a 31-year-old little beautiful woman's Beauty Sutra. When I read it, I found that there are dozens of traces drawn with a pen in the second half of the book, which makes people look uncomfortable. How can I solve it? 
1	Free upgrade to executive room, stay here every time you go. The equipment and space are first-class in Hong Kong 
0	It feels average, that is, it’s average in all aspects. It’s okay to live in places like Sanmenxia 
0	This hotel is so bad, I saw cockroaches as soon as I entered the room. The facilities are also poor, I don't know when the TV is? Press the keys on the bedside, who knows that it will be sunken as soon as you press it. The walls on the walkway are already It's damp, even the front desk set is in tatters, it's time to renovate. 
0	There are two dissatisfaction with this booking 1. I arrived at the hotel at 2 am on the 21st due to flight reasons, but the hotel still charges 20 days room rate. 2. The hotel room layout is extremely poor. When booking online, you cannot know the room type. It is recommended to increase. 3. Outdated room facilities. The most hateful thing is that there are cockroaches in the room. When talking to the service staff, I told you that: it is already a discounted price. 
0	The rest of the book is very good. The binding is wrong! Fortunately, this book was printed by the printing house of Jiaotong University, so I went to change it again. I hope that the manufacturer will pay attention when shipping to others in the future! 
0	It's a bit heavy and lacks the corresponding wireless network card driver in the random driver disk. If you want to download it online, the driver is provided in a mess, and it is a little troublesome to install the system. 
1	"I’ve been famous for ""Muslim’s Funeral"" for a long time, but I have never had the opportunity to read it. Maybe it’s because I have too many mundane affairs to be busy with... This time I bought this book for the girl I like I have also admired this book for a long time. I thought to help her find a copy, but I sigh that the pirated book was not only a typo, but also had dozens of pages missing. Then I simply bought this on Dangdang. The price is also super cheap. She and I are very happy. I will definitely read this book if I take the time, like ""Muslim's Funeral"" and Dingdang.com! "
1	The designated business double room, the room is too small, but the economy hotel is like this; the environment is average, the surrounding feels quite chaotic, but there is an Yichu Lotus Supermarket next to it, which is very convenient for shopping; the service is relative to the other 2 economical hotels The best hotel 
1	"My favorite of the six books is ""I Can Beat the Monsters"". I have been 3 years and 11 months old. I downloaded ""A Different Carmela"" MP3 from the Internet. I listened to her several times. This morning I heard her muttering to herself by herself. I listened carefully, ""Famine, there is a famine in the chicken coop..."", God~she can almost write the entire book After repeating it, she still didn’t know a word~ I explained that I would change another one every day, ""I Want to Watch the Sea"" is also good, but people are not happy~ I don’t understand why I like this book so much, yes, My family is a girl, very stinky girl~ "
1	The location of the hotel is better, the facilities are relatively new, the rooms are relatively spacious, and the service is fair. 
1	It's been 2 days since I came back and I was very busy. I didn't have time to comment. Today I have to chat about the feelings of staying at the Seaview Hotel. I stayed at the sea view from 7.25 to 7.30, because my family was on vacation and the child was relatively young (5 years old), so when I decided to go to Qingdao for a vacation, I checked the situation of Qingdao hotel on the Internet. It turned out to be the Zhanqiao Prince Hotel. I was surprised to see everyone’s evaluation of the sea view. It can be said that there is no negative evaluation. Everyone agreed that this hotel is excellent, so I canceled the sea view and changed the sea view to see what the sea view depends on to get everyone’s unanimous praise. ! Now I’ll start with the first phone call from the sea view: I booked a flight at 6:00 pm on 7.25, and arrived in Qingdao at about 7:00. When I booked the hotel, I wrote in the remarks that the hotel needs to be picked up. I received it on the 23rd. On the phone of the hotel, a sweet girl contacted me for the specific pick-up time and left me with the phone number of the pick-up staff. I felt very comfortable. After getting off the plane on the 25th, I saw someone holding a person with my name written on it. The sign stood at the exit of the terminal waiting for us. A handsome young man greeted me very politely and took the luggage in my hand very naturally. After getting on the hotel shuttle bus, the driver immediately handed over a cool towel and Mineral water, really thoughtful! Admiring the night view of Qingdao all the way, I drove for about 40 minutes to arrive at the hotel. Before the car stopped, I saw a young man in a suit waiting at the entrance of the lobby. Later I learned that this young man was specially for us. After getting off the bus Immediately there was a bellman who put our luggage on the cart. I prepared to register in the lobby according to the usual practice. As a result, the young man led us directly to the room. All the registration work was done by him. I really felt very comfortable. A very good impression. The room is very comfortable. I booked the executive room 2712. The facilities are very complete. The soothing background music is playing in the room. It can be seen that the hotel is very attentive. Soon the waiter delivered orange juice and towels, and gave them away. A pair of small dolls, the child liked it very much, and later found out that the dolls, fruits and snacks were given out every day, but the baby was very happy. When he went home, the dolls were packed in a pocket. There is nothing to say about the service. The room service is very timely and attentive. When eating in the restaurant, the waiter specially brought the baby special cute cartoon tableware for children. One day the baby had a fever. The hotel soon sent a doctor up to open it. After taking the medicine, for dinner, considering that I was afraid that the baby could not stand the air conditioner, I ordered a meal delivery service. After the dinner was delivered, I found that the hotel had added a large bowl of white fungus porridge, a large plate of french fries and a bowl of ginger soup. The illness was half healed immediately, and the waiter saw us greeting the baby's condition the next day, which made people feel very warm. One day at dinner, I had a slight cough due to smoking too much. Soon the waiter brought me a bowl of white fungus porridge and told me that the cough could be relieved. Also, when I had breakfast on the last day, the baby went to the beach with my mother the evening before. When looking for a small crab, a small bag was bitten on the leg by a mosquito. We didn't care about it, but the waiter took the initiative to send disinfected iodine compresses and wind oil essence to the baby after seeing the baby scratching itching. Ashamed. The five-day holiday is coming to an end soon, I asked the baby, is it OK to go home? The baby said: I don't want to go home, but I want to stay in a hotel. Children speak without restraint, children speak without deception! I was very touched during the five days with the sea view. The employees of the sea view truly reflect the corporate culture of the sea view. If the hardware of the sea view is 5 stars, then the service of the sea view is definitely 7 stars. The sea view is the pride of Qingdao and also the pride of China! 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the keyboard is very cute, 16:9 screen is very cool to watch movies, the new machine is still relatively quiet, it is still very good to buy such a machine at this price. The battery life is good. 
1	The service is good, but the room, especially the toilet in the north facing room, is offensive, it is recommended to improve 
1	1. It is very light and has a small power supply. It is usually carried in a big bag and carried around. This time the load is reduced. It is cool. The 12.1 inch Dell used originally, which is much heavier than Xiaohei 2. Low noise, basically no sound when running. 3. Good heat dissipation, and the temperature is not high for continuous long-term use 
0	I booked this hotel for my friend through Ctrip. When my friend checked in, there were many vacancies in the hotel. But my friend was actually placed in a room where the air conditioner was leaking and the walls were damp and moldy for a long time. Too shameful. After negotiating with the hotel staff, he changed another room. Better than the first room. 
1	A person who can understand the Scriptures is like drinking milk. People who can calm their body and mind are like eating cheese. People who can correspond to the teachings of the law are like tasting crisps. People who have Mahayana wisdom are like tasting cooked crisps. A person who always adheres to all disciplines seems to have the taste of Daigo. The mellowness of milk and the sweetness of cheese make it flow when thinking of two delicious things. . . . . It turns out that some of Buddhism is also derived from real life. Cultivating one's mind and nature is not bad. It can kill two birds with one stone. 
1	I have read this book several times. Although the author’s sentences are not as good as others, writing about childhood is a very precious record. Therefore, no matter what you write about childhood, as long as you can read it, it is A very exquisite article, you will never tire of reading it! I am now ready to be a youth, and I plan to write my childhood fun as vividly as the author! 
0	The service is too bad, there are too many mosquitoes in the room at night, and the human care is not good 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, the system interface inside is also very beautiful, even the packaging box is very beautiful, so that girls love it, hehe, really powerful 
1	I went after reading comments from netizens, it was really good. The environment is good, close to the sea, the hotel swimming pool is also good, and the service is better, much like the service in Hainan, Thailand and other places, all are smiling services, the accommodation does not require a deposit, and the CHECK IN/OUT is very fast; it is the welcoming guest The house on the first floor does not have a lobby; in addition, there seems to be a problem with the design of the shower room. . . 
0	I was really disappointed. I hoped to increase my vocabulary, but the words are too small and the content is too messy after opening it. It is not suitable for my beginner level. Is there a zero-based introductory book? If you can change to another book! 
1	The overall feeling of the room is ok except that the decoration is not trendy enough. I live in a double bed room. It would be better if the bathroom in the room could be made of glass. The location of the hotel is excellent. We took a bus from Guangzhou to Chang'an. After we got off the bus, we passed the road to Chang'an Hotel, which was super convenient. There are restaurants and Baijia supermarkets around the hotel. I especially recommend everyone to try Minghongchuan cuisine. When I was living in Chang'an eleven years ago, there was a Minghongchuan restaurant, and it was still there after 11 years! And the taste is still so good, and the dishes are much more refined than before, haha... What Ctrip needs to improve is to negotiate with the hotel. Every room should be given a double breakfast. One breakfast causes a lot of inconvenience to guests. . To be honest, the two of them stayed in the hotel. If they didn’t eat breakfast, they felt wasted. Let’s eat. Another breakfast cost more than 50 yuan. It is not that the price is expensive, but the quality of the breakfast is not worth the money, ha ha... … 
1	The price is good, the machine is good in workmanship, you can buy Xiao Hei at this price, it is too worth it, and other brands are not considered 
1	I paid for the purchase at 5 o'clock in the afternoon last weekend. The price at that time was still 4,699. By the end of the night, it had become 4,999. It should be Jingdong’s weekend activities, which saved me 300 yuan. 
1	Every time I go to Jiangmen I live in this hotel, the traffic is more convenient, the room is a bit old 
1	The location is excellent, and the attitude of the waiters is quite good. Recommended. 
1	It turns out that learning is a very happy thing. I bought this set of books at that time to let my son understand that learning is not cumbersome, not forced by parents and teachers, and learning can be very happy and happy. The process of learning is to play and enjoy the happy time of interacting with parents and teachers. Fortunately, my son is very happy to learn. Of course, I told him that this is learning after a few days of learning. My son said to me happily, Mom, learning is so fun, and I like learning. Yes, no wonder educators tell us that the most important thing for children is guidance. 
0	I bought it for my sister because I’m not together. I don’t know which chipset it is. It would be GM45. . 
1	The room is relatively clean, but the windows cannot be opened and the air is not so good. The breakfast is good. Overall good. 
1	The service is very good, especially the customer manager of the hotel. The service is especially good and considers the guests very well. It is not very good to name and praise here. The rooms are also good. I will stay here next time. 
0	This is a book I have read with terrible writing. I have bought it and I have finished reading it patiently, but overall it is not good. The text, content and structure are not good. 
1	Finally, I came up with the idea of buying physical books from my buddies. Of course, the first choice was the four walls. The result was out of stock, so I had to go back and buy the betrayal and affair. I haven't seen the affair yet, and dare not talk nonsense. 
0	This book vividly reflects the various rules of the workplace in the way of writing a character. No wonder he is one of the most popular books right now. It's worth seeing. 
1	The hotel is well located in the center of Quanzhou. The hotel hardware is OK, relatively new, and the service attitude of the staff is also good. But the only bad thing is that the breakfast has too few varieties and the quality is average. 
0	Some male chauvinists seem to feel very uncomfortable in their hearts. People should be independent. In order to maintain a marriage relationship, and always live a life centered on each other, sooner or later, they will lose themselves. 
1	But the book scolded the Chinese girl for her bad attitude. They should show care for their fellow sisters rather than scolding. 
1	This is the hotel where I live in Taiyuan with a good price/performance ratio, but the waiter asked for a quilt alone last time I checked in. The smell is extremely bad, it is not commensurate with the hotel, and there is no breakfast.It is recommended that Ctrip consider coordinating with the hotel. 
0	The content is too simple, repeating too many times that my son is one year old and five months old, obviously not interested in this. I prefer the Tom series. 
1	A good choice to go to Liuzhou. The surrounding area is quite lively, bookstores, pedestrian streets...the service is good, and the rooms are ok. The bathroom is too small, and the breakfast is too average. Anyway, going to Liuzhou is considered OK. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: We have given feedback to the western restaurant about your opinion, and the buffet breakfast variety has been adjusted. I believe it will satisfy you. Liuzhou Hotel is located in the commercial center of Liuzhou. It is very convenient to eat, live, travel, travel, shop and entertain. It is your first choice for business and tourism in Liuzhou! ! 
0	In fact, the style is not very satisfying and not good-looking. In addition, I have not noticed that this notebook is not a full keyboard. Graphics card performance is not as good as expected. The keyboard does not seem to be flat. When I press it down, I feel that the entire keyboard board is moving. The workmanship is also not very sophisticated, there are gaps in many places, and the workmanship is indeed worse than my HP. 
0	The screen garbage is dying! Too bright and piercing! Great damage to eyes! ! ! Eyes hurt after a long time! I don’t know how everyone’s books are! Anyway, color is the most trash among the more than 10 notebooks I purchased! Adjusting the graphics card settings is useless! Great color deviation! If used to work! Certainly not! 
1	1. The machine is small, the weight is equivalent to a textbook, and it is convenient to use; 2. XP is installed automatically when booting, without any hardware driver; 3. The battery life is more than 5 hours, and the Internet speed is very fast, which may be related to Network related; 4. Comes with a white inner bag, leather quality, it can be used if the requirements are not high; 5. Comes with a recovery CD; 6. The machine is not hot at all after 7 hours of continuous booting 
1	This time, I found that I have worked hard on the service. For example, in the aisle, there are newspapers in the bathroom. The restaurant breakfast buffet service, and the elevator service are all attentive. In fact, the hotel service hardware does not have to be luxurious, but you must treat the guests sincerely. I hope to persist. 
1	Even though I saw it in a hurry, I still had an impression. My friends said it was valuable after seeing it. I also bought a hand-to-handle especially to deal with the distracted children. Buying a kitchen timer is really useful. Children can at least realize that there is a passive time concept in doing things. If one day they have an active time concept and the wisdom to choose time (difficult, many adults can't do it well!) ), then get rid of the procrastination completely. Parents who are similarly confused, can be inspired. 
0	The screen is bigger, the battery can only be used for 6 hours, not as exaggerated as the legend, the charging time is too long, the machine is too heavy, the bottom is very hot when used up, 170G is divided into two zones, and the speed can only meet general needs . 
0	I bought this book because I read the overwhelming five-star reviews on the Internet. When I received it, I was disappointed. At best, it was a kind of workplace diary that was fine in the workplace. Critics said that it introduced several human resource methods and work skills. I really want to suggest to those critics, you should study~ 
0	The classmate recommended it and said it was very good. Maybe the expectations were too high. After reading it, I was very disappointed. Things written by foreigners don't seem to make much sense in China. 
1	I admire Su Dongpo and like Lin Yutang, so I bought this book without hesitation. This book is different from other types of biographies. It is plainly narrated and interspersed with a lot of leisure and anecdotes. It is a delight to read from beginning to end. Lin Yutang, who wanted to come up with a brilliant brush, singled out Su Dongpo's biography, perhaps because of the similar optimistic and knowledgeable spirit of the two. Dongpo is proficient in all kinds of poetry, calligraphy, and painting. Mr. Yutang's language strategy is strategizing, and his prose and novels are all fine works. Although he has been traveling for many years, he enjoys it. To observe two people in one book, the quality of the person is better than the view of the text. 
0	A very ordinary hotel, it should not be worth the price. Old hotel, small rooms, poor breakfast. Roads are being built around, making a mess. It is difficult to find a better restaurant! After eating a meal in the hotel, there was no formal menu, which was strange! But the service is good, this is the only place worthy of praise! 
0	To be honest, this is the worst book I bought in Dangdang. I thought it was a theoretical one. I didn’t expect the author to talk endlessly about his grievances with a few people. It feels like Lu Xun’s sister-in-law Xianglin. It's boring. The author also said that he is the big boss. I think he has to make a big question. The big boss needs to hype the book like this? Need to work hard to get these manuscript fees? ! 
0	I don't know if the book is not good, or it gives too much hope. From the beginning to the end, there are two feelings: 1. The quality of the paper is really very, very, very good, so that it is habitual to turn back one page to determine if it is turned over. 2. This is a book that brainwashes readers. If you don't want to be brainwashed before reading and do not have your own firm values, then after reading this book, it will become a little thing that changes your life. But fortunately, it’s a translation. There is no special tightness between the words, leaving people breathing space. 
0	I thought that the book that used to be the number one in the ranking must be good. As a result, after I got the book, I was very disappointed. Wrong. This book caters to the hearts of the public. However, the author's irresponsible attitude is so disappointing! I do not recommend that you buy this book!! Very disappointed! It was a waste of 20 yuan! 
1	The environment is good. Check in on August 18th, and the elevator was installed on August 16th. The reservation staff did not understand this information. The best hotel for travel in these few months, the price is high. 
1	Not bad, the first choice for Beijing. The restaurant is too expensive. . . . . . 
1	Absolute imperial medicine, this is a rare medical book, worthy of our people to read carefully, because the content of this book is a real example, absolutely true. If your relatives are also suffering from similar diseases, please practice seriously. That will help your loved ones the most. Those who still slander and attack teacher Liu Hongzhang’s imperial medicine have ulterior motives. I sincerely hope that our Chinese people can truly live a happy life, but this requires careful reading of imperial medicine. 
0	The memory is too small! Have to add it yourself! The speed of the pre-installed VISTA system is a bit slow! When reading the CD, the sound is very loud! It would be nice to send a package! 
1	"The author really has the rigorous style of the British, presenting opinions and making arguments. Although I do not have a deep understanding of physics, I can still feel the spark of truth. The structure of the whole book is quite distinctive. It is introduced from the popular computer topics at the time (written in the 1980s), and then used mathematics, physics, and cosmology as necessary foreshadowing-these contents occupy most of the space. To the key question: Can computers replace the human brain? Contrary to popular views, the author believes that certain ""insights"" of humans cannot be simulated by algorithms. Perhaps the author wants to say that the human soul is irreplaceable. "
1	The screen is perfect, but the color is slightly worse. The price is cheap, the machine speed is okay, and the delivery speed is fast. 
1	Ctrip was good this time. The executive room I booked gave me a free upgrade to the mountain view room in Building 8. For the hotel, let’s summarize: Super 5-star environment, 4-star rooms, 3-star facilities and services. The hotel is built on the mountain, and there is a special walking route map in the hotel. The mountain view of the entire hotel should be taken at least 1 Hours, during the landscape and bridge road, birds call and insects, the air is fresh and refreshing! Building 8 is the best building in the hotel (the price is the most expensive). When you enter the room, the room is large, and there is a green mountain view outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. But the big bed is not very comfortable at first glance, the bed is very low, the quality of the mattress is not good, the bedding is clean but the color is obviously old and the color is gray, and it feels hard. The furniture, electrical appliances and bathroom supplies are all Very general. 68. Breakfast for one person is quite rich. It’s okay to have a full meal. Exquisite and delicious are not even mentioned. The attitude of the waiters everywhere is still very good, but the sense of service and the quality of service should be improved. The hotel has a spacious parking lot, but both guests are charged. Hotel feedback July 10, 2008: Hello! Thank you for your valuable comments on Hongzhushan Hotel, our hotel has now replaced all the linen, your comments have been handed over to the relevant departments for processing, we sincerely look forward to Your next visit! 
1	It's good in all aspects, and the speed and appearance are acceptable. I added 2G Samsung memory, and the original 1G is also Samsung. . 
0	"Before school started, I bought a set for my niece (I'm five years old, I can read some books), and now it’s winter vacation, I asked her if the book is good, and she said: ""There are too few words to read, not good "". Seeing her dismissive look, I know that I should not blindly believe the online sales rankings. "
0	It is said that it is 4 stars, but there is no non-smoking room, which is really speechless. Hotel Feedback April 28, 2008: Dear guests, thank you very much for staying at Seven Star Business Hotel! The 10th floor of this hotel is a non-smoking floor guest room, and the floors and guest rooms have obvious non-smoking floor signs. We sincerely look forward to your next visit to our hotel, we will try our best to meet your reservation needs. 
0	The black edges of the screen are too wide. The v version of windows is totally unrecognizable and extremely unaccustomed. No other problems have been found so far. The battery life is 3 hours and 9 minutes, which is less than the description. 
0	It's not as good as I expected. Maybe this book is more suitable for children under 2 years old. An oversized, overweight, and hardcover book. There is no substance, just a few pages, which is quite expensive. Such a book is not worth reading again, just make a simple package and sell it at a cheap price. 
0	I thought it was very popular online, but in fact the content was very general and the writing was not good. I communicated with several colleagues, and everyone felt that they didn't understand what I was writing. . . . . 
0	After reading Dangdang’s recommendations and online reviews, I made up my mind to buy it. After reading it, I found that it was not as interesting as I imagined. Sometimes I felt naive. I don’t know if I really don’t satisfy me or I don’t understand Korean style. Humor! 
1	The configuration is relatively high, there is no noise, the operation is very quiet, the heat dissipation is good, the DVD is burned, and the additional 1G memory is installed, the speed is very good 
0	The packaging is exquisite, the content is flashy, and the Korean humor is really not good! It doesn't sound good, it's just shit! 
1	After seeing the section on children with ADHD, I felt really crazy. I seem to have seen a certain poem by Yin Jianli. I wonder if I remembered it wrong? So I bought this book after reading the introduction. It's really good, recommend it to mothers. 
1	The breakfast is very good. The room condition is good, but the TV is too small. Very convenient around. Check out at 8:30 and waited more than ten minutes. 
0	"The son is over 2 years old, and this book is a bit difficult for him. I think it is more suitable for children aged 4-5. In general, the picture is a bit ""chaotic"", even adults seem to be struggling. This book is more like a map. For example, the book will introduce a variety of cars with complete names and styles, but the story is not strong and it is a bit boring to read. "
0	4 stars? The service is very poor, the room key requires considerable skill to open the door, and no one took the initiative to mention it, called the waiter to open, and left after opening. Go out again, call someone to open, and ask the service staff before telling you how to do it. And breakfast is not as good as a 2-star hotel! Also, the front desk pre-approved the room rate, but couldn't get it out the next day. After twenty minutes, without my consent, the room rate was removed again, and the pre-approval continued to freeze, which was very bad! ! ! 
0	This book is boring. The whole book for the mentally handicapped. The delivery speed of Dangdang is too slow. I only received it in a month. The service attitude is extremely poor. I sent the email to the past and I never regret it. There seems to be no use for shopping coupons! 
1	I stayed in the luxurious sea-view big bed room No. 7-10. Before booking through Ctrip, I called the Blue Sky Hotel and told me that there was no room. I was still depressed. But with the idea of ​​giving it a try, I submitted an order on Ctrip, but I didn't expect to send me a text message to confirm it! At that time, I was very surprised, because I was taking the baby with me, so I was afraid of making mistakes. After arriving in Weihai, I called the main station to confirm and told me that the reservation was OK. This was relieved. It is indeed the most highly rated hotel by Ctrip netizens. The service is better, and the baby cot is prepared for us in advance, and the overall waiter is very polite and warm. The sea view has been damaged by the Qiming Holiday Hotel in front, but it is still good. You can see the sea from the bed. The breakfast is also good, very rich, with Chinese, Western, South Korean, and Japanese. I personally like western breakfast. Both cherry and chocolate cream pudding and egg tarts are good. The egg tarts are still iced. When LP drank the porridge, he whispered to me and forgot to take another spoon. The waiter brought it when he heard it. Take the initiative to prepare a baby chair for my baby. I want to eat breakfast as lunch, haha. If you go to Weihai for vacation in the future, you will still live here! A little suggestion: Evening paper can be delivered a day, that thing is nothing but a piece of cake. I have stayed in a hotel in Guangzhou and delivered the Yangcheng Evening News every day. You can also send two fruits a day. Generally, guests who come back for a day are happy to eat a peach or a small persimmon, and the cost is only one or two yuan, ha ha. Additional comment July 11, 2008: Forgot to mention, the drain valve of the bathtub seemed to be loose on the first day I lived there, and the water leaked relatively quickly, which caused most of the water in the tank to leak a lot, so I could only take a bath while draining it. Taking a bath, it makes noise and wastes water. When I went out the next morning, I told the waiter. I came back in the evening and found that it should have been handled. The service is more attentive. But later, there were still some small omissions, ha ha. Hotel feedback July 11, 2008: Dear guest, hello, thank you for your message! We will try our best to meet your needs. We welcome your valuable suggestions and hope to provide you with better services when you next stay. 
1	The speed of JD delivery is quite fast. The order placed the night before will arrive at noon the next day. 
0	The partition is indeed a bit deformed. Can Lenovo do a survey? Users want to prepare partitions in advance, of course it is not such a perverted partition 
1	Quite a good book! ! Unlike those recipes, this book is a very systematic explanation of Sichuan cuisine, one category by category, starting from the condiments, very detailed and practical, and not at all boring, it feels like a conversation with a chef, vivid And it has benefited a lot. There is not a picture in the whole book, but I still salivate. My mother made the tile fish for me once as mentioned above. Compared with the previous ones, the craftsmanship is like two people made it. The taste is not good. Highly recommended! ! Very worthy of collection. 
1	The room in this hotel is a bit old. It is estimated that it has been open for several years. The door of the room can only be opened by two people inside and outside. The surrounding environment is not very good. It is recommended to live in a room by the sea in the future. The service attitude is OK, The food is really not good. Don't live there anymore to save money 
1	The machine is small and light, and it feels very skinny. It’s so cool that you can feel the lightness when you travel frequently. The feeling of using wireless Internet is really great. You can use the free Internet at home. The signal is not bad. I am considering whether to cancel broadband. 
1	The room environment at this price is very good and it feels very clean^_^ I personally feel very elegant in Xingwang Building... Next time I come, I will definitely book it here. . . 
1	The workmanship is quite good and the hand feels outstanding. It is very convenient to install XP with an external optical drive, just buy a one-click GOST. 
0	The facilities are outdated, the traffic between the various areas of the hotel is chaotic, the breakfast variety is low, and the quality is poor. The advantage is the convenient transportation around. 
1	"Kazuo Inamori believes that his success is not his personal success, but that the Creator gave him this opportunity to open up the wisdom of the mind because of goodness, and obtain the power of the universe because of goodness. Imagine that we often regard our immediate success as our own ability, and we are complacent, arrogant, and ignore or deny other powers. Using external success to prove yourself is actually a lack of inner strength, which just shows a lack of self-confidence. Humility is even more necessary for success. Willing to let go of one's own desires can truly start from the perspective of ""altruism"". Kazuo Inamori uses his sincere practice to guide us to enlightenment! "
1	it is good! ! At that time, I saw some people commenting that there are many harassing calls, but I still have lingering fears. Is the result so good? Where are the calls? When we call ourselves, the front desk will check our identities carefully, and the rooms are also good and the service is very good. It is really the best hotel in Xuzhou! 
1	I don’t know computers, but my friends say that the personality is good! And the appearance is good, relatively light. The keyboard is relatively close to the desktop, and it is comfortable to use! It was delivered from Guangzhou to Guangxi on the fourth day, and it was very fast! 
0	"I saw the article ""Tears Are the Only Standard for Testing Literature"" on Southern Weekend. I have to admit that I was a petty bourgeoisie at the time and the author wrote sensational. Look at the topic. After I got the book, I flipped through it. The story is a common routine in novels, movies, and TV. The plot of life and death and blood doubts under the background of the Cultural Revolution is even simpler. The possible difference is that the tragic death is a male compatriot—— The third child. A series of celebrities who despise the recommendations on the back cover of this book. Fortunately, I then read a rather interesting workplace novel Du Lala's promotion note, which makes this life like life. "
0	I lived in a street-facing room on the 6th floor before National Day, which was very noisy. In the late evening, there were still large trucks driving around. In the morning, it was still the sound of the truck. Maybe a room not facing the street would be better. Also, the bathroom is so small that it can only allow one person to turn around. The hotel does not provide disposable soap, I only give it to them. Fortunately, it is free. The sanitary condition is average, so be it. 
1	The Vista system still doesn't work well. It is very troublesome to change to XP. It is recommended not to install it by yourself if you don't know much about the computer. I have studied for a long time before finally changing to XP. I feel very fulfilled. 
1	The hotel is cost-effective, and the transportation is very convenient.It is worth mentioning that the seafood street is not far across the hotel.It is very cheap and very affordable.Next time I go to Shenzhen, I will live in Guangshen. 
1	This book was recommended to me by a colleague who sold it to her daughter. As a result, my daughter couldn't put it down as soon as she got the book (daughter is 2 years and 7 months old), and asked me to draw like crayons in the story while telling it to her. When I come back from get off work every day, the first thing my daughter asks me to paint with her. My daughter learned to distinguish the colors of different things while listening to the painting, and she also remembered the names of colors very well. I also use the content of this book to guide my daughter to recognize the colors of other things, and she is also very interested. This book is worth buying! 
1	The price/performance ratio is indeed ok. Catch up with Shenzhou At the same price, the configuration of Shenzhou is not comparable to this. 16:9 screen is more cool to watch widescreen movies. 
1	"I once bought the same book in a bookstore. Just because it was practical and liked by children, I bought it as a gift to my friends. This series of books is very good, including the layout, graphics and supporting animation VCD, which are very suitable for children from 2 to 6 years old to learn and watch. Our baby started learning when he was less than two years old. In just two months, the 38 nursery rhymes can be basically recited. At the same time, she is also obsessed with the matching animation, friends who want to buy similar books, recommend this book, and the series of ""Reciting Tang Poems"" and ""English Songs"" are also very good! "
1	The room is clean and tidy, there is a computer to play games and surf the Internet :-) The air conditioner is a bit loud, and everything else is fine. All the charge items in the room have price tags on them, which is fair! My mobile phone charger plugs are of different standards. The room service has delivered the charger and the adapter, which is very efficient. The breakfast buffet is also good. Just near the old town of Suxi Road, the surrounding area is a bit messy. 
0	I checked in on January 15th, 2008. The room smelled of disinfectant and it was very cold. The air-conditioning was turned on. The quilt covering the two beds was still not warm. The other facilities were all shabby and I would never stay again! Even because this room almost didn't want to use Ctrip's reservation service. 
0	The VISTA system is not proficient in use; by comparison, the VISTA system is relatively fast to run with 2G of memory. 
1	It is said to be one of the most expensive hotels in Qingdao. The rooms are very warm, but the bathroom seems a bit old. Everything else is fine. 
0	As a quasi-four-star company, you can't use credit cards, so you should pay attention to bringing money. There is the famous Zongheng nightclub in Lhasa in the hotel park. Every night there is singing and the sound is very loud. It won’t stop until one or two o’clock, and the assistant manager in the lobby can’t do anything about it. Because it is not under the management of the hotel, it is second after staying overnight on August 21. Run away quickly. How dare to accept 520 in such a place? ! In fact, there are many cost-effective hotels in Lhasa, and it is recommended that Ctrip inspect more. 
1	The facilities in the room are not bad, but the shower head in the bathroom is not easy to use, the water volume is not adjustable, the water is scattered, and some are not like the four-star standard. The surrounding environment, especially the environment behind the hotel, is not so good, and the lobby is too small. 
0	I bought it only a day later. Another model with similar configuration, but the price of a higher model is much cheaper than this one after the price is reduced. Lost in buying! ! ! 
0	1. The price is expensive. You can almost buy two parallel imports of the same model, but the business is supposed to be guarantee and service. I recognized 2. The production date of the screen detected by the software is actually 2007.01 (the HT1 bought at the same time is 4 this year) Month), and the yellowish part of the screen is visible under the white background, speechless 
0	The quality of the book is good, but it feels that the layout is not very reasonable. After opening, it feels very messy and dense. Children don't like it. 
1	Live here every time! Especially the restaurant, let people linger :) 
1	This machine is very high in configuration and cost performance under the same brand and price. Especially the graphics card. There is also the original bag and mouse to send ~ very unexpected ~ 
1	The battery is durable, and it can take 3 hours and 15 minutes to watch the webpage and occasionally listen to music. The display effect is good, very white and translucent. I dare not test the display for two days. I'm afraid it's a Samsung screen. In the past, books were Samsung garbage screens. It made me lose my eyesight and hurt my health. Today I think it’s time to comment. Only to test, just use EVEREST test. It is actually LG Philips LP140WH1-TLA1 but there is a color point. In the lower middle, it is not very obvious. I always feel like a mole on Meimei’s face. But in my heart! I would rather have LG screens with colored dots than Samsung’s eye screen 
1	E5400 is of good quality. Friends who don’t install the system must pay attention to it. Linux is not easy to use. Try to buy one with windows. 
0	Did the consignor of JD.com have not rested for a few months and bought something for a friend? The delivery address is Zhucheng, Weifang. He actually sent it to me and wrote: Ocean University of China (Zhucheng). 
0	The service attitude is really terrible, especially the waiters on the floor, all of them are aunts, and their attitude is very bad! The bathroom is full of water for a bath, and the flow rate of the washbasin is really slow to test people's patience. This hotel as a whole is only compared Poor. The service and facilities are not worth the price. The train is noisy at night. Hotel feedback December 13, 2006: Thank you very much for your outspoken criticism. The hotel attaches great importance to your opinions and specifically addresses your suggestions Opinions held an on-site meeting and decided that the hotel will start a comprehensive service awareness training for all employees. The renovation work on the toilet drainage floor drain is also launched at the same time, and the hotel’s sound insulation renovation project will also be completed simultaneously. The hotel apologizes once again for the discomfort caused to your stay. We will further accelerate product improvement and effectively improve service quality. Hope you can visit our hotel again. 
0	"Let’s not talk about the novel written by Zhang Ailing herself. Now let’s talk about my views on the book ""Lust, Caution"". The cover design of this book is okay, but when I opened the book, I discovered that only the last few pages of the novel was the real novel ""Lust, Caution"", which suddenly gave people a feeling of being deceived. The success of the company that made this book lies in the fact that it has been made in a plastic package, so that readers can't see what is inside before buying it, and they are disappointed after buying it. It is catching up with the movie ""Lust, Caution"" and it is also selling with this book. Therefore, this book cannot be called a ""book"" in terms of operation, distribution and publication, and can only be regarded as a relatively successful product. "
1	"The paintings are very good, the proportions are very accurate, and the story is also very good. There are problems of divorce and death that we don't talk about with children in China, but they are not heavy at all. There are also some knowledge, such as the problem of wheat, which is really good. The child likes it very much. I took out a new book for him in 2 or 3 days (for fear that he will see a bunch of new books, so he will be bothered). He will look forward to it, ""Mom, I can give me a new Tom tomorrow"" I never read Until he likes a book so much, although it is estimated that it is for 4-year-old children, but the baby is more than 6 years old and likes it very much. I am considering buying the first set. "
0	Slowly reading one by one, the original cover of the book had problems, and finally found that the book content had problems with binding. I hope I won't receive books like this in the future, so I don't even want to buy them here, alas! I just ordered some more books, and I hope that these problems won't happen again. . 
1	1. The configuration is powerful, basically the top configuration. 2. Excellent workmanship and good craftsmanship. 3. The screen, graphics card and memory are all the latest generation technologies. 4. Small speakers work well 
1	The rooms are old, but the service is good. It is worth mentioning the western restaurant. In terms of food, I personally think that it can be ranked first in the city! 
1	The room is very large, and directly facing the Yangtze River, the view is very beautiful, but it seems that there are few places to eat nearby. 
1	Good price/performance ratio. The keyboard feels good, the configuration is OK, and the price plus the delivery are good. 
0	The article is similar to a colloquial narrative, and the examples cited are too short and unconvincing, as if they were fabricating facts to prove their views. 
0	The bezel of the screen should be narrower and the square size should be smaller. Without CD-ROM, it is troublesome to install CD-ROM software. 
1	This is a very good three-star hotel. The room facilities, the service quality of the waiters, and the attitude are very good, but the difference between the agreed price of Ctrip and the front desk price of the hotel is not much, I hope Ctrip will continue to work hard. 
0	I feel that the screen is smaller than other people’s 14-inch computers; it’s uncomfortable to hear the sound of the hard drive or the cpu fan when running; the graphics card seems to be bad, but why can’t I even run the new version of the tropical fish screensaver? ? ? Isn't that water? 
0	I took my family to stay for one night during the Dragon Boat Festival. I felt that the service was poor and could not reach the four-star standard. Below I will make a comment from both hardware and service aspects: 1. Hardware 1. The hotel is well located and prosperous; at night Very quiet (I stayed in the East Building); 2. The hotel room is very small (especially the bathroom), which is comparable to Hong Kong hotels; 3. There is no door handle in the room’s closet, which makes it very difficult to open; 4. The Simmons mattress is very Soft (good Simmons should be harder); 5. The soundproofing of the room is not good. On the night I checked in, there was a wedding room next to it. Many people were in the room and the sound was very clear; 2. Service 1. There was no toothbrush in the room, I I dialed extension 16 and asked for it, but the operator asked me to call another number (the hotel check-in card clearly stated that there is a requirement to dial 16 directly); 2. Go to the Chinese restaurant on the second floor for dinner, and the waiter told the Chinese restaurant to move to the same day The abalone restaurant is on the first floor; the waiter gave a menu of the abalone restaurant on the first floor. I asked the waiter for the Chinese restaurant menu, but the waiter said no. I asked, the Chinese restaurant moved to the first floor. Hasn’t the menu been moved down? At this time, the waiter reluctantly gave me the menu of the Chinese restaurant; 3. Because the reservation was made through Ctrip, he gave me a 20 yuan point card. After the meal, we gave the point card to the waiter. Since the waiter has already printed the bill and didn't want to reprint it, he said that you will use it again next time. We are from another place. I don't know it will be the year of the monkey next time; 4. Went to eat breakfast the next morning. Because the child (16 months old) refused to eat breakfast and was crying, the waiter came over and said to my child that he would spank if he cried! We can say this as parents, but your hotel attendants should never say this. I hope you apologize! 5. When you come and go after the meal, when you walk to the entrance of the restaurant, the waiter will look at you with his eyes, without even saying hello. Lived a lot of four-star, five-star, I have never seen such a rude. Hotel Feedback June 17, 2008: I sincerely apologize to you on behalf of the hotel for the unpleasantness that occurred during your stay. Thank you very much for your comments and criticisms, and we have also fed back your problems to the relevant departments , Conducted training and rectification. We hope to have the opportunity to provide services to you again, I believe it will make you feel different. 
0	When the book arrived, it was all wet, but I called your customer service and said that someone would be arranged to pick up the book and do the refund procedure. But now, I have ordered the book 3 times with you , The money that should be refunded that time has not been refunded, and the book that should be refunded has not been picked up? Is it too efficient? I have complained once, and I hope not this time. The complaint is not the content of this book, but the service attitude. Suffering from other complaints, both phone calls and online messages were used, but they didn't work, so try it here. 
1	"On the whole, quite good works are very well handled in detail and have not been calculated at all. The feeling of being deceived is completely different from watching ""The Summer of the Birds"". The interpretation of ""The Summer of the Birds"" is very far-fetched. Reluctantly, and all inexplicable coincidences, ""The Tragedy of X"" is justified and well-founded. It is full of enthusiasm. I am convinced by the author's superb reasoning and strict logic. The most important thing is that the echoes before and after the closing are very good to me. The appetite for the explanation of ""X"" is equally shocking and not regretful for buying this book "
0	The room is too old and too noisy. There is no hot water in the bathroom. It is recommended that Ctrip cancel and cooperate with it. Additional comment November 11, 2007: The service attitude is poor, the language is either too cold or cold, the room facilities are outdated. The bathroom is small. 
0	Absolutely rubbish book, ``It is worthless to read this book if you want to read history,'' Similar rubbish novels, It is not recommended for people who want to understand the history of the Ming Dynasty to read this book. of 
1	Very beautiful, much better than the picture, Samsung's is more delicate. It also feels good to use. The standby time is relatively long. 
1	The speed is good, there is no problem running Vista, and the XP recovery disk is included, which is more user-friendly. In the Thinkpak T400 sold in China, it is considered to be cost-effective. 
0	1. There are still some problems with heat dissipation. The right palm rest and touchpad of the C case are a bit hot, and the D case is too hot. 2. The USB port is too loose in workmanship. I wonder if it is an individual problem. 
1	Why does such a bland love make my mood ups and downs? The author's simple and unpretentious texts sometimes contain delicate descriptions. While subtle and subtle, they bury the touched details in our hearts and burst out wantonly at the last moment! After reading the story, I cried so thoroughly that the waiter in the restaurant watched me from time to time, for fear of any sudden actions. . . In today's society, such pure and beautiful love can really only be mourned and mourned? 
1	In the same grade of laptops, the cost performance is high, the configuration is sufficient, the brand effect is good, the appearance is good, and more advantages are to be discovered in use 
1	I stayed in the deluxe room in Building 5 in March. The environment of the hotel is really good. From the indoor display to the scenery outside the window, as well as the hotel’s inner garden, it looks luxurious and quiet. The hotel’s morning buffet is also delicious, both Chinese and Western, and there are still many choices. The only thing missing is that due to the late check-in time at the hotel on the first day, I hope to go to the hot springs after check-out the next day, but I am told that I can’t enjoy the preferential prices for hotel guests. I feel unfair... Hotel feedback 3, 2008 29th: Dear guest, hello! We have submitted your opinion to the leaders of relevant departments, and we will consider the time limit for the preferential hot spring price according to the actual situation. 
0	OMG, the system is hard to install! I thought the keyboard board was white, but after I received it, I found out that it was silver. I think the white one looks better with it! 
1	This is the best audiobook I have seen in China that is suitable for children to read and listen. The story is interesting and the pictures are vivid. Especially his reading is not as rigid, boring and even drowsy as many domestic books. The problem of sleeping, its sound is melodious and catchy, it is a rare children's book. Although my daughter is not completely able to understand, she can follow the recording to the mouth. I hope to publish more audio books like this so that children can appreciate beautiful English and become interested in English instead of studying for exams. 
1	"Buy it back, read the Zhou Yi first. I thought that Zhouyi was the most difficult Chinese character in China. After Mr. Nan's in-depth and easy-to-understand narration, he suddenly realized that he could challenge something difficult. Mr. Nan has a good knowledge of the past, has learned everything, and is proficient in the essence of several thoughts. The wisdom and knowledge in the book is even more casual and free. Mr. Nan is profound and not rigid. Reading his books will sometimes make you smile and feel ""it turns out to be this way"". Generally speaking, it is a good book worth collecting! Mr. Nan's knowledge is worthy of our study! "
1	"The baby is three and a half years old. This is a book that babies like very much. Good value. After I bought it, I asked to speak about this book for several days and nights. I like it very much. Seeing that Liangta left her mother, she was very sentimental and wanted to cry, saying: ""I can't bear Liangta."" Moreover, after reading this book with the baby, my voice would always choke up at the end of the story, because I can't bear the mother dragon. The separation of mother and baby Tyrannosaurus rex. This book is easy to understand, but it is also very good for older children. Both mothers and children can understand the love in the book, the love of the mother for the child, and the love of the child for the mother. "
1	The touching story that has been separated by a thousand years does not make me cry, but the author's writing skills are really admirable. The full text is so fluent that I almost can't stop it. After reading the whole work in one breath, it can't be said to be a heart-stirring love story, but The delicate outlines between the protagonists are subtle to the turbulent ups and downs, and they are completely portrayed as smooth and natural, almost like events that can happen in this era, and maybe one day in the future, our technology can really reach such a level. The author's exploration of history It can be seen that its true skills seem to allow readers to outline the style of history in their imagination.It is really a good work! 
0	Through Ctrip, I booked a room on July 26.27, 6 people and 3 standard rooms. In the early morning of the 26th, the brothers drove vigorously from Beijing, and did not want to be bombed by traffic police off the expressway in the Shenluan section of Beijing (the road ahead was closed) , I had to move slowly along the 102 National Highway for 9 hours (fortunately, the check-in time was extended by the midway call). When I arrived, I was blown away. The hotel said that there was no room on the 27th of the group. Knowing that on the 27th, I subcontracted to the Bowei Hotel privately. I didn’t spend too much money, but I can earn points...I had to come back and find Ctrip customer service to settle the account. Fortunately, Ctrip customer service is more accommodating. Hotel impression: 3 rooms: 2008, 4002,5002 (6 people and 3 rooms are not next to each other, dizzy...) The room door lock is not a card type, or a key (key? I only used the key when I lived in a guest house before), and the overall decoration of the room feels better Old, there are mosquito specimens on the wall, there is a drinking fountain, you can get cold water (later in Bowei Hotel, there is no drinking fountain, no cold water), the bathroom is small, the bathtub is dirty, there is no curtain, and the hot water is okay , At any time, 4002 toilet tank button can not be reset, every time you have to pick up the water tank cover (I told the main station when I left, I don’t know whether it was repaired or not), 2008 independent air conditioning, 4002,5002 central air conditioning, 5002 central air conditioning The air-conditioning is not good. I can't get cold after I call the main station 3 times in the middle of the night. I have to squeeze to 4002 in the early morning (severely affect 4002 guests to rest!), 3 rooms have no broadband, only a broadband line (what if there is no broadband and broadband line? What's going on???) Bring double breakfast (eggs, porridge, Hanamaki), and can't bring it back to the room, (there are brothers who slept in, but only brought back an egg), the transportation is good, it is convenient to get there, there are restaurants nearby, There are also pharmacies, and it takes about 5 kilometers to the beach (sports base). 
1	Not long ago, I saw that the online reviews of this set of books were very good, so I tried to order one set by mail. At first, my 5-year-old son was only interested in turning around. But later, the more he reads, the more he loves to read it. Now not only he loves to read this book, but our whole family is interested in this book. The reason why this set of books is good, I think it not only teaches us a lot of daily knowledge, but also impresses us. The original ideas and extensive knowledge embodied in this set of books are something I have never seen before in any book. So I recommend parents to share this book with your children too! 
1	Perfect screen! It looks beautiful! It feels great! The Pentium dual-core feels that the speed is not inferior, plus the independent display, great value! ! ! 
0	This is one of the worst value-for-money hotels you can see in Beijing. The service is good, but the facilities are obviously problematic. Considering the price, these problems make people very uncomfortable. For example, the 1# bathtub is not smooth. After that, I got the answer that the water pipe is too thin and the water can't flow down, so you can soak your feet in the shower. 2# There is an alarm clock at the bedside, but I screamed in the middle of the night when I encountered this toy twice, and I got up and unplugged in a daze. The price of the power supply is not low, the room facilities and environment are not so good, and the minor problems continue. After the hotel was renamed, apart from the increasingly obsolete facilities, I don’t know what other changes have been made-of course, the price has gone up after the rename. If there are other options, it is not recommended to live in this place. The business seems to be very good here, I might still go live, the only reason is that it is too close to the place I am going, but I am really upset about it-this hotel is at this price, killing pigs! 
1	1. The overall feeling is a bit old, and there are more stains on the carpet. 2. The service is ok. 3. The room always smells of smoke, I don't like it. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, and the keyboard is comfortable to use without too much restraint. Girls are still very good. Personally, its size does not affect the use. On the contrary, it is easy to carry. The best workmanship among similar products, but the price is also the most expensive. 
1	Put Xibao's comment here. In the first half of my life, after reading it, I felt very warm. Women really need to rely on themselves, and only they feel safe. I have always maintained a rational attitude towards marriage, but when I meet someone who treats myself well, I feel that I will be spoiled for a lifetime. In fact, there is no such good person. One day, you are no longer fresh. 
0	It's been a while since I bought it, and my three-year-old child doesn't like to watch it. On the one hand, the cartoons inside are not very concise and clear. On the other hand, many things do not appear in our Chinese habits, so there is no way to explain them to children. There is also the name and language used in the book, which children are not used to. I don’t know why this set of books is still the number one bestseller. The parents of children around me bought them for fame and left them at home. 
1	It is beautiful, the size of 15 is very comfortable to use, the price is reasonable, the quality is very good, and the configuration of all aspects is also very sufficient. 
0	The shell is a little bit teal in workmanship, there are burrs in some places, and the screen appears once. I don’t know if it will appear again. 
0	Because I bought it for the company, I used a check to charge some troubles, but in the end I got it, and the system is not pre-installed with windows. It seems that the product is not specified, but it is very fast to change the system. 
0	Chronicles, unlike novels, can’t be read by literature lovers. Office workers can also take a look at pastimes. Literature and art can’t be talked about, and there is no mood to appreciate it. The publicity is too exaggerated. My reading speed is still relatively fast, but this book only has more than 60 pages after two nights. My favorite book can read 150-200 pages in one night. 
1	The room is well maintained. The front desk service is also good. The room service is very good and the taste is very authentic. 
1	Perfect screen, brand new licensed, very quiet operation and good heat dissipation. The price is very affordable, not the graphics card, it is already very good for notebooks. 3D games run smoothly. 
0	I saw this book for the first time at the airport because I liked the packaging and everything, so I came to buy it and found it was not worth reading for my grandma who likes to read novels. She said that she couldn't stand it even if she talked about the things they had done at that time. 
0	The sound of the optical drive is loud, I don't know if it is a disadvantage? Another point is that the instruction software can only be installed on one computer? 
0	When receiving the goods, it was found that there was no CD, and the delivery person said that all the goods must be returned. In the end, I had to place another order. The other items to be bought were out of stock. I was worried. I don’t know if they will have no discs when they are delivered, and I have to return them because the book is intact. 
1	The overall feeling is pretty good, and it is more convenient to go to the commercial street. The breakfast category is quite rich, but the service ecology of fried eggs needs to be improved, so he shouldn't make a single fried egg. 
0	As a popular book with a reputation, it is about foreign companies in Guangzhou. It should be similar to my living environment. But at a glance, it was a far cry. Forget it, I also found that many of the rules have a strong corporate personality, that is to say, they are just examples, not routines. Just show us these old fried dough sticks. If you look at the freshman who yearns for or wants to know more about foreign companies, it is really easy to mislead them. 
0	As soon as I got this book, I was snatched by my colleague to read it, and it was returned to me the next day. Surprised! It turned out that she finished watching it all night. . . . Also communicated with me for a long time. After reading it, I felt very touching. Some of the stories in it seemed to have happened before. In general, it is a good workplace reference book 
1	In the white 10-inch netbook, this one from Samsung has the most beautiful paint film. It is indeed a good choice to give it to a girlfriend. 
0	There is only one partition, which is too awkward. Manual partitioning can also damage the system, but it is not bad, and it is restored with an automatic recovery system. But I reduced the price just two days after I bought it, which was too much for me. I don't know if there is a saying that the difference is made up. 
1	The domestically produced instincts do this, I am satisfied and generous, beautiful, and my wife also likes it. I used to be non-ibm and non-sony. Now I feel that the notebook is a low-value consumable. After two or three years, there will be a new price. It’s too expensive and it’s too cheap. I don’t dare to choose 6K-8K if it’s practical. If it’s a bit lighter or thinner or bigger, or good-looking, then choose 8K-10K. No need to 
1	The heat dissipation is quite good, the appearance is satisfactory, the cost performance is high, and the practicability is very good, which can meet daily needs. 
0	The location is too far, and it's hard to find in a deep alley. Moreover, the computer malfunctioned during the checkout, and the front desk casually said to come back tomorrow, or send it. If outsiders come back tomorrow? If it is a foreigner, do you also send it abroad? 
0	"I have read a lot of books adapted into TV series, and I feel that books are better than TV. This time is an exception. The book is almost exactly the same as the TV. The writing is not detailed enough, which is a bit disappointing. And the changes regarding Xu Sanduo are a bit unacceptable. How could someone who had performed so badly in all aspects before suddenly became ""distantly ahead"" after turning the horizontal bar? If he catches up with the others through hard work, how can he suddenly surpass the Shi Jin and others who were much better than him? Is it because everyone else has fallen behind, or has he become a genius himself? I have been a soldier myself, and I have seen many hardworking people, but I have never seen such a rapid progress. "
0	Looking at the photos, I think it’s pretty good, and it’s 4 stars, but there is nothing else except regret after check-in. The room is big but empty. Breakfast is available but there is nothing to eat. The environment is good but the weather is too cold. Anyway, I will never live there again. 
1	The heat dissipation is very good, the keyboard is also very comfortable, there are many small software, some are good to use~ The screen is no problem, in fact it is just LED backlight~ Haha~ 
1	The kindergarten teacher came to visit my home, and I introduced them to the books my children had read, including this set of books. The teacher said: She understands why my children don't like their kindergarten books, because the books at home are more interesting and beautiful than the kindergarten books. The child was less than two years old when he read this set of books. From the beginning, he was very enthusiastic to open every page and get happiness and surprise. Now there are more and more books accumulated at home, but every time he encounters these books, he will read it several times. My principle for choosing books for children is: a happy book is a good book, and knowledge is an excellent book while being happy. 
0	It is more troublesome to download without a driver, and you cannot install XP without changing the IDE channel! The fan sound is a bit loud! 
0	The built-in manual is incomplete, the manual is simple, and the xpsp3 system with N versions can not be started. Finally, I started the installation with the original XP CD......................... One afternoon has passed, I am exhausted! ! ! ! 
1	Good things, beautiful appearance, fast running speed, high cost performance, complete supporting functions, rich accessories, and free antivirus software, low noise, is a more practical notebook, generally enough for home or office 
1	Cost-effective, the configuration is not bad, the appearance is not bad, the screen looks very comfortable, and the delivery speed is fast. 
1	The details are considered very thoughtful and the workmanship is very good. Chocolate keyboard, I am not very comfortable, I guess girls like it, anyway, for lp, she said it's okay. 
0	The location is OK, which is probably the only advantage. The rooms are small and poorly equipped, so you can't take a shower. The most terrible thing is that there is no heating and air conditioning. But the attitude of the front desk staff is OK. 
1	This is the third book of CCTV incumbent host that I bought. Each has its own characteristics, each person's experience is different, the content expressed, and the world shown to our readers are also different. As far as this book is concerned, first of all, Rui Chenggang's own learning experience is very admirable. His honor is beyond his age. His growth process has been from Anhui's college entrance examination champion to the present host. Now he should be CCTV 2. The head economics host of Economic Channel. The content of the program is very deep, making people think while watching, and some of his views on the world in this book are also very unique. It's a good book. 
0	1. The price is 100 yuan higher than the price given to me by China Mobile, which is very bad. 2. The heat dissipation is a bit problematic, and the CPU cache is a bit small. Cannot run very large software. 3. The mobile TD tariff is not 150/month. Can I choose 100/month for 15 months? 
0	1. There is a problem with the printing of this book. There are a few pages of printing, which can not be shown to children at all, and it will hurt the children’s eyes. 2. The content is not very good. It is very difficult to tell children. The vocabulary book I will read is very impractical. In short, this book is not good. I suggest that you don’t read the recommendations and read more reviews. This is true 
0	I don’t know what’s going on. There is no problem during inspection and experience, but the optical drive squeaks after installing XP. I am looking for the reason. I hope this problem is temporary, or it’s really depressing. 
0	1 An anti-virus software has been installed on the computer, please do not install the anti-virus software again! The keyboard has a key lock, please press fn+f11, press at the same time, the first time users are not familiar with it, just know it. 3 The description of the computer manual is not detailed, please improve it. The battery life is about 7 hours, it doesn’t seem to be 9.5 
0	When people encounter so many unchangeable painful things, how many people can really face and endure them. Even if you end your own life to escape, you need a lot of courage. Why do people live may only be able to tell themselves with their lives! 
0	I hope Dangdang can carefully check the quality of each book before shipping. Although I got the book in plastic and it is very new, I didn’t read a few pages and found that several pages were blank. The specific ones are pages 12-13, 16-17, and 20-21. , Pages 24-25, quickly checked the last few pages of the next book, and finally there is no defect. Hey, a very good book, it was ruined. 
0	The hotel is quite satisfactory in Xining. First of all, the location is good and the population quality is not bad. Second, although the room settings are relatively simple, they basically meet the four-star standard. Third, the unsatisfactory area is the service problem. My friends in the hotel have already mentioned it. What I need to add is that the waitresses at the front desk are not as enthusiastic as the waitresses. Basically they are not those who can’t laugh or are more able to play NB. According to the other party’s theory, who made us outsiders? , It would be good if someone could give us a place to live. Finally, I want to say that breakfast is only Chinese. Although it is a buffet, there is basically no way to comment. I only mention one point. The orange juice for breakfast is hot. Tang Guozhen, which is already extinct in the market, is brewed. So I give 3 points for the room and 4 points for the environment, both are 1 point. 
1	I was worrying about communication problems with my 22-year-old son and found such a good book. This is the first time I have read Long Yingtai's book. The smooth writing, deep connotation, love for my son, equal care, and the sparks of collision of ideas are so beautiful and touching. Admire, appreciate! The gap between the two generations was slowly bridged in the beautiful words, which made me remember and think a lot. Recommend to my son and friends. 
1	"The words on the piles make people read very comfortable, like a clear spring, which is as refreshing as the heart. I have always liked it. In this book, I also feel the author's intentions, constantly seeking change and innovation. The author's previous male body for the female pig has been accepted by me for a long time, and I look a little awkward. Haha~ The structure of the story is magnificent and exquisite. There are too many intrigue calculations and many other foreshadowings. It is more like a drama than a romance. The emotional description in the story is slightly weak. In this regard, I feel not as good as ""Qingluo"". "
1	Concise and applicable. The required configuration is there. I was worried about dead pixels. The quality is reassuring after receipt. 
0	HP system installation is too troublesome, GHOST cannot be used, and system installation disk is necessary. I don’t know if my installation method is wrong. You have to change SATA to Ide in BOIS to install. It would be better if the case is black. 
1	"I have read the content of this book on the Internet a long time ago, more than the book. It is estimated that the book behind the author has not yet come out. I hope that the author will publish the book soon, because this is really a book worth collecting. I saw a different Qin Shihuang in the book, and I began to have a new understanding of why the emperor claimed to be a ""widowed man"". The book is rich in content, and some historical short stories are easy to understand. Although the author has added his own thoughts to some things in history, he still stands from the perspective of respecting history and his attitude towards history is worthy of respect. It's a good book! "
1	Thanks to the reviews from the tourists who have stayed before, I feel really good. The room is bigger than imagined. Hygiene and clean. Very close to the subway station. The hotel's services are also in place. The breakfast buffet in the hotel is relatively good value locally. The Sheng Kee Congee opposite is also recommended, it tastes good. 
1	"Recommended! At the same time, I also bought ""White Night Walk"" by Keigo Higashino. Compared with the book of female forensic doctors, Bai Yaxing is too ordinary. The plot description of ""The Chief Female Forensic Doctor"" is wonderful, it reads smoothly, the ending of the case is completely unexpected, and the case is fascinating. The description of crimes has always adopted an attitude of disgust and flogging. Unlike Japanese mystery novels, it is impossible to tell which side their values are facing. So it can also be recommended to students above middle school. "
0	I was misled by the comments, meaningless, the content was too good, and the reasoning was too naive, as if we were all idiots born in the 1980s. I think sisters and sisters still don't buy it. The examples given are all from South Korea, which is not suitable for us. 
1	I am a mother who often finds it difficult to educate children. My son is five years old this year. I feel like I am going crazy when dealing with some daily problems such as communicating with my son. Fortunately, I read this book. The language in the book is very concise and easy to understand, with many examples of pictures to make the author's ideas easier to understand. I feel that the key to the author's thoughts is to pay attention to and respect the children's emotions, and some specific scene settings and analysis are reasonable. I have already bought one, this one is for a friend. I hope all parents will read this book, and everyone will make progress together. 
1	The price is cheap and the configuration is good: T4200, GL40, SAMSUNG 1G (800). Adding a memory, it runs smoothly. The fan has a low sound and the weight of the whole machine is acceptable. 
1	1. The metal texture and the brushed surface are too perfect. 2. The keyboard is full and the keys are very comfortable. 3. It's okay to have two USB ports, and VGA can connect to the TV. 
0	"Enter the hotel at 12 noon on June 23, indicating that the hotel room was booked through Ctrip. Then I encountered a very uncomfortable experience: an unsmiling glasses-wearing receptionist said coldly: Your name. After answering, he continued to say coldly: Where to go through the formalities. She pointed her finger at another waiter who was helping the guest to register. After I walked over, I waited for a while, and another receptionist enthusiastically started to help me register. Because of the payment method I chose to swipe the card, the front desk asked me to go to the cold reception to check the card. Of course, I was not happy at this time, but the card machine was there and I had to walk back. If it is normal for service workers to use non-smiling expressions and cold words to receive reception, then excessive things will begin later. After swiping my card, my card was thrown on the table; the pen that asked me to sign was photographed on the table and made a loud noise; the credit card deposit slip refused to be delivered to me, asking myself Take; the most angry thing is when I said to the receptionist: send me the deposit slip. She slammed the door and went to the office. Zhenjiang Hotel, a so-called three-star hotel is such a service. When I called the assistant manager in the lobby later, the assistant manager leaned on his side and lay on the front desk and said to me: This waiter is like this, we can't do anything with her, I apologize for her, sorry, okay? I'm really speechless, ""I'm sorry, okay?"" I encountered such a thing when I first arrived in Zhenjiang, what can I say? This is my experience. If you have seen it, it is an experience. Additional comments July 23, 2007: Improving service levels and enhancing service awareness are issues that the service industry, especially the tourist city service industry, should pay attention to. Although I am only one of the many tourists, but I have encountered such a situation, Zhenjiang Hotel does need to be greatly improved, three-star should look like three-star! Seeing the hotel’s reply, I feel very relieved: those who want to make money are kind, and those who are gifted must learn. Hotel feedback July 13, 2007: Regarding what you reported, the hotel’s leaders attached great importance to it and immediately held a meeting of all guest room staff and all management staff, critically educated the staff involved and imposed financial penalties. The staff also realized I have a poor sense of service, and promise to improve service quality and awareness in the future work, and strive to do a good job in customer service. In order to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, the hotel's human resources department has retrained all managers and guest room staff on job functions, service functions and management functions, and strive to improve the hotel's service quality. We sincerely apologize to you again and hope you can stay in Zhenjiang Hotel again. "
0	The characters in the novel insist on saying that they are true, at least because of the writing of life above life. It is the author's guilty conscience to prevent others from verifying it. It is hypocritical and sensational and it is a work that is true. 
0	In summary, the point of view is not bad. But the sentence is too long and protracted, and a question is repeated N times with the same sentence. 
0	The color of the C-side and the appearance is a bit different, and the mouse or bag is not given. You have to buy it yourself. But it was garbage. 
0	I got the thing in the morning. It looks the same as the other sl400 I bought before, but it is a bit slower than it. I don't know if the quality is good or not. Now I haven't found the problem. It's okay. Now I have used it for a long time and I haven't found the problem, just slower 
0	I really don't like this style of writing, this simple and straightforward use of words. But my colleagues saw it very well and were moved to tears. Ugh--------- 
0	I have stayed at the Renaissance Nissan Hotel many times, but I feel that the service is worse than every time! As an international chain brand hotel, I actually have to check the room when I check out, and I feel that I have no trust in the customer! 
1	If I was brave at the beginning, would the ending be different? If you persisted at the time, would the memory be like this? My young love, you carve scars and time on my body. In those nights where teary eyes met, I still remember that you were love itself... When I was young, I thought that love could surpass everything. I didn't understand that there is another power in the world called fate... I like these words. . . . . Love is so helpless. . . . Obviously love each other but can't be together. . . . Hey~~~The plot of the book is so tangled~~The ending is not bad~~The sad ending is more memorable. . . 
1	Regarding what women should do and how they should live, this is no longer clarified by words, so let yourself become a happy person first, and no longer expect others to give yourself the so-called happiness. If human nature is correct, then right Self-confidence is a basic requirement for transcending human nature. It’s good to open your heart and see everything. Loving yourself is logically “selfish” in language, but it is actually selfless. Don’t mind filling yourself up first, because for someone who is right Only those who are rich in themselves can love with a gentle heart. I only looked through the book I bought for my mother, and it was okay, ha ha. 
0	The overall quality of this hotel is very poor, there is a strong smell of oily smoke in the room. 
0	The master who helped me install the system said that the system of this book is not generally difficult to install. All versions of XP have been tried and cannot be installed. It seems that the internal system requirements are relatively high. There is no way to install Vista, but it is used. Has little effect. 
1	The rooms are ok, and the service can be seen to be good, but it is always close. But the room at this special price feels good. There is free washing powder. This is the first time I have seen it. It seems that the housekeeping staff has worked hard. It is recommended that leaders go out to see the same type of hotel facilities will be a lot of inspiration. The water in the bathtub is very slow. If you take a shower for more than ten minutes, you should consider stopping the water and waiting for it to flow away slowly. If you take a bath, it means that your ankles are flooded with foam. Hurry up and improve~ 
0	The only thing I can’t understand is that when the CPU and memory usage are low, the mouse displays waiting, as if it’s crashing. I don’t feel how powerful the 8600 is, and I am puzzled. . . 
1	Living alone feels a bit luxurious for the price of 600 yuan, but the environment is OK, better than expected, and cleaner. The amount of water is sufficient. According to the waiter, the bedding is changed daily. I heard that the water on the mountain is 48 yuan|ton. For the exhaustion of Huangshan, it is very important to take a hot bath and sleep comfortably. Overall it is still very good. 
1	Convenient to carry, I don’t like to play large-scale games. It’s enough to watch movies on the Internet in temporary office. Bring it when I go out. When I go home, I can connect with a 23.6-inch monitor CD-ROM drive. More than two hundred, which is better than three thousand books. 
1	The external environment is good, the hotel has several buildings, very pleasing to the eye, the lobby is quite quiet, and the decoration is also very petty bourgeoisie, maybe it is just the end of Golden Week. I stayed in a room of 240 yuan in the main building. The four-star price should be very worthwhile in China. The breakfast is buffet, mainly Chinese style, with many varieties, which suits our Chinese people's stomach. When I checked out, I realized that there is a more economical annex building (like Zhanhong Building), which only costs more than one hundred yuan, but there is no star. (The door is still being remodeled) Try it next time. Worth recommendation... Additional comments October 10, 2007: Yes, there are free fruits, very warm feeling, broadband speed is also very fast. 
0	The battery life is not constant, usually about one and a half hours (depending on the usage, the usage time is slightly different). 
0	This ghost place is actually a Samsung. It’s hard to believe it. 
1	I also bought it after reading the reviews. As soon as I bought it, my son picked up Adventures on the Deserted Island and was very interested. He asked him why he looked good. He said that it was the content of the story, and some of the mathematical knowledge in it was not understood. Slowly understand, so I also read the previous point, some mathematics knowledge is the content of Mathematical Olympiad, the third grade children do not understand, but are willing to read the book, indicating that the content of the story is still very attractive to him, I feel good. After I bought it and sorted it out, the twenty-seven books were written for children, elementary and middle school students, middle school students, teenagers and math lovers. 
1	The duvets, pillows, and towels are thick enough to have a four-star feel, and they are also very clean. Nice shower. But the room decoration is average. Breakfast is good, but expensive. Overall it feels expensive. 
0	"The reserved executive room is facing the utility room, and they are always open, not to mention the mess. After requesting to change the room, the air conditioner in the room is not cooling, and the refrigerator is turned to the bulldozer. Decoration, I don’t know what Ctrip is having with this hotel. I always feel that I am deliberately making you uncomfortable. In addition, there are no internal instructions on the phone in all rooms, so I let the guests call back to the hotel by long distance. Why is that.. It really affects the harmonious environment of Beijing’s appearance and the Olympic Games. The smell of the restaurant delivery in the room will make you spit out. This is the most ""unforgettable"" hotel I have stayed in. I have restrained these words. . "
1	This is a repetitive and readable book. When I can’t finish reading it. In this age when the pressure is full of every corner of society. It really needs something to ease it. Words are the best way to express it. Although it may just be Lin Xi Personal thoughts, but for some people who have no way to vent, and don’t know how to use words to vent their boredom, the words in this book are just right. Find the source of your suffering from inability to vent, go to introspect and think. From time to time and casually Turn to a text, read it, and think about it. It is indeed a lot of benefit. 
1	Children were born in the United States and grew up in the United States, but their nature like dinosaurs is not separated by language. This is a gift for my brother’s 5th birthday, but it’s a pity that the Children’s Dinosaur Encyclopedia travelled all the way across the ocean. It took about two months to get to Boston. Children like it very much, like reading and watching. The five-year-old brother often reads to his sister, although he often reads wrong words. Next, I bought another encyclopedia of plants and animals. 
0	The content is empty, the language is grandiose, the whole book is not systematic, just like a bad doctor practicing medicine. This is the worst book I bought from Dangdang. 
0	It is not so much a hotel as a guest house. The breakfast variety is small and the quality is not high. The most unacceptable thing is that the breakfast utensils (plates, bowls) are full of water. After that, the water was cleaned at all, I'm afraid it's not even more important to disinfect. Additional comments October 8, 2007: Oh, forget it, the hotel delivers fruit, which is good. 
1	The location is good, the service is okay, I hope Ctrip's prices will be more competitive in the future 
1	Fast delivery. In addition, the configuration is the same as the description. I won't talk about it here. Everyone see for yourself. What needs to be mentioned is that I sent the basic installation disk of Vista. But it's useless, ready to change XP. 
0	I changed the room twice. When I first checked in, the room was dirty. It was already 2:30 in the afternoon. Then I changed the room. The hot water was broken. Then I negotiated with the lobby manager and changed the room again, saying that it was Upgrade. As a result, the air conditioner was broken, which made me catch a cold in the morning. Then I went out to do errands, I called the front desk and asked them to send someone to fix it, and it turned out. . I returned to the hotel this afternoon and no one came to fix it. What four-star hotel is this? ? ? The facilities are also terrible, the TV is very small. The price/performance ratio is too low. A mess! ! ! ! ! 
0	Yesterday I wrote a review with excitement, and today I encountered an uproar. Because I recommended this set of books to many friends, my friends dragged me to buy them online, but I bought three sets the day before yesterday. The delivery was quite fast, but I only gave it. Three copies of 1, no 2, why is it that the goods on an order are not all returned? I have sent a return application, but I don’t know if it can be returned, but I actually don’t want to return it. I just want to buy the whole. You can call and ask twice, once. If it is in stock, let me place an order again. I said that it was out of stock. Don’t place an order. What can I do? I have been in the business for many times and have not encountered this situation. The person who responded said that it was because the web page was updated slowly. , How can it be so slow? 
1	The appearance is very beautiful and the performance is also good. There is no problem after reinstalling the XP system. The drivers are installed, but it is not Sony’s sony only provides drivers for vista. You need to find the xp drivers on the Internet. 
1	Because the Yuehua Hotel has no rooms, I decided to set up the Quanzhou Hotel through Ctrip. Although my favorite is Yuehua, in fact, I feel that the decoration and style of Quanzhou Hotel is better than Yuehua, that is, the service and breakfast are worse than Yuehua. 
0	The law of fairness seems to mean that we must be fair at all times, otherwise we will suffer retribution! But in the end, I didn't figure out what fairness is. The book tells a lot of the personal experience of the author, and it feels like I am writing about how awesome I am, and it doesn't mean much! 
0	I got it in the original package. After unpacking, the outside of the machine is a bit dirty, and I feel upset. This is related to Lenovo! After reading the manual, it was useless. I thought of this a long time ago. Because Tianyi used to be. Power on and enter the BIOS, everything is OK in the outer box! The screen is perfect! The keyboard is not as easy to use as in the legend! word count limit 
1	I like to check out recent new books on Tencent. If you are interested, just read the beginning. I saw this book a few days ago and found it very interesting and easy to understand. The content includes learning psychology, economic psychology, and interpersonal Relationship psychology, self-management psychology, and love psychology are closely related to our lives. The author tells stories in the form of comics and uses terminology to help us solve our troubles around us. The quality of the book is very good, and I think it can also As a gift for friends, it is a book that students and white-collar workers should read. Haha, top it! 
0	The content of the book is very good. I bought a set for my daughter before, and my daughter liked it very much. I also want to give a set to the teacher’s child because it’s almost past Children’s Day. I bought it myself and the interval between purchases was not enough. Half a month, but it can be delivered by express delivery, cash on delivery, but this time, you have to pay first, and you have to send it by surface mail, so it takes a week longer than the last time, and it takes 11 days to receive Goods. After receiving the goods, I was even more disappointed. The original plastic film was all damaged. A set of four books with 16 folds was still folded. After the book was opened, it was damaged, and the writing still showed signs of breaking. How can I give it away? Because I often read my children’s books, I can’t bring them to give away. I received this kind of goods and saw this kind of service. It’s so disappointing. I have purchased books many times in Dangdang, express delivery I was very satisfied with the books I received. This time, the books I wanted to give away made me very embarrassed and angry. I hope that Dangdang's service can be normal and not to change. If it is still by surface mail, I am not there. I bought your book. At the same time, I also bought the magic school bus. The outer skin of the book is damaged, but there is no crease, which is better than the appearance of that set of books. 
0	I bought several cartoons for my nephew. He likes this one the most, and he never gets tired of it. A plate can be watched for several hours. Repeatedly, he still laughed. 
1	Haha, after all, it is the best hotel in the local area, so, in addition to facilities 
0	I have booked and stayed in this hotel many times. Personal feeling is getting worse now. It was about 3 o'clock in the morning on 6/17. The train arrived in Suzhou. It was about 4 o'clock when I arrived at Jindi Constellation. I thought I could check in as smoothly as before. The receptionists were all asleep on the stage, waking them up, hoping to check in. The answer was: no, there are only 2 hours until 6 o'clock, and the check-in is only possible after 6 o'clock. If you check in before 6 o'clock, you must pay one day's room rate. I asked if I could provide convenience, charge by the hour or let me live first, and complete the relevant procedures after 6 o'clock (this was done before). The receptionist was very rude and said there was no way. Either wait or go. NND and LZ are in a rage, but you can't care about these people. I went out 30 meters from the back door (Furenfang), and stayed in Hanting. The service attitude made people feel really at home. The settlement is based on one day's room rate. What needs to be explained is that the rooms and facilities are exactly the same as those of Jindi Constellation. It’s just that there was no breakfast, and the manager on duty gave me 15 yuan as compensation. The housing price is only half of Jindi Constellation. After all, in a word, next time I will definitely not live in Jindi Zodiac again. Hotel Feedback July 7, 2008: First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for staying in this hotel many times! The hotel leadership attaches great importance to the problem you raised and has carried out rectification. This hotel gives the following explanations on your check-in time question: According to industry regulations, this hotel only counts the room rate for guests who check in after 06:00 every day. Your check-in time for the first two visits to this hotel is 06:06 (August 24, 2006), 05:59 (May 22, 2008). At that time, the receptionist offered a workaround, and you arrived at the hotel at 03:45 in the early morning of June 17, which was 6 off the regulations; There is a long time difference between 00 and the receptionist at that time gave you a full explanation. Nevertheless, we will still accept your comments humbly, and we will work around this situation in the future. Once again, I sincerely welcome you to stay at this hotel next time. 
0	The packaging is exquisite, the content is flashy, and the Korean humor is really not good! It doesn't sound good, it's just shit! 
0	I swear, I won't stay in this hotel again, the service is very poor, the 4-star hotel has no doorman to open the door and pick up luggage. Only the security urged TAXI to leave immediately, even if our luggage is still in the back box! ! ! ! Additional comments September 1, 2006: Hey, anyway, Ruian has a very bad impression of the city. TAXI often refuses to load and has a very bad temper. The city is dirty and the service is the worst in the country! 
0	The content of the article is seriously out of touch with reality. Although the novel allows fiction, it shouldn't be so. And the narrative plot is very confusing. Although I can understand it in the end, it makes people dizzy and uncomfortable after reading it. 
0	In fact, the whole book wants to say that when it is not too late to start reading for children. (This is known before I buy this book) There is no real answer to the question about reading to children. Many questions are said and not said the same. There is really no need to waste time watching. 
0	It was very hot. After I bought it, it was printed beautifully, but I felt it was not deep enough. Not worth collecting. But you can consider reading to your children after reading, it's a choice to get in touch with traditional culture from the shallower to the deeper. 
0	Except for the location, the others are a mess and horrible. Similar to a guest house. 
1	[Recommended Books] Friends who like Wilde's aesthetic style must not miss it. The fairy tale collection is suitable for both adults and children. 
1	The room is very comfortable and I am personally very satisfied. The office desk suits my personal usage habits and the internet speed is good. The big bed and bathroom are good. Hotel Feedback January 16, 2008: Thank you for your good evaluation of Dalian Yinfan Hotel! The recent business room upgrade promotion activities have received unanimous praise from many customers. This is a recognition of the new room and a good resource for further optimization of our room! Welcome to Yinfan Hotel! If necessary, contact me through the switchboard! 
1	In appearance, Apple uses a 13.3-inch compact body with a pure and beautiful Apple classic white body. The corners of the whole machine are treated with small arcs and smooth, with extremely simple lines. The keyboard is soft to the touch, and the operation is outstanding! The touch panel area is large. The machine is also equipped with an isight camera; in configuration, the machine is equipped with an Intel Core 2 dual-core p7350 processor, clocked at up to 2.0G, 3M L2 cache, 1066MHZ front-side bus, standard 2G memory and 120G hard drive, built-in DVD burning The machine, equipped with NV9400 discrete graphics, meets daily needs without any problems! 
0	However, when the goods were picked up today, the service at the headquarter’s self-pickup point was not very good, and there may not be many people. The questions I asked were not very satisfactory. 
0	The service is very poor, the environment is not good~ I suggest not to go~ I booked it a week in advance, and ordered an extra bed. When I arrived at the front desk, I told us that the room that can be added to the room is gone, and I can't add an extra bed now~~ Then I called Ctrip to help communicate , It was resolved, the solution was to move out the chairs and tables in the room, and then add a bed, we almost have no space for activities.~~~~~~ In short, they would not agree to anything to the service desk. , Can't be resolved. Very unhappy. Later we found out that there was a big room with extra bed empty, but it was not opened for us, it was really an unpleasant memory 
1	The screen is large, the speed is fast, and the configuration is complete enough. Installing XP system by yourself is much better than pre-installing VISTA 
1	"The location of the hotel is better. There is a ""Dunhuang Seafood Restaurant"" nearby and good morning tea. There is also a large supermarket ""Mackaile"" not far away. The overall price-performance ratio of the hotel is medium to high. "
0	Ctrip’s description is wrong. It’s not a “premium business hotel” at all. It should be a “cannon shop” like Motel 168. The whole room is decorated in a red tone, similar to a brothel. The bed is indeed round and there are cockroaches at night. When I checked out, the front desk couldn't figure out how to convert the pre-authorization into consumption. After a long time of tossing, during the period, I kept putting forward plans such as cash settlement. Under my insistence, I finally succeeded in consumption. Hey, I can't help it! ! ! 
0	The base is relatively hot, but the discrete graphics card can understand it. Plan to add a cooling base. Changing the memory is troublesome, because the base does not have screws. You have to remove the speaker and then take out the keyboard to install the memory. The collection of fingerprints on the panel and keyboard is very serious. 
0	Elevator maintenance, can only climb stairs, the room is not big, the facilities are average. There wasn't even a headlight in the room, only a distant desk lamp dangling dimly. The most terrifying thing is that outside the windows is the corridor, and the sound insulation is basically zero. As long as someone walks and talks, there will be echoes and noises. In the morning, the hotel staff walked by wearing slippers laughing and joking, so you don't want to sleep. 
0	The content of the story is a bit deep. You can only understand it after going to elementary school like Galileo and Columbus, but the chicks in the story are still very cute. Although the daughter can’t understand, she likes chicks very much. 
0	The waiter has a terrible attitude! ! ! I didn’t say I lost the order, but I found an excuse for the shift. The front desk clerk rolled his eyes when the guest complained. Additional comments June 10, 2008: I lost my order and made several phone calls. Ctrip and the hotel pushed the ball, and the front desk and the reservation office of the hotel pushed the ball. The attitude of the front desk was still quite bad. I will never stay in this hotel again! ! After reading the previous reviews, it seems that this is not the first time that an order has been lost. For this kind of hotel that does not take the order seriously, Ctrip has also included it as a partner. If you want to keep it, you must strengthen the monitoring. Book! ! ! 
1	The book I am interested in because of the introduction, the subject is also very fond-homicide plus suspense plus reasoning, praise! After reading it, I felt very frustrated. I really have a big gap from the genius~~~~ In order to know the ins and outs, I read half of the book in one breath. It was not until the last dozen pages of truth that it peeled off slowly but strongly! The author’s writing style is very concise, there is no extra words to show off, every word becomes an indispensable framework for the storyline~~~ It has no sensational intentions at all, but it can make people tears at the end~~~ I can’t help but think, For the one I love, what can I and willing to sacrifice? 
0	The earphone and USB are on the right hand, which slightly affects the use of the mouse; because there is no CD-ROM drive as standard, students who are accustomed to using CD-ROMs suggest to buy another USB one in case of emergency. And the boot is so slow 
1	I have just finished my 4-day tour, and I am very satisfied with the three days at YMCA. First of all, the transportation is convenient. The subway entrance is only 2 minutes from the door, and the Yau Ma Tei station has two subway lines. Especially in the morning, you can take the subway to eat porridge, and at night you don’t have to worry about not coming back. (This subway station closes at 12:45) It is clean again, I don't know if it is newly renovated. The color of the wall and bed cushions are very coordinated. The bathroom is big enough. (Compared to general Hong Kong hotels) The room we stayed in was triangular, and the lighting in the bedroom and bathroom fit the structure of the room very well. The faucet has a lot of water, and there are wall-mounted hair dryers, safes, and small refrigerators. . It's all good. The attitude of the waiter is also very good. Probably because this is a hotel belonging to the Christian Church. Therefore, every guest met on the face is smiling and feels very kind. Anyway, if a friend goes to Hong Kong, I will definitely recommend this one, and I will choose this one next time I go. 
1	"If you have read Baby Annie's book, and feel like it. Well, this book will definitely not disappoint you. Because it is still the style of Baby Annie. My favorites are ""The Flower of the Other Side"" and ""The Sober"" by Baby Annie. It was the first time I read Ann's book when I was most desperate, and it brought salvation. So I am very grateful to Ann, and admire Ann. She is one of my favorite writers. I remember that I put ""The Awakening"" by the bed every night, and read a few pages at random before going to bed so that I could fall asleep peacefully. "
1	I won’t say much about the content of the comments, I haven’t read it yet, but I won’t buy it if it’s not good-looking~ I want to talk about the quality of the book, because every time I buy a book in Dangdang, I want to get news about the book itself. , But it seems that few people write ~ I was in Guangzhou, and the book I bought the day before yesterday was delivered to my door at noon today. The quality of the book is very good and it is absolutely genuine. The cover is simple and beautiful, but it is a pity that one corner is a little folded, which is very sad...There are bookmarks, two Douban bookmarks, and four small straw paper bookmarks. I like the texture. So be it, write a complete book review after reading it 
1	For the order placed at 4799, the price became 4699 when received, and an anti-virus CD was presented. Then, because of the newly added gifts, I could not apply for price protection. This is obviously a small method for Jingdong to evade price protection. Let me Very unhappy! 
1	The black appearance is very beautiful, haha, the overall running speed is not bad, the color of the screen is quite bright 
1	The heat dissipation is very good, and the wind blown by the fan is always cool! The appearance is classic and stylish, and I think it is a good value in similar machines! 
1	Average facilities are good, other average breakfast is also good 
0	The new machine crashed once when it was turned on, and then it ran normally. The camera effect is average, especially at night when there is no light. You may not be very used to this touchpad from Asus, and it feels a bit hard. 
1	Exquisite, although the workmanship is not as good as the Z series, it is also considered to be the best in the notebook, and the price/performance ratio in Sony's notebook is relatively excellent. (At the same time, I mentioned the above comment. The SONY system is hidden in the hidden partition of your hard disk. It can be directly burned through the burning software that comes with the notebook. The operation is completely foolish, and your cost is nothing more than buying a copy. Only empty) 
1	A book that is worthy of consideration by all young Chinese people. It seems that the truth is too ideal and too far away from the real level of the public. In fact, it is not the case. Today's Chinese people are too practical and realistic at a young age. There should be some unrelated material and unrelated pursuits in life. In fact, everyone has had it when they were young, but now that memory ends earlier and earlier when everyone reaches the end of life. , You will find that you remember only those simple and impractical times, and only those memories that have touched yourself 
1	Price advantage, good appearance, beautiful piano paint. The few things I sent were pretty good! Delivery is faster! 
0	There is no storyline, all the protagonists are narrating, the relatives around him have died one by one, but he is still alive! It's so exhausting! Can't stand novels with such themes! 
1	The breakfast is good, the bathroom is good. The room is quite big, the location is 22 yuan taxi fare from Yuhuatai. 
0	The screen is widescreen, so it looks very small. The keyboard feels bad. It’s not as good as expected. I thought HP had changed it............, the rear cover design is seriously despised, and the memory is upgraded. Hey, remove from the keyboard. Drop... 
0	The phone number of the pick-up point in Asian Games Village has been unavailable. It is really hard to find the place and the customer service attitude is not good! 
1	I knew this book. I saw it on the homepage of Dangdang. I didn't go to the forum much, so I didn't know that there was this book before. It took two nights to finish reading this book. The general feeling is done in one go. The characters in the book are deeply imprinted in the 1980s. People of our generation and beyond can’t experience it personally. You can only sigh after reading it. It can only be seen as a novel. It is a kind of leisure. Perhaps, it is of educational significance to some people...I admire the planning of this book. Except for the main text (which is already very good), there is basically no waste in advertising. It is really talented! 
1	2699, the price is invincible, it is 300 cheaper than the so-called lowest price I asked for. The performance is also very good. The standby time is under test, and it is impossible to be the same as the official 9.5 hours. 8 hours is not a big problem 
0	When I checked in, I said that I had not received a reservation from Ctrip, but I still gave Ctrip the price. I asked about breakfast before giving the meal roll. The breakfast was very poor, the room was very unclean, there were watermelon seeds on the bed, and there was an empty box of leftover jelly behind the bedside table. The most annoying thing is that when I checked out, I didn't return the credit card to me after the checkout. I only found out when I checked out for dinner at night. 
1	It feels okay, but not as good as Shangri-La, and the price and agreement are no different. So it is more cost-effective to go to Shangri-La. 
0	The temperature of the palm rest is relatively high, but the test temperature is okay. Anyway, it doesn’t affect the speed. Others are okay. There is also a wireless network card slot. I haven’t found it for a long time. 
1	This hotel is generally good, the arranged room just can see the sea, but it seems difficult to communicate in Mandarin~ I will book next time 
1	A good book that combines fun and knowledge. Because there are a lot of things that are difficult for children to understand, my approach is to reread the last insect story every day, and then read a new insect, so that the child can have a deeper understanding of an insect. Observe the child’s facial expressions while reading, ask questions about some things, and see how well the child understands. At first I was worried about whether it would be too rigid, but after reading it, I found it was great. Some insects treat children just like humans, with good intentions. The child was moved to cry after reading the sand bee last night. I really envy the children now. 
0	The settings in the Bios are needed, which is troublesome to install XP. The drive disk cannot be used in the XP system, which is troublesome. 
1	It is not easy to have such a hotel in Gansu. It is much better than Sunshine Building. It is first-rate in terms of hardware facilities and service level. Suggestion: The swimming pool is too cold and the room rate includes breakfast. 
1	1. Internal and external repairs: the external materials are innovative, and the internal performance takes into account the powerful performance of Thinkpad. 2. Fast delivery speed. 
0	1. The widescreen is really uncomfortable. Who invented the widescreen? 2. The battery seems to be short on standby, the first time it is fully charged, mine can only display for 2 hours 
0	1. There was no record when checking in, saying it was a problem with Ctrip. 2. Standard room stairs, corridors, and rooms are covered with carpets, very dirty and smelly. 3. The stairs happened to be cleaned, and there was no mark after the detergent was used, and almost fell. After washing, the entire stairs were covered with white cloth, and the guests stepped in a mess. 4. The room is very small, especially the bathroom, it is very difficult to even turn around after entering. 5. The sink in the bathroom was broken and the water could not be drained, although the master was later asked to repair it. 6. The windows of the room can only be opened at a small angle, which is very uncomfortable. 7. There are several waiters who are facing you and walked over with blank expressions. It's incredible. (One of them happened to be the male waiter who checked in for me) 8. The air-conditioning sound was the loudest in the hotel I have ever stayed in and had to be turned off at night. 9. I went back to the hotel at 12 noon. The room hadn't been cleaned yet, so I called the cleaner and replied that I was very busy and it was not yet my turn. In short, it is not recommended to stay. Hotel feedback July 8, 2008: Thank you for your valuable comments and suggestions to the hotel, the above 9 items, the hotel has taken it as the theme of the July training, can create a beautiful, warm and comfortable for all guests Living environment, the hotel will continue to work hard! Thank you this friend and look forward to your stay again! 
1	"When my son was six and a half years old, I took out the ""Nanny Dog Conspiracy"" that I had bought for more than a year and read it to him. My son was very interested and even read it for himself when I was not free to study for him. From this book, my son is no longer afraid of a pure text book without pinyin and without too many pictures. He has seen ""Spring in Cherry Groove"" all the time from ""The Conspiracy of the Nanny Dog"" in one breath. I watched it when I had time. After watching it, the two of us started to discuss what character and plot we liked the most. My son was obsessed with it, and I watched it with gusto. "
1	Not a good book for 3700 yuan, the video memory is 64-bit wide! Running the game is still a little bit worse. The memory stick is Samsung DDR3. I installed a single Kingston 2G memory. It runs pretty well without conflict. Many people say that the system is not easy to install. I think it should be your own system disk problem and settings. After setting the CD to start, you can choose to enter WINPE and then re-format and install. The machine will be cloned within 20 minutes! 
0	When playing high-definition movies, there are serious jagged edges. If you are cold in this area or want to use this book to watch movies and TV, it is recommended to consider it 
1	Construction project management practice is a very professional and practical book. Compared with a large number of similar professional books published in China, it gives people a brand new feeling when reading and using it. In fact, the expert communication, he is showing you a professional, standardized, and operable project management template. For people who are in the rough and random management environment that is currently popular in China, studying this book carefully will bring great inspiration. For those engaged in project management, it can be a fine book! 
0	There are not many words and the pictures are wonderful. I personally think it is more suitable for younger children, such as first grade or preschool children, but the words do not have pinyin, which restricts children's reading. The quality of the book is not bad. 
1	It is not easy to find a room at such a cheap price in a four-star hotel in Dalian. At first, I was hesitant. What is the 260 yuan room like? After moving in, I feel that the room is still ok, no different from the normal room. There are windows and Internet access. It is spacious for one person. It is especially suitable for business people and the price/performance ratio is relatively high. The location of the hotel is very good, just in the commercial center, shopping, eating is very convenient, the night view is beautiful, it is a good hotel. 
1	"The book includes ""The Other Side"" and ""Tian Hanu"". The content is not as bizarre and exciting as the first book, but it is as good-looking as the first book, especially ""Tian Hanu"". It analyzes the same origins of dragons and people, and explores It describes the nature of magic, describes Jed's life after returning to ordinary people, and can better express the author's thoughts of unity between nature and man and respect for nature. The translation of this set of books is fair, not as bad as some readers commented, and there seems to be no other version in China. Besides, I think that such a good story will not be obscured by translation. I still recommend this book. "
1	"Step by step is the first step I read through the novel. At that time, when I saw the old version of the title and the style of the illustration, I thought it was a youth novel read by young children. I didn't take it to heart and wanted to flip through it casually. Unexpectedly, this look was out of control, and I finished it in one breath, and tears flowed down my face. For many years, I didn't look at romance, and for many years I was not moved by love. This time I was trapped by Tong Hua. The exquisite text, grand historical background, and exquisite description of sceneries like ""Scary Step by Step"" are really rare works in romantic novels. They are worth collecting and worth reading. "
1	I stayed on the 9th floor of the executive floor (28th floor), the facilities are good, the service is good, but the elevator is too old. 
1	The environment of the hotel is good, the transportation is convenient, and the quality and attitude of the service staff are even better! This time I went to give us a free upgrade to a business room, the room is big and beautiful! We will definitely choose it next time we go! 
0	There must be some shortcomings, there are abnormal noises in the CD-ROM drive when it is turned on and off, it is not easy to install XP, always blue screen, technical problems. . . . . . . . Khan~~~~~~~~~~~ After Vista starts, the memory occupies about 70, why not pre-install XP? 
0	The name of Dangdang does not match the truth, and the order will not be delivered for many days. Asking the customer service will only defer, and will only ask the user to place another order. Such service can't keep customers. It is better to go to other websites to buy books. 
0	The most satisfying thing about this stay is that the arranged floor is relatively high, so it is very quiet, but the attitude is very poor!!! After I went in, I saw the standard room A special price, I asked, they said it was old decoration, and tactfully refused the request for viewing. I gave up or stayed in the standard Class B room originally booked, and then took a bath. The hair dryer ran out but there was a problem and couldn't be put back to the original place. I called the reception desk to find someone to see it. It was about half an hour later that no one came up. I hurried out and went to the reception desk to explain it again. I returned to the hotel about 12 o'clock in the evening, but it was still the same. I don’t know if no one came to see it or they couldn’t figure it out. I checked out the next day. , There are three people at their reception desk, but I feel that they are all together, the operation is very unprofessional, which is far from the standard of 3 stars, and the advantage of staying in this hotel is that you can make long distances for free, but I only learned about it later By the way, it turns out that all hotels in Liuzhou have signed an agreement with China Telecom to make long distance calls for free. Anyway, I will not choose this hotel again next time. 
0	The room is a bit old, I felt a little disappointed once, and breakfast is not included, it is more expensive to order on the second floor 
0	Before our guests stayed at this hotel, they have always had a good impression of the hotel, but this time 
0	The system with the original machine will not be used. It is more cumbersome to install XP by yourself. I hope that Jingdong can provide free system installation services. 
0	The price of 338 yuan/standard room at this hotel is absolutely not worth it, I don’t know what the airline hotel’s pricing standard is. The toilet was not disinfected at all. I checked in the night before, and after using the toilet, my butt itch has not subsided. In addition, breakfast restaurant It is also pitifully small, and the variety and quantity of food are also small.If you go for breakfast late, you will not be able to eat it. 
1	The writing is so good that I dare not comment on it easily. The delicate and soft words all reveal the deep love and protection of my mother. I still remember An An, a boy who wanted to be a princess, and An An who had to walk for 70 minutes after school was 15 minutes away. My unlovable An An was shining with big eyes. Of course, I also remember Feifei who covered my brother and shouted not to hit. It's so cute! I especially want a baby after reading. Yes, I am also willing to wait a lifetime for him to tie the bow calmly and use his five-year-old fingers. Take your time, kid!

1	After graduating from university for more than a year, from school to society, I gradually adapt and get used to the people, things, and bad situations around me... Live with good wishes. But irritability, restlessness, dissatisfaction... all sentiment rages. It's great to read a book quietly~ Let your heart calm, although this is not a book that can calm your heart. After reading this book, I went back to school once and met my university friends who had been apart for nearly a year... It was such a touch that made you know how to cherish the happiness in front of you. My friend said that we are not as good as we imagined. All we can do is to grasp the happiness in front of us. 
1	The facilities are outdated and I don't feel like it was renovated in 2005. The bathroom is also more general. But this is the case for Samsung. The bed is too short, I'm not very tall. Lie down a little, but my feet hang out of the bed. The bedside table has a small radio which is very distinctive, the business room has a computer, and the internet speed is also very good. I live in a corner room and I feel that the noise is not too loud. 
1	It must be said that the translator lacks passion! Compared with the Japanese version, the translated writing is as plain as water, and the plot develops like a dog looking for food in summer-listless. Books are still good books. The story is tasteful, and the meaning I want to express is clear. In general, this is a decadent version of Junichiro Tanizaki's work, showing the inferiority, dissatisfaction, and illusion of love. To make a choice is to end, and if you regret it, it is very bad. This book is suitable for girls who think before and after when making choices. 
1	The appearance of the Great Wall Hotel is spectacular. It is one of two four-star hotels in Jiayuguan. But it's too old. Advantages 1. 10 minutes walk from Xiongguan Square. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. 2. After all, it is a four-star hotel and the room facilities are quite complete. 3. The waiter sends two bottles of hot water to the room every day, plus a bottle of cold boiling water. It's warm. Disadvantages 1. The toilet paper is too rough: (2. The service center phone is often unanswered. However, the response speed after answering is still very fast 
0	The temperature of the power adapter is high, the touchpad is not sensitive, the left and right buttons are hard, and the weight is heavy (6-cell battery, you can’t have both fish and bear paws) 
0	This is the laziest hotel I have ever stayed in. . . dirty! Mess! difference! Not even the minimum two bottles of free mineral water are provided. . . I called the customer service and said that the cost was too high and it was cancelled. . Please don't live. . The toilet is blocked. . The towels are dirty. . The carpet is the dirtiest I have ever seen in my life. . Such a guest house is worse than a guest house of more than 100 yuan, and it is said to be 4 stars, which costs 380. . So wrong. . . Trust me. . Don't be fooled. . Additional comments October 14, 2007: The fifth floor is a nightclub, and the harassing call has never stopped 
0	The mini room is really a mini... The furniture and wallpaper are old, but they are all complete. Although the place is still hard to find, it is quite convenient to call a taxi. The room is very poorly soundproofed. In short, I'm sorry for the price, it's better to go to Home Inn. 
0	I think many books are better than this one. I bought it after seeing the ranking of the rankings. It has no content at all. The story is too nonsense and I don’t like it. 
1	The waiters are of high quality, better than many 5 star hotels in the country! The facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained and clean! The price of the catering is moderate! One night, the workers polished the floor and it was very noisy. After negotiations, the construction was stopped, and the lobby apologized and delivered on the second day 1 fruit plate, I apologized again at the front desk during checkout. I really didn't say anything about their service attitude, just one word: good! The snacks on the floor are very warm! The breakfast has Shandong characteristics, which is very good! A shortcoming: the room Soundproofing is a little worse! Additional comment July 22, 2008: Close to the trestle bridge, beautiful exterior scenery, worth staying! 
0	I bought it for a friend, and his kids would like it. The quality of the paper is worse than that seen in the bookstore, but the price is cheaper. I have to mention that after waiting for a long time, the speed of express delivery is really not that good. 
1	I have read almost all the medium and long works before the author. If I remember correctly, this work should be the first time the author has written completely in the first person. From the very beginning, I was deeply trapped by the author. I can’t extricate myself. Compared with the previous works, the writing style of this work is more mature and old, and the structure of the story is more ingenious and novel. Since Master Cai was pleased with his son some time ago, it is not difficult to find traces of his mood as a father and queen from the new work. The new mentality of life and the new perception of life, I believe this will be another successful work of transcendence by the author, and I look forward to the follow-up work soon! 
0	I was a new user who was fooled. It was the first time I bought a book in Dangdang, but it has been shipped on the 14th and has not received it until now. I am really disappointed. I don't know where to ask for the book! ! ! 
1	There is an advantage in cost performance, the overall quality is okay, and the screen has no dead pixels. The speakers are better than the D series. 
1	In my mind, A Dream of Red Mansions is undoubtedly the most classic and most intriguing book among the four masterpieces. . The more you read her carefully and profoundly, the more shock she can feel. . She is like a mysterious person with a veil, step by step to lure us into a wonderful world. . Perhaps it is because of her incompleteness that her beauty is revealed. . We have no way of knowing what kind of vigorous performance Mr. Cao will perform for us in the next forty episodes. . Therefore, there are so many scholars who have followed her, just to see her face. . This is a classic worth collecting! 
0	The hotel service is very poor, the equipment is average, the extra bed is a hardboard bed and the charge is high, the waiter's attitude is very poor, like no training, unskilled business, not like a three-star hotel. 
1	The hotel is great value. You don’t need 300 yuan to live in a standard room. The room is very clean and comfortable. 
1	"This book is very good, and the master’s brushwork is really extraordinary. However, I am very dissatisfied with the criticism of Confucius in the introduction. I don’t understand why I should fart Confucius at all when I talk about Laozi. Some of them are even guilty, such as ""sarcasm"" The philosophy of Confucius is not difficult. His respect for etiquette and long burial is better than encouraging his disciples to take up official posts in order to save the world. They are all sufficient materials for satirical articles.” (P3, third paragraph) is very unreasonable. There is such a sentence in the Analects, which I use to refute, ""Lin Fang asked about the foundation of rituals, and the son said: Da Zai asked, rituals are better than extravagance, but rather frugal. Funeral is not easy to be easy, and better. "
1	Many things can’t be finished in a few sentences, just like Alang’s abstract things, but not random and disorderly. Many details and paradoxes that I don’t usually pay attention to are found here. Alang’s book is too easy to let People get drunk, not because of how precious the paintings and how profound the words are, but because they include the weakness and hypocrisy of the urbanites, so that they make themselves lost, because every character inside is like I really felt myself, and then I listened to the music, closed the book, closed my eyes and enjoyed the loneliness and helplessness for a quarter 
1	For self-driving travel, this hotel is very suitable. We are staying on the top floor of Building 2. The scenery and services are very good. Next time we go to Weihai, we will stay at this hotel! 
0	I hope Dangdang can carefully check the quality of each book before shipping. Although I got the book in plastic and it is very new, I didn’t read a few pages and found that several pages were blank. The specific ones are pages 12-13, 16-17, and 20-21. , Pages 24-25, quickly checked the last few pages of the next book, and finally there is no defect. Hey, a very good book, it was ruined. 
0	"I ran up and down in China many times a year, and this hotel is the worst cost-effective hotel I have ever stayed in. 1. The service attitude is terrible, maybe they were too busy when I went, and they were too lazy to talk to you. 2. The room is bad, the room I live in is subsidized, I don't mind the Chinese building in the 1980s, but you can paint it with white paint. The walls of my room are in two colors and the ceiling is in three colors. Of course, it is not color matching, but a supplementary subsidy. 3. TV, actually uses an antenna~~ Yes, you read that right, they don’t have cable TV, let alone satellite TV. 4. The room was dirty, the toilet and basin in the bathroom churned, and mold grew on the edges of the floor. There are inexplicable ""liquids"" on the corners of the room 5, and the location is too far away, and there is a fight on the side of the exhibition hall. 6. Breakfast, forget it. 7. By the way, the entrance on the second floor is made of iron plates, which are full of covered bridges. Comrades, if you are going to the exhibition or staying at Jinjiang Inn or something else, you have to fight anyway. Hotel boss, sorry, you are so bad, by the way, my room number is 207. "
0	12 inches feels a little too small, so consider it if you have bad eyes. VISTA still feels like chicken ribs, it's a pity to eat tastelessly! 
1	In Baoding, it should be said that it is the best hotel, and the restaurants there give the hotel a lot of points. 
1	Some people think that if you eat everything in your daily life, you can eat just a little bit. You don’t need to make up. It’s okay to find pills. My opinion is that nowadays, what I eat in my stomach is only what looks like a certain kind of food. I don't dare to say whether there is real nutrition. Fertilizers, pesticides, genetically modified genes, clenbuterol, urea, contraceptives, and all the food in the market are very coquettish. And everyone is getting premature. There are wrinkles at the age of 20, and a heart at the age of 50 at 30. The hospital is getting more and more busy. For health, many of the antioxidant programs proposed in this book are very useful. 
0	The performance is a little worse than expected. When watching movies online, the fan keeps spinning, and it feels a bit difficult to run. 
0	I saw this book for the first time at the airport because I liked the packaging and everything, so I came to buy it and found it was not worth reading for my grandma who likes to read novels. She said that she couldn't stand it even if she talked about the things they had done at that time. 
1	Thin and light, the overall feeling is particularly smooth, and it feels very suitable for boys. It has edges and corners and looks very tough. It has many characteristic designs that make people love it. Especially at this price point, it is very cost-effective. 
0	I bought Du Lala’s promotion note and sent it to my friend. My friend said that I haven’t received it yet, and I feel dizzy. ! ! 
0	I was quite angry after reading this book. I have never seen such a shameless man! But for Zhang Ailing, this book is still worth buying 
0	If it is an XP system, it is even better. Jingdong is depressed that there is no price protection for the special Dongdong. 
1	"The book I wanted to read a long time ago finally got my wish today. I have been looking forward to it for so long, but I am always forgotten by time. Cheer for Wei Wei, because I am slightly sad, I am moved slightly. Looking at Weiwei's college life, I am very envious; thinking about the friendship between Weiwei and Ruan Ruan is very jealous; in fact, we also have the same. Weiwei is lucky to meet her favorite Chen Xiaozheng; Weiwei is also happy, marrying Lin Jing, whom she has always expected. Ups and downs, a novel worth reading. Last month, I watched ""Shanyue Don't Know What's in My Heart"", and it was also very good. The inside is Xiangyuan, and he has even ran here. Xinyiwu's works are very consistent. stand by! "
0	I bought this book in Dangdang at the end of 2008. I read it during the Spring Festival and found that the phenomenon of missing pages was very serious. Severely condemn Dangdang! Strongly demand a claim! 
0	It is very convenient and very affordable to buy a book online in Dangdang for the first time! As soon as the child receives the book, he will read it with love. It is a good set of books, in the happy children's story, let the child learn to be a character, caring and helpful child. 
0	I can’t activate Vista without a SLIC certificate. I wonder if you can solve it. There are fewer USB ports. The included content is small, except for a computer, a power supply, and a drive disk (only Vista is supported, and XP is not available). 
1	The hotel is relatively old, but the equipment is well maintained. The service is good and the surrounding area is more attentive. I came back at night and turned down and I felt very good. The mall downstairs is said to be the best in Jinan, I feel good~~` 
0	Booked two identical rooms, one with broadband and one without? why? There is a room with broadband, sometimes you can go online, sometimes you can't, so people are desperate! The roof of the bathroom is leaking, and there is no drink in the room. I asked the waiter for a drink. The answer was that I had to pay in cash, and I could not hang up the room account. Is that reasonable? 
1	"The surrounding environment is very good. Shopping and eating are also very convenient. (But there is no major brand store) The hotel service is good, but an episode happened when I checked in: I said that I didn't pay in advance, but fortunately, it was resolved smoothly! In addition, the front desk booked me through Ctrip, showing an expression of ""I don't know how to describe it"", and whispered: Ah, come from Ctrip&*@#@*.... (I can understand a little bit Cantonese) I wonder if other Ctrip members check into the hotel, did similar things happen? "
1	The environment is good, the air is fresh and quiet. It's a bit far from the city center, but the traffic conditions are good, suitable for city people with self-driving cars. The service is good. Miss Zhou from the sales department keeps asking questions. About a 5-minute walk away, there is a street in Chuancai Hexian in Taihu Lake. More than 20 restaurants are open until 10 o'clock in the evening. The fresh and cheap river is very famous in Huzhou. Stop at night 
1	The cost performance is good. The temperature control of the cooling base can be lowered by an average of about 12 degrees. If you don't run a large program, the heat is not large. The various interfaces are relatively complete. F2 enter the BIOS, change the mode under MAIN to the IDE interface, and then change the startup item to the CD-ROM drive, delete the pre-installed system to install XP, basically the GHOST version of the system cannot be installed, you can only install it with the installation disk . 
0	The beginning of the book is self-praising and mutual praise, the author is not true. All the books are clicked, which is actually boring. If you haven't bought it, it is not recommended to buy it. You can read Wang Changsong's health book and Ma Yueling's several books. They are better than this one. I have read them before comparing them. I hope everyone will not be confused by the flattery. 
0	The fever is amazing, especially in summer, like a fire board! You can save money on hand warmers in winter. Black is the fingerprint collector, ha 
1	Small size and easy to carry. The balance of performance is considered to be the best among products of the same price. There is no problem in running VISTA smoothly. 
0	As always, the heat dissipation is not good. Tongfang’s machine is like this, but it is still recommended to support domestic products. In addition, it is recommended that JD.com don’t send CD bags and send a heat sink. 
0	Very poor, I wanted to check out after I checked in for half an hour, the carpet was dirty, the bathtub was very disgusting, everything: hair, plaster, etc. Moreover, there was no swimming pool at all, and there was a problem with Ctrip’s promotion. I originally booked it for two days. I checked out one night. It happened that when I checked out, a buddy next to me had the same experience. He checked out and called Ctrip to book a hotel... I decided online~ 
0	The restaurant is very poor, and the level of dishes is not good. The hotel basically does not have tourist supporting services. In fact, there are many attractive tourist attractions in Henan, but there is a lack of corresponding services. 
0	The room is super rotten, looks very shabby and old, and there is a musty smell in the room that does not open the window for a long time. The quilt is also very uncomfortable, and it also has a smell. The pot of boiling water is super dirty and it is useless. , The room does not provide charged mineral water, only the person at the service desk can send it, but they said that they have to pay first, and then go out to buy it, what kind of hotel is this, in a word-bad! I advise everyone not to go! 
0	Install xp, the drive in the drive disk is incomplete. It needs to be offline, and the screen brightness cannot be adjusted, and the sound is OK. I don’t know if the driver is wrong 
0	This book is not for me, the whole book is not funny, and it doesn’t help memorize words at all, I still can’t remember 
1	The heat dissipation is very good, the fan sound is very small, the price is good, and I like the appearance of Xiaohei. Unexpectedly, snapping up and delivering it was so fast. 
1	"The cover is very cartoon, and the illustrations inside are also very beautiful, with a ki-mi style. For everyone who is a parent, this book is worth reading. The character written in the book summarizes each stage of the child's growth. I particularly like a sentence in the book: ""Because of our children, our memories of love will be retained, and our wisdom, dreams, and beliefs will also be passed on to the next generation."" Because of this sentence, all the hardships of parenting All can be happy. This book tells me the responsibilities and principles of being a parent. Only by doing well can I lead the next generation. After reading this book, I am more confident in being a good parent! "
0	Dizzy, I like it very much, five stars. . . How come you have become two stars. . . It still cannot be modified. . . 
1	The white case makes people feel bright, light weight and easy to carry, it runs well and has a long battery life, and it is very convenient to use. 
1	The room in the annex building is a bit old, it really needs to be refurbished, especially the carpet part, otherwise it is good overall. The breakfast service is still okay, still good. 
0	My baby is 2 years old and 3 months old. It is when he learns what he says. I have blocked this set of books. I will read it out when he understands what is good or bad. There are too many words that babies shouldn't learn. I am a set of disappointing books 
1	Perhaps for most people, such a book is really a headache, traditional characters, vertical typesetting, many quotes and comments. But if you really want to read and think deeply, you should read this book. Mr. Chen Guying’s comments are also very good. If you only buy general general education books, you may know the literal meaning, but it is difficult to understand why Zhuangzi writes this way, what is the purpose, and what are the benefits, even There are several definitions of a noun. Although the author explained his own clear explanations that are very reasonable and knowledgeable, the most important thing in reading is to think for yourself and walk into Zhuangzi himself 
1	From the time I got the book, I already knew that my baby would like it. From the color of the text and pictures, all children like it. I only read one book and found that what it embodied in this book is not only the knowledge of insects, but more importantly, a kind of affection. When the sand wasp was about to lay eggs, she really understood why her mother was not by her side when she was still a larva. It was all because of love to protect her safety. Children nowadays are too selfish. Read more books like this. Parents tell more about the metaphors in storytelling and give them some thoughts. 
0	After I bought it, I tested it after installing the system and found that the so-called graphics card switching independent button was broken and could not be switched at all. After inspection by ASUS, it was said that the button was broken and it was not covered by the national three-guarantee return. Let me consult with Jingdong. Hehe, JD.com has been covering up, pushing three and four, and then I thought about it, and sent it for repair for the bottom shell. 
1	I have already reviewed it, but I am still asked to evaluate it. What is this? Some features of Dangdang are particularly bad! Do I have to evaluate a few times when I buy it? I hope someone can handle this function, it is not human and intelligent at all! ! ! 
1	1. The most notable advantage is the long battery life; 2. The configuration is relatively complete: wireless, Bluetooth, and camera are necessary; 3. The workmanship is good, and the paint is more beautiful; 4. It is small and portable, just a magazine The size is enough to fit a normal schoolbag; five, the brand is okay, the information on the Internet is relatively complete; six, under normal circumstances, the sound of the hard disk and the fan is not too loud. 
1	"Some people say that love is the real beginning of life. Then first love must be the starting point of this journey. Some people say that first love is unforgettable. Because the first happiness is the sweetest memory; the first pain is the real heartache. Xiaoxian said: ""All first loves are ugly ducklings, and later loves are feathered swans."" This woman who still believes in love writes out the sweetness, bitterness, and helplessness of first love in a faint, but profound way. Touched my heart. I believe that every person who has gone through first love can find himself and see others in it. "
0	Too partial place, too deserted place, too bad breakfast. depressed! ! Additional comments April 18, 2008: Ctrip is recommended not to recommend the past 
0	The pre-installed vista is too rubbish, and the partition is too brain-dead. I went to the Shenzhen point to pick up the goods. At present, the Shenzhen point should speed up the construction progress, and hope to deliver it to Shenzhen as soon as possible. 
1	Lightweight, I thought that the x series should be lighter, but I didn't expect it to be so light. It's not a little lighter than the ASUS A8Js I used before. 
1	It's just a little bit older, some rooms have small windows and poor sound insulation, others are very good, after all, is it an old three-star! 
0	The environment of the special room is very bad. There is only a very small window leading to the hotel aisle, which is a bit like living in a basement. The sewer in the room still had an unpleasant smell. Please choose this hotel carefully. 
1	I bought it for the second time. It was translated by Zhou Kexi and Ike. I bought two copies each for a friend. 
0	The book is too small and I was disappointed when I took it in my hand. I thought it would be so exquisite~~~ It's really suitable for children to read, but it's not easy for very young children Not worth it 
0	Because I like this movie, I look forward to the original book more, but the pirated version of this book can't be added. I have been out of anger, so I don't bring such a deceitful person! 
1	The surrounding environment of the hotel is rather chaotic, and many hotels in Harbin have this problem. But the internal environment of the hotel is okay, the price is good, it is very close to the commercial center and the railway station, and the hotel takes the initiative to upgrade Ctrip guests for free, which feels good. The service staff are also warm and attentive and will stay at this hotel next time. 
1	The most difficult thing when I was a child was to be a child. ?? How many candies you eat, how many teeth you will lose. ?? Adults only believe what they see. Children only believe what they think. ?? Very sentimental sentences , As if seeing certain bits and pieces of my past, certain fragments of memories. Looking at my children now gradually growing, and then reading this book, maybe my requirements for children will not be so high. To be free I grow up and enjoy a truly happy childhood. After I grow up, I don’t feel that childhood memories are apart from review, exams are the scolding of adults, which is the direction I am working hard now. 
1	"Generally speaking, it's a bit old, it's a bit old 5 stars, that is, someone rang the doorbell less than 5 in the morning, and didn't sleep well after doing it. Hotel feedback May 7, 2008: Hebei Century Hotel is Shijiazhuang The first five-star hotel opened in 2000 and has been in operation for 8 years. The hotel is now undergoing hardware renovations to continuously improve its market competitiveness. At present, all the rooms on the ""Private Executive Floor"" have been renovated, and the hotel will continue to renovate and upgrade rooms on other floors. Hope you stay again! Hebei Century Hotel "
1	"Regardless of the content of the book or the layout of the content, the cover design of the book and the paper quality of the book are very much liked. The speed of express delivery is also very fast. I can enjoy the ""smile service"" of the courier every time. When the book is delivered, I can’t wait to open it. The outside of the book is wrapped with a thin white plastic film. I am very happy! Great value for money! At the same time, this ""San Zi Jing"" is also very suitable for collection! It is recommended to buy as soon as possible if you have not bought it yet and if you are still hesitant to buy it! (*^__^*) Hee hee... It seems to be playing free ads. Continue to support Dangdang in the future! Hope Dangdang will continue to develop! "
1	The hotel is not bad, the rooms are not big, but more comfortable. There are only Starbucks and KFC under the hotel, and it’s a bit far from the New World for dinner. 
0	Recommend not to stay! It is simply a hotel below 2 stars. There is no service at all. Only noisy human voices. The whole is a profitable hotel that hosts tourist conference teams. Eating in the morning is even more messy. Eating a meal is not peaceful. 
1	Anti-glare matte widescreen LCD display; good for commercial use, running CAD, 3dmax and other software faster; keyboard feels good. 
1	The MM at the front desk is very good, efficient and has a very good attitude. 
0	I stayed here for the first time. I had a colleague stayed there before, so I thought it should be okay. I didn’t expect: 1. The doorman was very uninitiated. Several doormen stood at the door chatting with the security guard, ignoring the guests and asking me to stand by myself. I stopped the car on the road. The damn thing is that after I stopped the car, the doorman actually ran from the door and said that he was helping the customer in front of the car. Seeing him lead the car to an old house, I was almost mad; 2 , The swimming pool is average, but the jacuzzi next to it looks very dirty, it can't be used, the dressing room is dirty. . . 3. There are very few options for delivery. When cleaning the room the next day, the used tableware is not taken away; 4. The Internet is very slow, and the network cable in my room is broken. It took a long time for someone to change it; 5. The room I lived in was on the back of the street. It was supposed to be a quiet place. It happened to be a large construction site at the back. It was in the middle of the night. There was a pile driver working hard at two o'clock in the evening. The hotel had almost no sound insulation. I slept with my ears covered both nights; 6. At 11:30 in the middle of the night, a waiter suddenly rang the doorbell and quickly put on his clothes to open the door, but said that he had pressed the wrong door. . . . . . . . . Crazy; 7. Speaking of the most hateful place, when I checked out, I forgot a headband and a packaged incense burner. Because I was on a plane, I called and said that I would go back a few days to get it. The next week, my colleague Get it for me, saying that the hair band and the orange were put together and it was broken? ? ? (It sounds disgusting) What about the incense burner? The hotel told my colleague that they would take the initiative to contact me. So far, a few weeks have passed and no one has looked for me! What kind of hotel is this! Every time I stay at the hotel, I always feel satisfied and dissatisfied, but Shenzhen Airlines is really disgusting to me this time. Looking back on it carefully, there are basically no hotels. Don’t stay. The price is not cheap. I have stayed in Shenzhen more than this cost-effective hotel, and the price of Ctrip is not cheap. It is said that many units have negotiated prices, which is not cost-effective to think about. Hotel feedback April 29, 2008: Dear customer: Hello! Thank you very much for your sincere criticisms and corrections during your stay on the improper service of the hotel. The hotel apologizes for the inconvenience and physical and mental discomfort caused by improper work of some employees. After the hotel leaders learned of your opinions the first time, they criticized and educate the parties concerned. The hotel sincerely invites you to visit the hotel again during your next visit to Shenzhen, and give us the opportunity to apologize in person. At the same time, the hotel also hopes that through its own continuous efforts, you can get your recognition again. 
1	Indeed, I did not finish reading in one breath, so, I said, I used two breaths. I rarely read a novel before watching a movie, this is the rare one. The novel is very true. Although the author said several times when he recalled that he could not remember what was happening at the time, I still remember how I felt when I read each page. When I read it by myself while crying, my husband again I started to laugh. Why did I cry for some reason? I really couldn't help it, and I was moved by the most real emotion. It is worth buying back for quiet reading on a weekend. It is a good book. 
0	I think this book is not suitable for friends who are in college or high school. I think it is not helpful to me when I am in college. It is only suitable for entry-level readers. 
1	I bought this set of books, the pictures inside are black and white, and a little bit shallow, but the lines of the pictures are more beautiful. I took this book with my son when I was on vacation. I read it together on a swing under two big willow trees on the beautiful Qiong Sea. My son and I took it for the boy, dog, and frog in the book. Nice name, then look at the picture beautifully and imagine happily finishing the story in the book. My son is very happy because we made up the story ourselves and we all like it. A good set of books can give you unlimited imagination and unlimited fun. 
0	Bad and bad that makes you desperate and can't choose. Lack of competition 
0	I think buying this book is totally equivalent to dropping the money in the gutter, which is not worth it. I advise everyone not to buy it. I will regret it, like me. Not as good as other books. 
1	"I have read the book [[China Not Happy]] several times in a row recently. Whether it is Song Xiaojun, Wang Xiaodong, Huang Jisu, Song Qiang, Liu Yang, their articles point directly to current malpractices, or laugh and ridicule. There is a bit of patriotism and the voice of the angry youth who is despised by the so-called ""elites"". It really has a refreshing and refreshing feeling. I hope that the senior leaders can listen to the voices of the young people and stop being misled by the so-called people In the interests of China, the ""elite"" is swayed, stand upright, speak out loudly what you want to say, and do what you want to do bravely. "
1	"""In dreams, our daytime work and leisure, joy and pain are never repeated. On the contrary, the only purpose of dreams is to free us from them, although sometimes our minds are filled with things, or we suffer from suffering. Torture, or our energies are all devoted to something of concern, dreams also enter our minds in a symbolic way.""? The dreamer is taken away from the conscious world in the dream; in the dream, those The orderly content and normal behavior we remembered in our waking state are gone. ""Do you wish you were in a dream? A good book, a book to read slowly! "
1	I bought it for my colleague and it was not bad. You get what you pay for! This configuration is worth the price! 
1	Too much, not to go into details one by one, mainly because the price is reasonable. The T4200 feels much better than the Kourou 2 1.8 clock I used before. I don’t feel slow before I load anything. Orders placed on the evening of the 30th will be shipped in the morning on May 1st and will be picked up in the afternoon. The high efficiency is what I should praise most! 
1	The lobby is not very good, but the room is very comfortable. The most satisfying place is the hotel's lobby assistant and customer service staff, who can timely and do their best to complete the customer's requirements. It makes people feel at home. Take this to thank them. 
1	It came the next day after placing the order, praise! Better than expected, a good netbook, fortunately, the configuration is a six-cell battery, which is good enough. 
0	It took a few days to find out that the second half of the book was printed with serious errors. There were more than forty pages inverted. I was a VIP in Dangdang. I discovered this for the first time, and the inverted part was still missing pages. Such a serious printing error, how do you inspect the goods when they are in the warehouse? How are the goods inspected when they leave the warehouse? I have applied for return for so many days, and there is no response. If you do not return this week, continue to complain. Feeling dizzy. Also, the content of this book is out of space, just a superficial exchange. Crazy doesn't like it. 
1	Eddie is an ordinary amusement park maintenance worker, but an accident lost his life in order to save a little girl. When he ascended to heaven (actually not heaven, but the place he has been to in his life) ), I met five people in different places. Some of them didn't even know me, but they were more or less connected with myself. From these people he discovered many secrets in his life and the meaning of this life... .... At the same time, I also admire the author's writing skills. Changing from time to time will not make the article upsetting and complicated~ It is a book that baptizes the soul! 
0	The price is reduced after the purchase, depressed, a bit heavy, reinstall the system, it is a pity that the pre-installed items in the original machine are lost! 
1	The books are more beautiful and suitable for girls. The keyboard is super large, it will be relatively convenient to use. After installing the xp system, there is no situation that netizens say that the driver is not installed 
1	"This is the first time I have stayed in this hotel. Due to the flight at night and the temperature difference in the weather, I have some colds and diarrhea. My heart is also a bit bad. I am worried. This matter was discovered by the housekeeping manager. Came to condolences and presented fruit. At 12:30 in the morning, the manager on duty also notified the manager of the western restaurant to prepare porridge and side dishes for me, and asked about my physical condition. At that time, I was really touched by the concern of the hotel staff. I didn't expect that there would be ""family care"" when traveling on business. Since I am on a business trip, I used it as a tourist by the way. This hotel is located in the city center and the transportation is very convenient. I bought a map myself. The waiter helped me to mark out all the scenic spots I wanted to visit, and introduced some famous ones accordingly. The scenic spots have saved me time and added a good mood for my own travel. I was in a hurry on a business trip and forgot to bring a charger. After learning about it, the housekeeping manager helped me find the corresponding charger for my mobile phone. In short, I was very moved and had a great time during this business trip. If I come to Xiamen next time, I will definitely choose Hongdu Hotel without hesitation. "
0	This book is very popular. Although I don’t like reading books in this area, I can’t help but buy a copy after seeing so many reviews that recommend reading it 
1	The price and gifts of this machine are invincible, and the notebook is very light. Powerful function! Hope that Jingdong will withdraw from such activities in the future! 
1	It's very light and easy to carry, and it's great in all aspects. The quality of the gift is also very good. I used 2000-100 coupons to start with 6699. Although there is no 5000-200 coupons, the price is not bad. 
0	Why did I order this book. I didn’t receive it when I delivered it? I ordered 2 copies in total. I didn’t receive this book. Why? 
0	I haven't read Teacher Bi's book before, because I am more interested in psychology, so I chose this book first. After reading it, I was disappointed and I was not interested in buying her other books. I think this book is not well written. Is the growth of a psychologist so simple? Is it really possible to have any level, as long as there is a heart? After reading it, do you dare to go to these so-called Chinese psychologists? Honestly I dare not! 
0	There is no advantage in price because nothing is delivered. After buying it by yourself, it is similar to buying it in the Computer City. However, you can choose your own mouse or bag. Then there are so many good things for you to encounter. 
1	The hotel is very close to Baoguo Temple and the station; the rooms are clean and tidy; the yoga hot spring is one of the four major hot springs in Emei, and the hotel guests only need 50 yuan per person. The price is relatively high; the breakfast is very rich; the only drawback is the comparison of the corridors in Building 1. Complex, like a small maze, it took a while to find a room. 
0	Hu is just showing off the words. Although the description is extraordinary, I always feel that there is no chapter. Zhang Mishang can take a look. Identification is completed. 
0	Two USBs are generally enough. I only use two of my four. Haha, if the price is lower, it would be nice. Haha, tap it again and aim at the netbook. without MIC. 
1	My little niece is 8 years old, and she likes to read, just like when I was a child, so how could I not satisfy her little and beautiful wish! She has read a book of Yang Hongying’s Laughing Cat series, which seems to be related to some cat’s ears. She began to dream about having a full set every day. It seems Laughing Cat is really attractive! But my son is not very interested, maybe Yang Hongying's book is more suitable for girls. I can already imagine how my little niece enjoys getting the book, hehe, giving someone a good book, there is a fragrance in my hand, I am also happy~~ 
0	I made a reservation a week ago, but after arriving at the hotel, I was told that I did not receive Ctrip’s notice. After everyone negotiated for the whole night, we finally solved the accommodation problem by ourselves. I think it was because there were more people going there. The hotel just refused to give us rooms so that they could sell them too expensively. Ctrip's service was particularly slow throughout the process. The rooms in this hotel are also very poor. 
0	The system was difficult. It took a day to install xp, and then install it as Vista, because there is not much need to play games 
1	"This is a good book worth reading. Basically in line with my reading expectations. In nature, every existence that exists needs to live with dignity and freedom. How to achieve a delicate balance among various existing lives is the eternal pursuit of all lives. For human beings known as the ""spirit of all things"", it is a huge test and proposition. People can be masters, and this must be for themselves. But it is disgraceful to step into the scope of not belonging to oneself. People who like this book will recommend Jack London's ""Call of the Wild"" to you. More enjoyable! "
0	Advantages: 1. The bed is very comfortable and moderate in hardness. 2. The room is relatively clean. 3. The landscape can be. 4. Convenient area, with supermarkets and restaurants nearby. Disadvantages: 1. The room is too small and the aisle is less than 80cm. 2. The bathroom and toilet are smelly and unbearable. It is estimated that the drainage channel is not well done, and it smells like a bog. 3. The front desk service was average, I was not allowed to collect credit card in advance, and I was asked to check out in one go, which was very strange. 4. The decoration is too simple and cost-effective. This hotel should be within 300 yuan. Generally speaking, if it were not for the convenience of going to Peking University, I would not stay in this hotel again. 
0	The price of this book is too expensive, and it is not suitable for children over 5 years old. The pages are too few and expensive to buy! It's not worth buying. 
1	I snapped it up at 3999, so lucky. What else is there for the price? The brand and price are very good 
0	During the 5 days of staying, I used the sauna every day. The air-conditioning effect was extremely bad. Every day, customers called to question the waiter. I often heard other customers complain in the room. I would not choose this if it weren’t for the business trip. In a hotel, the waiter is not clear about the facilities of his hotel. I called to ask if there is a refrigerator. The first time I said yes, the second time I said no. Complaints will not be processed! I hope everyone has lessons learned, don't be fooled, stay in this hotel! Hotel feedback July 7, 2008: Dear guest, hello! First of all, thank you for your valuable comments to our hotel, and at the same time apologize for the discomfort you felt during your stay. Three Gorges Dongshan Hotel is a three-star hotel, selected as a green hotel (Silver Leaf Class) by Yichang Tourism Bureau in 2007. As a hotel operating with the concept of energy conservation and environmental protection, the hotel has always regarded energy conservation and environmental protection as a responsibility to the society. For many years, the hotel has always responded to the national environmental protection requirements, strictly in accordance with: the indoor temperature in summer is not less than 25 degrees, and the indoor temperature in winter is not higher than 20 degrees to control the room temperature, because the hotel is equipped with an environmental protection advocacy card in the guest room in advance, and self-activities Since its launch, this initiative has been understood and supported by most of the in-house guests. However, due to individual differences, some guests have different requirements for air-conditioning temperature, which also causes the hotel to have conflicts in energy conservation and customer service. The hotel will make preparations more carefully in the future work. While advocating guests to support the hotel’s environmental protection actions, it will try its best to meet the needs of different guests and continuously improve our services. 
0	Bluetooth just can't start, I don't know how to do it. The control panel below is not very useful. The small screen is still adapting. 
1	After this set of books, we bought a lot of books. Basically, the ones that were well received on the Internet and the popular ones were bought back, but the children's favorite is this set of Beibei bears, so do I, I think all the books have My own is good, but for children, Beibei bears are the best. 
1	The quality and service of acer are very good, and this product is very good value. The look is also pretty, and the basic performance can handle it as long as you don't play big games. 
1	I chose this hotel after reading reviews, and it did not disappoint. Every hotel staff serves the guests sincerely, which is second to none in China. For example, we are looking for a supermarket in a hotel. Instead of telling you where you are with a finger, they will show you the way. The air conditioner is a bit cold when dining in the restaurant of the hotel. I took out the shawl, but the waiter delivered it immediately A bowl of ginger soup, blowing the sea breeze a bit cold, they found out when they went to the restaurant for breakfast, and delivered cold granules and ginger soup. We are very moved. The design and facilities of the hotel rooms are very good, and small gifts are carefully prepared every day. It is a rare and generous hotel. The only thing that I think needs to be improved is the training of hotel staff to understand the distinctive scenic spots and restaurants in Qingdao (of course this is difficult for any other hotel to do), because there is really nothing else to suggest :) Additional comments August 1, 2008: I suggest you not to go to Qingdao Underwater World, the Polar World very close to the Sea View Garden is very fun, and I will be very disappointed if I have been to the polar region and then go to the seabed:) 
1	I just came back from Wuxi and stayed in the second building of the hotel at 328YUAN. The overall feeling is as follows; the room is clean, well-equipped and has a liquid mirror computer; the food is delicious and not very expensive; the most commendable is the service level, the husband carelessly used the phone It was dropped, and the staff sent it back immediately after picking it up, like it! The hotel staff almost greeted them with smiles, which is rare. This alone indirectly improves the reason for staying in the hotel! 
0	When my husband checked in on 8/29, the cashier staff could use the pre-authorized 800 yuan when checking in to swipe the card as a consumption to swipe the credit card for the guest. He also planned to tear off a voucher. I didn't notice it at the time, but fortunately all three vouchers I came back. 9/5. After discovering the problem, my husband called the cashier of the hotel. No one responded on 9/7 now. The quality and service are not ordinary. Fortunately, I found a credit card bank at Followed up, I really don’t know what will happen to the 800 yuan. Additional comment September 7, 2007: When I left the hotel to check out, I said that the original pre-authorized (actually for consumption) card could not be used, so I had to provide another card. My husband didn't know the credit card, so he used another card to check out and left. I thought about it, would it be a game? If I'm not careful, I don't know whom to contribute 800 yuan to? 
1	The appearance is dazzling, very beautiful, it is comfortable to look at and use it, I can't put it down...The floating button feels good, and the price is very high. Compared with other brands of notebooks, nothing needs to be said, highly recommended! 
1	The room was clean and comfortable, but the bed was a bit hard. However, the claim to be the most beautiful section in Haihe is purely a lie. It takes at least ten minutes to walk away from Haihe, and it is not beautiful at all. 
0	1. The thickness of the machine is not well controlled, and it is too thick. 2. The heat dissipation is general, especially the power adapter is relatively hot, which makes people feel unsafe. 3. With the built-in linux system, I want to install XP and format the hard disk. I still have some symptoms, and the shutdown is very slow. 
1	It looks good, I prefer the black notebooks, so I am very satisfied with them! In addition, the overall feel of the books is very strong! 
0	The advantage is the location, a 10-minute walk to the Bund and Nanjing Road. The room is relatively small, and the floor is low, which is a bit depressing. The bathroom towels may be sterile, but they are very old and yellow in color. There is no way. I used my own towels. The service staff are not very enthusiastic. The girls who check in are okay. The waiter in front of the lobby basically doesn't look at me when asking for directions or answering questions. It exercises my temper and is good for self-cultivation. 
0	Bad and bad that makes you desperate and can't choose. Lack of competition 
0	The mold is not fine, and the plastic cover where the hard disk is placed is always crunching. It just so happens that there is another stepping foot. Very upset. I put a piece of paper in it to get it done. 
0	Although it is not far from the train station and walks on the right road for 10 to 15 minutes, the location is not easy to find. If you don't take a taxi, you have to ask two or three people. When I called the hotel to ask for directions, I found that the receptionist was not quite sure about how to get there. The location is rather off, but you will be woken up by the car in the morning when you live on the ninth floor, perhaps just because the local driver is used to honking the horn. The room is relatively large, but the carpet is stained, which does not match the two and a half stars. There is a small food stall downstairs at night, which is very convenient. 
1	Lightweight, 2G RAM Vista speed is not bad, temperature control is indeed much better than other brands! The workmanship is very good. 
0	I wanted to read some psychological books or stories, so I bought this book, but the plot in it was bizarre, and I felt that I was even more abnormal. The ending is even more neurotic~~The teacher actually needs to sleep with her teacher in order to be treated~~How can there be such a thing, I look sick~~In the end, I feel that I wasted my time and I was disappointed. 
0	INTEL South Bridge is ICH9. Actually, it is not insufficient, but tells you to install XP to find a disk with ICH9 driver. 
0	1. The waiter at the entrance of the hotel was indifferent to the luggage carried by the guests. 2. When we told the front desk to book through Ctrip, the two waitresses were expressionless and said the fax was off work. We didn’t know. Later, we called Ctrip by ourselves. During the coordination period between Ctrip and the front desk, they refused to let us check in first. 3. We got up for breakfast the next morning. When we were two minutes away from entering at 9 o'clock, we had already packed a drop of soup. Nothing left, we asked the service staff, they looked up at us, and there was no response at all. 4. It was snowing on the two days when we arrived, and the hotel lobby stated that there were military coats for rent. We wanted to rent clothes, and asked the front desk, but they owed them again. The expression of 300 taels of silver, said 200 deposit, we kindly asked if we could look at the clothes, they threw it over, there was no key, and it was locked. I was really surprised that I asked me to pay the deposit. 5. Objectively speaking, It may not be the hotel’s fault, but the management is really bad. Our two rooms were knocked on the door three or four times in the middle of the night and in the early morning. We had a bit of altitude sickness at first, and we suffered even more. 6. The hot water in the room is cold and hot, and all the people who take a bath are cold. All in all, we booked the Jiantang Hotel at that time. It was because of a temporary power outage that we changed the hotel. The service of the two hotels was very different. We left early the next morning. This hotel gave me a bad impression. Never go again. Additional comment November 16, 2007: I would like to add that there is snow on our car. I asked the hotel to borrow a mop to clean it. I was very arrogant and refused to borrow it! 
0	I just turned a few pages and found that it was not authentic English or American. After all, it was written by Koreans. It's ridiculous to think about myself. If I want to learn English, I don't want to buy British and American works. Instead, I go to Korean works. Now only when the garbage is thrown away, money is wasted. 
0	The service is average, the price is relatively high, the rooms are not satisfactory, smelly and dirty... The worst thing is that the waiters are not trained, have no sense of service at all, and have a bad attitude! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	excellent service. Meals are served 24 hours. We arrived at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the evening and provided dinner specifically for us, which was very moved and the price was relatively affordable. The only thing that was not enough was that the check-in procedures in Building 1 and Building 2 were handled separately. We first drove to the hotel lobby and were told that this was Building 2 and we had to go to Building 1. But Ctrip did not tell which building it was when booking. 
0	The content of the book is good, but the reprint printing is not as good as before. I bought a set at Xinhua Bookstore before, and then I gave it to someone. I heard that Dangdang will have a discount, so I ordered another set. I found that the version supported by Dangdang.com’s marketing is obviously not high in print quality, low in image definition, and paper. Not as good as the version sold in the bookstore, I don’t know why? Is the price discounted and the quality discounted too? 
0	The installation system is not easy to install, and I did not install it after a whole afternoon without recognizing gost. Finally, I asked the company's network administrator to help install it. Why did the bags I gave had a strong smell of rags? . Use some perfume before you use it. . . 
1	The hotel environment is very good and the traffic is very convenient. There are more places to eat nearby. I arrived at night at more than 12 o'clock. It is very convenient to eat nearby. 
0	Broken stuff, the writing is really bad. I don't understand why so many people give it 5 stars. Have you ever worked? 
0	Knowledge is interspersed in the story, and it is very interesting, so that while listening to the story, children can learn a lot of knowledge, a very good set of books. 
0	The new hard disk has bad sectors? ? ? Did I order the back or something? ? ? ? Deviation of heat dissipation effect! 
1	The price/performance ratio is quite high, and the configuration is very balanced, especially the 3470 graphics card, which is very attractive. Basically, no major upgrades are needed. Personally think that 2G of memory is enough. And this is a discrete graphics card, so it won't take up system memory for video memory. 
1	Unintentionally inserting willows into the shadows, there are many things that you can't help but you have to accept your destiny. Even though it is not your own medical will in the end you have to accept it, this is a person's fate. Why Zhen Huan was selected into the palace is not just her wit. After reading the next few books, I discovered that Zhen Huan was selected into the palace because Zhen Huan looked like the late queen. What a humiliation for a person. It's not myself, but the shadow of others. I only know this feeling after reading the next few books. This is how Zhen Huan's life was doomed. 
0	The author doesn't understand the fart himself, and writes something terribly false to deceive everyone's attention. Alas, it damages the image of Chinese medicine. I suggest you not to buy it. I feel quite fooled after buying it. 
0	"1) The screen is ""mirror"", contrary to the customer's previous answer (I personally like the matte surface, the mirror is too dazzling)! 2) The sound of the fan is much louder than expected! 3) Linux changes to WinXP, blue screen, need to modify BIOS settings (hard disk parameters changed to IDE mode) "
0	The heat dissipation is not good, mainly at the left palm rest and the mouse touchpad. It becomes a little hot after about 20 minutes after booting, which is really terrible~ I don't know if it is a quality problem. . . The hard drive often makes a clicking sound, I don't know if it is normal. . . 
1	Because the frequency of reading this set of books is too high, I am very worried that I will not buy this set of books again. Although she popularizes scientific knowledge, it also monopolizes her reading hobby. Holding a lot of this set of books every day, reading and reading. I have seen someone comment on comic books in this way, saying that comic books are desserts. All children like comic books, just like their favorite desserts, but eating only desserts will affect the growth of children. I have bought 20 copies of this set of books, so I won't buy it anymore. I think one or two books are worth owning, but there is no need to buy them in large quantities like mine. 
0	The use of cpu is relatively large, and I don’t know the life span? The ASUS logo in the middle of the display is very hot, I don't know if it has a point or a disadvantage. Mainly when the logo was posted, it was very bad. 
0	Did you make a mistake, it dropped 111 after only 2 days? Also send anti-virus (although it is garbage anti-soft)? 
0	Compared to Acer, which was selling together at this time, it felt a big loss. The price drop is nothing compared to the gifts. 
1	This book is very good, especially for a general understanding of the history of the Ming Dynasty. Regardless of the length of time, you can see it in your hand, which is more attractive. I think if the author can dig a little deeper, make narratives richer and more profound, and quote some original texts in parentheses, it may make young people have a deeper understanding of the complexity of politics, officialdom, and interpersonal relations. Knowing, even for learning classical Chinese, will have great benefits. I look forward to the revised edition of the author to be more attractive! The color of the printed characters is too light, which makes your eyes tired if you look at it! 
0	Just like the introduction of this book, it is a book that parents don't like. The protagonist in the book is designed to be ugly, and the child cried when he saw it. The content is very simple. A dozen or so pages are all behaviors that parents don't let their children do. I don't know if older children will learn David's way or can learn from it instead of doing it. 
1	"After reading ""Border Town"" in one breath, although the length is not long and the story is simple, the content is short and precise, and then I think of Schopenhauer's words: ""The best placebo for human beings is to know that your pain is not special. Many, many people, even many outstanding people, endure the same pain and misfortune like you, endure this life full of nothingness. ""The pain experienced by people has existed in the past, in the present, and in the future. The difference is only the carrier. . The care and love of our parents for our children and grandchildren will always exceed our imagination. What they endure is the pain we attach to and they are willing to endure without hesitation. "
0	The laptop bag, mouse and screen protector are not equipped. There is the heat sink of the notebook on the right. The mouse in the right hand will be hot for a long time. The USB port distance is too close and the sockets are too few. Too bad,? XP too?, 
1	The configuration is balanced, the appearance is beautiful, and the workmanship is good. The installation of XP SP3 system with the self-made CDROM boot disk of the u disk was completed in 1 hour, very smooth. OK! I am very satisfied. 
1	"To be honest, compared to Zhang Ailing’s original work, I prefer the TV series version of ""Love in the Fallen City"". Because it described the story that was only a dozen pages in the original work more detailed and profound, and added some new plots on the basis of not affecting the original story content, shaping Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyuan more in line with the original. Our concept makes us more acceptable. Compared with the selfish love story in the original work, I believe everyone will prefer to watch the warm love story in the TV series version. So it is recommended that friends who like it buy it. "
0	The picture is too messy, I don’t understand the key points. It’s hard to get the child to concentrate when telling a story. 
1	The price is good, obviously. Those who can't install xp look at what I said. Go to bios to modify ahci to ide and then find an installed version of xp, go in and directly delete all partitions and then re-partition and install. Find a ghost xp, go in and use ghost's partition function to partition and install directly. If you insist on ahci, find a driver for ahci-ide, install this driver after installation, you can switch to ahci. 
1	The hotel is an Air China hotel, you can accumulate Air China mileage. This is better. There are many types in the morning, it is recommended 
1	The environment of the hotel is okay, it is close to the bus station and convenient for travel. The average waiter is very kind and will take the initiative to greet you, but never greets you like a manager. What is more depressing is that one day the waiter took away a bottle of beverages from the refrigerator that was about to expire, and did not hand over clearly. The next shift staff misunderstood that we drank it. I also booked a room for 4 days, but the room card was stopped in the morning of the third day, so when I returned from the beach, I had to go to the lobby to reapply. When the breakfast went late, I felt that their table was being cleaned very slowly, as if the waiters were not enough. Looking at nearly 7 or 8 tables where no one was sitting, there were a stack of plates waiting to be cleaned. There was no way to tell the waiter that it was a long time later. Come to clean up 
1	The LED screen is very thin, the appearance is good, and the configuration meets the mainstream applications. 
0	The price is too expensive, the room is still too small, sometimes the air conditioner is not turned on, and the toilet in the room is broken 
1	Yes, it has become a resident hotel in Beijing, but the restaurant is too expensive 
0	"The Regent who lived this time was really annoying. There is no non-slip mat in the hotel bathroom, and a towel is spread on the floor to shower. However, the towel is too small and it still falls. Three teeth were lost. Includes two front teeth, one of which needs to be extracted. What happened after that made me even more disappointed in this so-called local four-star hotel. No one in the hotel has an apology since the incident happened. On the contrary, you are not careful and refuse to make any sincere and reasonable compensation. Ctrip's communication is also disappointing. The phrase ""no way"" is nothing more. I hope friends who plan to stay in this hotel will pay attention. Your own safety is still very important. "
1	After this set of books arrived, I looked through them one by one. Then take one copy back every day to show her baby girl. What I like is also what she likes. Carmela said that there must be something more interesting in this world than laying eggs. Camelido said that there must be something more interesting in this world than sleeping. After we study and work day after day, such fairy tale books give us new dreams and new experiences in life. There are always bright spots in life, but first of all, we must have a childish mind. 
1	The price is very good. There was a promotion a month ago. The total cost was 4,430, and now it is 4,800, which is a little lucky. Ha ha 
1	"The first time I raised a cat, the first cat book, it resonates very well, and I have mixed feelings. The thin one hundred and thirty-seven pages describe the tangible and intangible love between cats and people. The book says: ""Since ancient Egypt, two kinds of people have been distinguished: those who love cats and those who can't stand cats."" All kinds of cat lovers in the book look cute and a bit funny, all of which reflect their right Cats love these little things more than themselves. But others won't tell cat lovers how crazy they are for cats, because they are waiting to see the sweet comedy. Love cats, love every day. "
1	High-quality Dolby sound effects. Using Lenovo’s new high-touch keyboard, the new keyboard has been humanized updates in terms of layout, keycap shape, and keystroke feel, which not only meets the requirements of fast input speed and input accuracy, but also meets the comfort of user input Demand. Humanized one-key mute design. The key is good heat dissipation, workmanship, and design, which is very suitable for home entertainment. 4099 grabbed it. A relatively cost-effective machine. 
1	Stayed a few times and it feels okay. But this time I couldn't fall asleep in the cold at night. Put on sweaters and trousers, covered with 3 quilts, exaggerated? There is also hot air in the air conditioner, but the room temperature is low and it is not very cold outside. I really don't understand. Changed a room, still the same. Had to check out! 
0	Because of the difference in cultural background, I feel that this book is more suitable for Western children! The content of the story emphasizes individuality! More self! Although we can treat it more rationally, it is not easy for children to understand. 
0	The built-in red flag system is super trash, making people unable to start, and finally modified XP, GHOST version is not enough, you must use the installation version, depressed 
0	I live in the so-called executive room on the fifth floor. Although it is a smoke-free floor, 　 but the smell of smoke was smelled as soon as the elevator exited. The room size and equipment are average. The bathroom design is strange. There is a shower head outside the bathtub, 　but only half of the glass door blocks the water spray, 　so you must take a shower very carefully to prevent water from wetting the floor outside the glass door. There are obvious stains on the outside of the bathtub near the floor. Executive room guests can have breakfast in the so-called executive lounge on the 6th floor. There are very few food styles, 　looks very unattractive, 　no loss if you don’t eat. With the above facilities, the room rate is $1,027.- This is the worst hotel I have paid more than 1,000 yuan to stay in Shenzhen. I will never stay again. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, relatively light, and it is already very good to buy a notebook with this kind of performance and configuration at this price. 
1	The Tomb Raider series has always had an obscure attraction to me. Therefore, the tomb-raising notes that have always been well-known are my second set of related novels of choice. Because there are too many plagiarisms on the market. The best part of this novel is that it should be the layout of chapters, at least not a story, every time the end of the book is always drawn to another thing, people can't help but guess and feel like waiting. . If the reader's feeling for the new book either erupts in anticipation or dies out in anticipation, I look forward to the next development of this set of books. 
0	1. The location of the air outlet, but it has been known for a long time, and does not hinder the use; 2. Without a system, it is best to prepare the relevant drive in advance. 
0	The service quality of the hotel staff needs to be improved, which is obviously not proportional to the room rate. The room I stayed in has blood stains on the sheets. The service staff actually evaded that the blood stains are wet. The implication is that we got it up by ourselves, in the standard room. There is no refrigerator and bathrobe, the service staff said that because the room was booked from Ctrip, it was cheap, so don’t worry about it. The water was suddenly cut off at night, and the service staff said that we used 2 hot water machines to boil the water. But the hot spring area The attitude of the service staff is very good, and the attitude of the hotel staff is very different. It is recommended that members only go to the hot springs instead of staying in the hotel. Breakfast is OK, mainly Chinese food 
1	Thank you very much to the customer service staff of Ctrip's service number 84392 for helping to properly solve the mistakes guaranteed by the guest's own credit card, and the incidents that were not notified in time. I will visit this hotel again next time I have a chance to support Ctrip 
0	The power supply is actually two-phase, it looks insecure, the keyboard design is very old-fashioned, not good-looking, the XP system can not use ghost, you have to drive it yourself. 
0	The picture shows that it is close to the railway station and cannot be too demanding. But even if you live again, you must live in a new building. The old building seems to belong to the category of cultural relics, built during the Puppet Manchukuo? The whole is gloomy, the corridors are tortuous, the rooms are small, the service is poor, and there are harassing calls. 
0	1. Outside the room is the sound of the central air-conditioning unit. I can’t sleep 2. The hotel attendants seem to show that others owe her money, but they are very enthusiastic to those little Japan. 3. The breakfast offered by the hotel is small. , But the sanitation is very unclean. Those dishes and chopsticks are not washed at all. Four. Such hotels will no longer be free. 
0	It is more than 80 more expensive than Xino~~100 more expensive than yixun~~~ but I trust Jingdong~~~ and there are self-pickups in Tianjin~~It’s not good to be expensive~~ 
0	There is no system installed, it is too complicated. XP is installed, but the problem of the SATA hard disk has not been solved yet, so I can only use the compatibility mode 
1	1. The shell is crystal clear, and those who pay attention to the shape can choose; 2. The graphics card is a mid-range card, and there is basically no problem in general 3D games; 3. The heat dissipation effect is very good; 4. The five usb ports are convenient for connection; 5. The sound effect It's really good. 
1	The same rooms are small and large, and the location is relatively remote. Breakfast is not in the form of a buffet, but in the form of a set meal. If you can’t choose it yourself, you have to buy it yourself. This is very inconvenient, I don't like it very much. Hotel feedback April 7, 2008: Thank you very much for visiting our hotel, and thank you for your attention to our hotel and asking some questions. The size of the same hotel room is the same. Regarding the same room, there are small and large problems. It is the situation that our hotel gives guests a free upgrade to stay in order to guarantee the reservation of the guest’s room when the original room type is insufficient or abnormal. The hotel’s breakfast is a set meal. There are 8 fixed Chinese refreshment packages for guests to choose In addition to the package, other snacks need to be added. Guests need to purchase their own. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you! Welcome to our hotel again! 
0	I’ve had some trouble installing the phone, but I’m fine now, but the keyboard of the phone doesn’t seem to work. 
0	The memory is only 1G, Vista is too slow. I want to switch to xp, but some people on the Internet say that they have to download various sound card and graphics drivers. It is troublesome. I want to add a memory stick. I don’t know what is suitable and who Know? Could you recommend it? 
0	"This ""The Analects of Confucius"" was too popular and shallow. I finished reading it in one hour and gave it away quickly. I felt sorry for my money when others thought it was good "
1	Simple and generous, the configuration is good, but I bought it at 5399. I saw a message saying that 4299 was snapped up, and I felt a little unbalanced. 
1	The appearance is quite satisfactory, the overall performance is not bad, I bought it for the NBA version, but it is easy to leave fingerprints. The sound effects are not bad. 
0	Why is this book not marked as out of stock when I paid for the book, but it is said to be out of stock after payment, and it is still out of stock nearly two weeks after payment? Is there a credit problem? 
1	This book has its limitations, because different national conditions have different backgrounds, and the author cannot be called a parenting expert. Many of them are based on their own experience and lack scientific and rigorous arguments. But for ordinary parents, it can still play a role of enlightenment, guidance and even enlightenment. Especially many parents in China at present, because they lacked family education when they were young, they are unable to start or care when they have to take on the heavy responsibility of family education. This book will tell parents that loving children and valuing children’s education is every Parents are gifted and must fulfill their rights and duties. 
1	The location is good, the environment is good, the room is large, but the breakfast is not as good as it used to be, and the overall feeling is good. Special emphasis, good service! 
0	I bought it because of its reputation. I transferred it to others because of its reputation. Except as a gift, it has no value to me. All the characteristics of men and women and the solution of family problems described in the article are empty to me. There is no value to refer to, nor can it resonate. . . . . . . 
0	I bought it for my niece because I saw that the sales volume was very good. I didn’t know that it was my IQ problem. Anyway, I didn’t understand any foreign novels, let alone my niece’s... 
0	The screen is slightly smaller, and the size of the case should be enough to support a larger screen. The A side is beautiful, but it is easy to get fingerprints. Fortunately, a piece of wiping cloth was provided. 
0	I was very happy when I saw the book, and the printing quality was good, but after only reading it for a day, the page fell off, and I was depressed after reading one page. I don't know how to explain Dangdang? 
0	The fan is loud, and I am worried that it will become noisy after a period of use; the game is uncomfortable, but there is no way; it is relatively heavy due to the battery 
0	"Book a standard room: a corner room (why Ctrip booked a corner room), the room is very small, the soundproofing is very poor, the room is very cold, the air conditioning is almost not working, the bathroom is colder, and it is almost impossible to shower! Three words ""not satisfied""! "
0	The price is not the cheapest. China Merchants or Shanghai Pudong Development Bank is 238*12=2856.00. People can also install it in installments. 
0	The facilities are still available, but the service is quite inadequate.After a rest night, I went out during the day. When I came back at noon, the rooms were not cleaned, even though I put up a sign asking for the room to be cleaned. 
0	Because the sound of most DVDs is not clear at all. Only the first and sixth are good. I regret buying this product now. It seems that pirated stuff is really a chance. 
1	I went to stay for two nights last week. I wanted to live in Yuanfei. I didn’t have a room when I booked it. Ctrip recommended this one. The service is really good and there are fruits. Ms. Yan Lei also called to greet herself and went to Weifang every year. Seven or eight times, this place has lived. 
1	The heat dissipation is good, and the sound is very small during operation. Low price, high cost performance, high graphics performance, small keyboard is also very practical 
0	I can only say... horror..., there are actually two doors in the special room, although they are not too big, they also make you sleep well... 
1	The display is good, and the keyboard is good. And there is a small keyboard on the right, which makes it much easier and faster to enter numbers. 
1	It is far from the railway station and bus station, which is not conducive to self-guided travel! But the environment and service of the hotel are still good... 
0	"I stayed in the room in Building B, which is what they call the ""superior room"". Those rooms are the same as the guest house outside. The room has an unpleasant smell (like mopping the floor without washing Smell); and the bed in the double room is too small, but the double room is better. Really, I will never stay at this hotel again. "
0	It feels average, that is, it’s average in all aspects. It’s okay to live in places like Sanmenxia 
0	Although the others are not worth mentioning, this one from Samsung is good. Although the Samsung used before was not good, but this time it was good 
1	Only stayed for one day in a single room, and I feel satisfied. The service is good, the breakfast is good, and the checkout is fast. I went to Xiguan, a family house not far away, for dinner, donkey meat pot, cheap and affordable. The room is a bit smaller, and the desk is a bit crowded with computers. 
0	The room rate is very expensive, there is almost no room to see the Elephant Trunk Hill on the other side. The fruit biscuits delivered are few and not tasty. The decoration is very low-end, far from the city, there is no place to eat nearby, and you have to eat rice noodles Go to the city! (The incidental said it is super hard to hit)!!!! Who wants to burn money, who will live in this old hotel known as Guilin’s first and second 
1	The configuration is not bad at the price of 2899. I just got it yesterday, and the system was installed very quickly. I tried it and the heat dissipation is good. 
0	Ctrip has set a room, but it faces the cemetery, so everyone should pay attention. The service is extremely poor, there are still slippers on the floor of the room that have not been cleaned up, and the spoon is dirty. I didn't come to clean up the next day. The shower curtain in the bathroom is useless, and the shower water will spray everywhere. It is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. depressed! 
1	Reading this book, I have always been in a calm mood. I have made a persistent request to myself. I feel the proverbs in the book and listen to my inner feelings. In fact, the mirror image of my life is just like when a baby is born. The most pure and true self. Personal growth must go through various secular baptisms in the world, and finally choose the road to hell or the road to heaven, all guided by one's own soul, and finally form the inevitable road. So understanding yourself, interpreting yourself, and choosing to read this book is the best gift for life! 
0	In this book, I don’t see what love is at all.///I don’t feel anything, I just feel that teaching girls have become powerful and purposeful,,, makes girls become too material, and teaches people to change Get vanity,,,,,,, 
1	Reasonable configuration, fast speed, no system, no software. The screen is not broken. The appearance is okay, the first time I bought this, I didn't have much experience and didn't have much money. She was happy as a gift to my sister. 
1	The look is pretty good, and it’s been configured. The price is relatively good. I personally think it is a heavier business machine (high-end business machine configuration with Bluetooth and fingerprints) 
1	I heard this book from my friends. When I was okay, when I arrived at Dangdang, what attracted me the most was the pictures of water crystals. Those pictures of water crystals are so beautiful. I was really hungry. I never thought of water crystals. It’s even more magical. My home is in Heilongjiang. My understanding of water is the ice lanterns in our ice and snow world. Although the carvings are beautiful, they can be described as ingenious, but they are all made to cater to the appreciation of tourists. The knowledge of water crystals has never given him life. It is really beautiful and makes your soul more pure, like water crystals! 
1	The environment is relatively old, but the sheets and towels are relatively clean, and the front desk service attitude is good. 
0	It’s easy for a person to be famous, but a gentleman who loves money needs to make a good way. A book with only 100,000 characters costs 20 yuan. It’s too dark, plus the book is very large, there are many empty pages, and the words are not enough, but I still use the painting to make up, what is this? He kept saying that he wanted to learn from Confucius, and he was also a good dragon man. 
1	The advantages are: long standby time, good keyboard feel, wireless network card is 802.N fast, has Bluetooth, CPU is N280, the overall feeling is good. 
0	I generally don't want to write reviews, but this is really the worst of the five-star hotels I have stayed in and the Renaissance brand hotel. The room is of course far-fetched. A colleague in the same industry asked me if this hotel is very old and the bathroom facilities are also very old. The equipment in Tianjin is incomparable with the Renaissance hotel I have stayed in Suzhou. In addition, I booked an executive room, and the speed of the procedures allowed me to have breakfast. It was really painful. There were four people in our group, and it took at least 15 minutes to complete the procedures alone. And the breakfast made me suspect that it was a five-star hotel breakfast. There was no freshly squeezed orange juice. The fruit was terrible. The seasonal vegetables were even more unpalatable. There was only one winter melon. I drank a cup of soy milk and a bowl of porridge. 
1	I saw the movie first. I didn’t know it was the hottest spot at the time. I thought it was beautiful. The pictures of vampire movies are dark, mysterious, and bloody. emotion. So I bought the book, honestly preconceived, when I read the book, the faces of the actors in the movie naturally appeared. It has a sense of picture, but in general, the translation is not good, the thoughts are not coherent, it seems that it is the impatient literal translation of Chinglish instead of Chinese narrative habits, which is too mixed. Fortunately, the storyline is more fascinating. 
0	False advertisement, 9.5 hours to deceive people, I charge for 12 hours each time, and adjust the Bluetooth, wireless, screen ink to two power saving, only 5 hours 
0	This book is one of the worst books I have bought. I think it has the following problems: First, the pictures are too small and the layout of the pictures is crowded, not suitable for my kindergarten daughter, even myself It feels uncomfortable to see. Second, there are cultural differences. The character scenes and drawing styles in the book are all Western. I think it is not suitable for Chinese children to recognize, because it is difficult for them to correspond to the objects in the book with the objects around them in reality. For young children, it may not be possible to understand the connotation of some Western humor. Third, I think it lacks a distinct theme. For example, one of the storytelling books is obviously a simple collection of some stories. There is no connection between the stories, and the theme of the story has no division of labor (for example, it can be divided into nature, love, Wisdom, sports, etc.), so after watching it, I can't remember what I saw. 
0	I feel that this book is not very cost-effective! I don’t like it very much, and the child doesn’t like it very much either, it always says no, there is nothing in it 
1	It is worthy of the state guesthouse, the deep house compound, there is a guard at the door, and there is a guard station inside, and most people dare not approach it, but the yard is too deep (you have to go far to enter the building), and it is inconvenient to not drive by yourself. The house is good (although it is only 7 cheap ones), and there are two free bottles of mineral water-the only one of the three hotels in Changchun where I live, and the breakfast is not good-the worst of the three. 
0	The first time I checked into this hotel apartment through Ctrip, the front desk service attitude of the hotel was extremely rude. I arrived at the hotel at about 9 o'clock on September 30. I was planning to put down my luggage and go to see F1. However, the receptionist said that if I entered the host before 10 am, I would also charge a half-day room charge, saying that this is a hotel policy. I asked him to find the manager. He said that it was useless to find anyone. The computer had already set up a fixed program. I asked him to tell me the complaint hotline for Shanghai Golden Week, but he said he didn't know. Finally, I called Ctrip, and Ctrip negotiated with the hotel for a while before checking in for me. This is simply an unreasonable rule. If a half-day room charge is charged for check-in before 10 am, can the hotel charge a day and a half for a day? Advise everyone who plans to stay at this hotel, be sure to confirm the check-in time at the time of booking without any room charge. 
0	The speakers feel pretty good, yes, but they have not passed the Dolby certification. Toshiba's laptop does not have a CD, so depressed! ! What should I do if the system crashes, or the home version, disgusting! C drive partition format, simply can not stand! ~ Unable to resize the partition normally! ! Hard work! 
0	The next day after the purchase, the boss went to the computer store to have a look, and the same thing was given as a package + mouse 5300 and he was depressed! ! ! ! Everyone calculate the difference 
1	"When I was in high school, I read a sentence in a classmate’s article that ""learning to give up means success."" At that time, I gave up having fun, focused on studying, and was admitted to a satisfactory school. This was a small success. After graduating, I found a relatively stable job, lived in a muddle-headed manner, and gradually forgot ""willing to"". Suddenly, I found the status quo similar to the protagonist, but I don't know how to change it. After reading this book, I have some insights and I still need to explore it slowly. After all, life is not as simple as it was when I was in school. We have been exploring ""willingly"" throughout our lives. "
0	For VISTA system, you need to engrave a system restore disk (you will be prompted when you first use the computer), if you bring a recovery system disk, it’s fine~ 
0	The heat dissipation is not good. In summer, the air conditioner is no longer used, and it runs for 4 hours and crashes 3 times. The appearance of the notebook is almost meaningless, but the price is right. If you play games, haha, it's relatively poor. Need for Speed 11 looks a bit untouchable. 
0	The room has a peculiar smell, the outdoor temperature is below 10 degrees when checking in, but the central tone of the room is only cold! ! ! ! Outdated indoor facilities! The outdoor sound is noisy! The waiter can only be seen in the lobby! Overall very bad! It should only be regarded as a quasi-two star! 
0	I didn't know this Core Duo was originally a simplified version before I bought it. . . But the price is not wronged. The system is also more troublesome, but fortunately, the installation of XP has been successfully carried out with the guidance of an expert. I don't know if the drivers are all down, so I will use it for now. 
1	This book introduces simple scenes in life, which is lively and interesting. It is catchy to read and children are more interested. 
0	Maybe Du Lala is a symbol of success, but if my friends around me are as vicious as Du Lala, it is difficult for me to get along with her. So I don’t understand why this book is so popular. The article contains Tao, what Tao is it this time? After all, what made her complacent was only the little bit of ambiguity that the long-haired foreigner had towards her. She traded this for some benefits, and couldn't help but ecstatic that she didn't have to trade her body. Her work style and attitude are similar to most women who work normally in the workplace. Who has never worked overtime in an empty office until the early hours of the morning? The only difference is that there are no long-haired devils in the big class room. 
1	The notebook is a genuine original, not a prototype or a newly-brushed machine. The performance of the graphics card is not bad. Although the graphics memory is DDR2, it can work as fast as 550/1400, which is comparable to the mainstream graphics card 8600GT in 2008. And it does a good job in energy saving, it can automatically adjust the frequency and speed, and when browsing the web without playing games, the power consumption is significantly reduced. The best thing is that the packaged memory stick is a single 2G South Asian stick, which can be upgraded to 4G. In addition, the quality of the bag is very good. Although it is a little thin, it is comfortable to carry and has many functional pockets. 
1	There is a way to fold clothes, which is pretty good. However, I think the editor seems to ignore a group of college students. To be honest, I used those methods to fold clothes to tidy up the closet, but the kitchen and the floor have nothing to do with me. I still want to know how to wash the clothes to be the cleanest, and how to pick up the lines of the books. In order to be tidy, how to put things in the handbag so as not to be messy, and how to organize the desk. Now the desks and wardrobes of college students are basically like this, so there should be a lot of readers 
0	The system is too difficult to install, it took me a day. Others are OK. Come up today, and the special price is 1999, more value 
1	Although I like this book very much, I am still a little disappointed. . . I don’t know if it’s because of printing. The picture of the book is a bit black and the taste is very heavy. 
0	The print quality of the book is good, but the content is not applicable to me, like an educational manual. Anyway, it is not practical. Moreover, it is said that it is free shipping during the reading festival, not free at all. con man. 
0	1. McAFee and Office07 only have a trial period of 1-2 months, they will be bought right away, which is troublesome; 2. The battery can only be used for less than 2 hours if it is not used, and it is still in the energy-saving mode 
1	Quiet in the middle of noisy, convenient transportation, affordable price, basic services, room facilities are a bit simple, but worth recommending. 
0	I don’t know whether the breakfast tableware here is disinfected or not. I saw the waiter took the received tableware and washed it by hand on the faucet and put it back on the plate for the guests. It's disgusting to think about it 
0	For reasons of not believing in evil, I stayed in the hotel. I checked the reviews on Ctrip before, and the most recent reviews have been around for half a year. I wishful thinking that the hotel facilities have improved. However, I can only use three to describe it, bad! difference! difference! A terrible overnight stay. The elevator is still scary, the room smells musty, and one light is broken! The next day I switched to the next hundred holidays. 
1	The quality of the rooms and the environment is definitely 5 stars. The quality of the food is excellent. It's just far from the city center. But the hotel has a shuttle bus. If you can catch the shuttle bus, it's perfect. 
1	"The reason why I discovered the bizarre history of the Republic of China and I am very interested is because I read Zichai’s long online novel ""Chang Feng"". Can not help but laugh, from time to time. It is precisely because of reading novels and watching the film case that I found out that the history of the Republic of China was so interesting and thought-provoking. It is recommended that you read ""Chang Feng"" carefully, and then read this book. "
1	Relative price, the hotel is really good, convenient, clean and tidy, 
1	I have read the content in a bookstore in Shanghai before I decided, but the bookstore in Shanghai is at the original price, so I decided to book the content of this book very well!! There are some lines, the best thing about idioms is that they have etymology, from The native words in Arabic and Persian are written clearly? A or Bo? In this way, you can immediately think of the corresponding Arabic and Persian words, so that it is easier to remember the native words in the past. Relying on feelings to think about whether the book came from Awen and Bowen on March 15th in Dangdang. Now it is March 18th. Dangdang is out of stock. In only three days, it was out of stock. 
1	The price is cheap and the configuration is quite high. The configuration looks good at the price of 2899, and the system is installed very quickly. After a trial, the heat dissipation and everything are good. 
1	I stayed at this hotel every time I went on business. The hotel did a good job of service. The front desk lady was very polite, well-trained, and very enthusiastic. Since the plane arrived late at night, the lobby manager sent a car to pick me up. They This kind of warm, meticulous and thoughtful service makes people feel at home, and I will stay in this hotel next time. 
0	1. The keyboard is hard 2. There is no Bluetooth 3. The A side is a fingerprint collection board 4. The sound is low 5. There is no CD attached. The screen effect seems to be problematic (maybe I have not adjusted the contrast) 7. The graphics card performance is slightly weak 8. No 1394 port 
0	My personal feelings are average, too many comprehensions and evaluations from the perspective of the third party, but the feelings of the readers are quite different. Almost can't stand it. Especially in the section where Heton and the radio host hosted the show together, the book talked about how smart the female psychologist is and how attractive the show is to the audience, but from the description in the book, I feel that if I hear this Radio programs must be changed! I also pointed out some passages specifically to my husband, and he refused to read it after reading one. I jumped and watched it at the end, with a feeling: the reputation is hard to lose! 
1	A child needs us to choose good books for him to fully guide and show his own way, so that he is not lost, confident, independent, and sound personality. It is necessary to cultivate children's interest in reading since childhood. This set of foreign award-winning children's books by Xinlei Publishing House is generally good, suitable for preschool to elementary school. Some stories will be inspired by adults while telling children. If you have the ability, it is recommended to buy a set, so that children can read more books. Literature nourishes the soul. 
0	The processor is better, of course, the price is not the same. The video memory of the graphics card is very powerful, and the bit width is very low. Only a bag, no mouse, 
0	No shortcomings have been found yet! But now I am more worried about the HDMI output problems mentioned by other Xiongtai. 
0	1. Although the graphics card capacity is 1G, but the bit width is only 128 bits, it feels like a business gimmick; 2. The two pairs of usb ports on the right side and the back side are too close. If the interface of the cable is relatively large, they cannot be at the same time Insert two of them. 
0	The hotel room is too dirty. I almost didn’t throw up when I brushed my teeth. Their faucets were covered with dirt, and some places in the bathtub were rusty. Alas, when I slept, I saw that their quilts were not tight. The things are exposed. The carpet is not clean and there is a smell in the room. 
1	The hotel’s service is good. I went to a booked deluxe double room. Later, because there was no room type I booked, I was automatically upgraded to a business suite. This is still more comfortable. In addition, breakfast is okay now. It is because it is not far from the airport that the aircraft noise is relatively loud. Hotel Feedback March 14, 2008: Dear guest, hello, thank you very much for your recognition of the service and breakfast of Xiamen Lixuan Hotel. We have been improving the software service of the hotel. In addition to the noise problem, the hotel was renovated in May 2007, which largely solved the noise problem. Welcome your next visit! 
0	If you don’t give XP, give a VST. I’m so stupid that I can’t resist it. Also, you have to install the graphics card driver first. If you install other drivers, you cannot install the graphics card driver. I don’t know what happened. 
0	I think most people bought this book because of Ailing. The general feeling is not good. Maybe there is only a little value. If you want to study Zhang Ailing, you might as well take a look. The character is poor and Ailing is more unjust. However, it can also be realized that this population must be good. On the outside, the quality and accomplishments are good, and the knowledge range is also wide. The typical scholars in the late Qing Dynasty belonged to the kind who linger on the Qinhuai River. 
1	High cost performance, better configuration than N270, longer battery life, and fast delivery from JD. Orders are placed at night and delivered the next afternoon 
0	I can’t connect to HDMI, consult technical service and say that the product is too new, and they don’t know how to get it, depressed! 
0	The hotel is relatively old, close to the airport and can hear a lot of noise. The air conditioner is not turned on, the smell in the house is dizzy when the window is closed, the window is basically noisy, and the breakfast is very poor. 
0	The pre-installed ** system is too complicated, not suitable for home use, and the price is a bit high. In addition, it is perfect! ! ! Ha ha! 
0	"But as far as the positioning of ""Hundred Lectures"" is for middle school students, the positioning of this book is still more appropriate, and middle school students are fine. "
1	A very good book, systematically explained the solution of Sudoku, and briefly explained its development history, you can see the author's strong scientific background. But obviously the author has no knowledge of business rules. In an era when the Internet is so developed, I didn't even follow up on the timely update of the accompanying CD-ROM program, and I have not been able to successfully run it on any computer. This shows the author's crude attitude on this matter. Overall, it is a Chinese masterpiece of Sudoku, so I highly recommend it! 
0	I didn’t receive this book with Ben. What is going on on your website? I bought the book and haven't received it yet. I was really disappointed that the book did not receive any comments from me. I don’t want to say too much, just a word, I bought this book from you, and I haven’t received the book yet. 
1	The battery is very durable, even if there is no claim of 9.5 hours, there are 5-6 hours, and you can go out without a power supply. It's okay to run the average application speed. Looks pretty 
1	The environment is very good. . The price of Ctrip in the off-season was quite attractive. Some problems were encountered in the process. . But Ctrip still has a little influence. . Under repeated supervision, the solution was quite satisfactory. . . Praise it. Five-star is really good, and the hot spring is worth a dip. Put yourself in the forest. . Facing Cuihu Lake. . There was drizzle. . And the hot soup. . . Enjoy it very much. . . As it is an inland city, . The consumption level is still lower than that of hotels in coastal cities. The service consciousness is good. . Very cost-effective. . 
1	Super cost-effective notebook! It is very convenient to use. There are already four partitions, and the drive is also in the partition, so friends who install the machine don't worry. Recommend to buy. Similar to the low-end hp520. The memory is Samsung 800, so be careful. 
0	"The keyboard feels poor, the overall workmanship is generally not as good as HP, the invoice warranty period is ""none"", and the warranty period is not clear. "
0	The little guy only knows that he looks at the pictures. The book should be more suitable for parents to read. I personally think the price is high. You don’t need to buy it for educating parents. There are only pictures and no words in the book. It is a few simple pages. not worth. What makes parents wake up is that they are always doing this to the children, that is not to be done. 
1	"""Escape Bunny"" not only tells the child the great maternal love, but also touches me, a woman who is already a mother. The language is simple and simple, but it explains the same love of different people in different countries in the world-maternal love, no matter where the child ""escapes"", the love that the mother pays attention to will always be captured, no matter where the child ""escapes"", it will never escape In the embrace of mother’s love, each of us has been happily captured by love, or will release the love of capture to our children. It repeats itself and continues from generation to generation, endlessly and endlessly, until the earth is old, until the death of life, to Maternal love tribute! "
1	I went with my parents, so I lived in the family room and didn't see the invincible river view. Generally speaking, the hotel is relatively clean. There are particularly many Koreans. But there is always a strange smell in the room, the toilet leaks occasionally, and the shower head is designed to splash water easily. Breakfast is not good. Although there are many shortcomings, it is already regarded as the top hotel in Dandong. 
1	Good location, friendly staff, good breakfast and fast elevator. 
1	The battery is powerful, but not like the legendary 9 hours, the actual estimate is about 6.5 hours; the appearance is exquisite 
0	It's strange to me. Why can't I see the good points when reviewing such a good book? The child doesn't seem to be very interested. 
0	The hotel is on the roadside, but many drivers don't know it. It may be closer to Yunlong Lake. The single room at the wine shop is too small. One side of the bed is leaning against the wall and the curtains are suppressed. The TV has to be tilted to watch. In November, the central air-conditioning hasn't been heated yet! ! ! chilly. 
1	The keyboard is big! I bought it just for the keyboard. I have tried many machines in the store, and the 1000 series can type smoothly. Although HP has a lot of praise, I think it's the same, and the same specifications are much more expensive, and the touchpad is too narrow. The battery is also very cool, everyone said that 
0	"Every book is like this, it looks like a pirated book. If it is published and printed in a regular manner, how can the quality of the cover be guaranteed? ! My son is only 6 months old. I haven't read it yet. I will comment on the ""connotation"" of this book after reading it. . . . Really, taking it out shocked me "
1	After receipt, the packaging is intact. The notebook seal is intact. Very cost-effective, the DVD drive disk contains all necessary VISTA drivers, which is convenient. 
0	The physical resolution of 16:9, the overall look of the screen is relatively short, watching high-definition is good, but you may not be used to playing games and need to adapt. Also, the anti-virus software sent is not very useful at all, it is better to send a mouse. Heat dissipation is still a problem. The arrow keys in the lower right corner seem a bit fragile! 
1	I had to endure the purchase of the DOS system. I thought that 4xxx could buy this configuration and it was worth it. I didn't expect that it would come with Vista when it was turned on. I feel that Jingdong is kind and kind. Use genuine Vista first 
1	Just went to stay for one night last week. It was very good. It has been renovated. Now it is not three-star, but four-star. The view from the room is quite good. The view is very wide. 
1	Overall a good hotel! ! But there are some small details to pay attention to. The board at the computer broadband connection is broken. After breakfast, I found the bottom of the pan in the quiche. . After the negotiation, the shop immediately called to apologize (this is very satisfactory, but I hope that this kind of incident will not happen again in the next stay)! ! Next time I go to Chengdu, I will continue to stay at Sheraton 
1	Piano paint, streamlined body, concise and generous, noise control is very good, speed is very fast, the screen is great, the display effect is not to say; the keyboard feels very good, and it is very comfortable to use. High performance-price ratio, dual-core independent display wireless high-definition also has not fallen, belongs to the all-round mainstream book, really great value. 
0	I thought this was a detailed description of Lust Jie, but I didn't expect most of Zhang's other novels. I was disappointed because I had read most of Zhang's previous works. 
0	"The rooms in the main building of the hotel are not bad, it is recommended not to live in the annex, the quality of the room is far from the four-star standard of the hotel. It is strongly recommended that the hotel improve the quality of staff! ! The service staff has a poor working attitude, and it was discovered that the air conditioner in the room was leaking at 1 o'clock in the middle of the night of the check-in! ! Dizzy, because it was a cheap room at the time, I was not very angry at the time. I wanted to tell the front desk to change room. Who knew the front desk actually said ""It's not convenient to deal with it so late, and it doesn't matter. You will be fine. ""...As a result, I went crazy. Although we changed the room in the end because of our insistence, it still made people feel angry! I paid to stay in the store and couldn't sleep in the middle of the night and wanted to move. I haven't complained yet. She, a staff member on duty, is actually reluctant. I really don't know the quality! ! ! ! "
0	The hotel should strengthen the sense of service, the supporting facilities are poor, some services are not available, and the environment is relatively old. It should be repaired and refurbished, and supporting facilities and services should be strengthened. 
0	A few days ago, Shanxi traveled to Datong and booked this hotel by phone. I feel very upset overall. The room was just up to the three-star standard, but it was reported as a four-star; after moving in, it felt like a bathing center, and the room was not soundproof and messy. The next day, the checkout was done internally and the items in the room were damaged. I went up and said that I checked it wrong. I really don’t know what to do. Next time, please pay attention to hotel taste when recommended by Ctrip. Don't smash the signs. 
1	Marriott is an internationally renowned hotel, and the front desk service is finally qualified and the attitude is good. However, it may be due to Chongqing. The quality of this room is very average, old, small and ordinary facilities. According to this price, you can find rooms in Chongqing's CBD Jiefangbei that are of much higher quality, but the price is much cheaper. The most worth mentioning is the western restaurant next to the hotel lobby. The lunch buffet may be due to lack of business, food freshness and poor service attitude of the waiters plus Chongqing's top five-star charges, and you will immediately decide not to consider going in. I have stayed in several five-star hotels in Chongqing Jiefangbei. It is recommended that if you re-brand guests, if you choose InterContinental, you will find that there is a big difference and good value for money. 
0	1 When the notebook was first started, the fan sounded a bit, but later it stopped. I don’t know why. 2 There is a red dark dot on the top right of the notebook. 
1	After 12 hours of continuous operation, the temperature of the machine has not changed, the heat dissipation is super good, the performance is very good, and the keyboard is also waterproof. My water cup is overturned on the machine. After drying it, there is no problem. The machine runs very quietly. be quiet 
0	The hotel is quite economically minded, and the hearty service of airport pick-up makes people unguardedly plunge into the car rental tour team. Later fellow travellers have to learn from experience, and bargain when it is time to bargain. You must not be soft-hearted, otherwise you will change your distressed money in the future! 
1	"I only learned about this book after hearing a friend’s introduction. I felt like ""I hate it when I met each other"". From the moment I got the book, I couldn’t put it down. I often saw that I went to bed at two o’clock in the morning and went back to that with the protagonist ""Qianwei"". In the distant ages, I was also a Manchu, so I often imagined myself as Qiangwei, laughed with her, moved together, and sacrificed my life for love. The article does not have gorgeous rhetoric, but the very modern language amused me, and at the same time, it also allowed me to learn about the history of the Qing Dynasty with the author. The writing is great! Come on! "
1	This is Beiying's teaching material, and its photography professional strength should be the strongest in the country, so its teaching materials can't be wrong. The author of this book is Gu Zheng. Anyone who knows photography will know him. He is currently a relatively authoritative photography history and photography theorist in China. The regulations of this book are very clear, the language is also very concise, there is nothing trivial, some of the author's views are also very strong. But the only drawback is that the black-and-white version of the picture inside (the last more than ten pages are color pictures, and the front is black-and-white pictures) are printed too dark and a bit distorted. 
1	A very good book. I think it’s the best book I have seen when I set foot in the fashion industry. Students who know English can go to Google. The author Mark Tungate is a well-known fashion journalist and author. He has published several other books. book. I feel particularly deeply that the author frequently participates in various fashion events and interviews these fashion people. The book gives some real quotations. I have already seen it, as if following the author to experience these things. This writing method is also very good. Only a decent writer will do it. Recommend this book! 
0	I decided to buy it after reading the reviews for a long time. I got the book and I was disappointed. I felt that the names of the chicks in it were too difficult to pronounce. I couldn't remember it clearly, and I didn't read it smoothly. What about the daughter that arrived? The picture also looks messy. I read those names and it’s not smooth, and the stories inside are not attractive at all for children over 2 years old. Only put it aside. On the contrary, I later The set of <Naughty Little Grid> I bought, my daughter liked it very much, and after pestering me to tell the story inside, she would still hold it and flip through it by herself. When she got her feet up while measuring her height , I will also say: Xiaoge is like this. In her opinion, she is the same as the naughty Xiaoge. She has done a lot of naughty things, and she has a common sense. Recommend to everyone ! 
1	The heat dissipation control is good, but the picture is a bit miserable when World of Warcraft runs, how can the 512M video memory be so bad? 
1	The location of this hotel, the room price is good. But I wonder if it is due to the large number of guests, the service has naturally declined. Ctrip's guests seem to be not very popular here. Every time you stay, if you do not have a double room or not The room is not, if it hadn’t been cleaned, and the membership card points could not be accumulated. The front desk said it was stipulated above, and there is no basis. Additional comment December 9, 2007: The service of this hotel is getting worse and worse, the hotel The facilities are also old, not as good as before. I will not live anymore. 
1	1. The price is cheap, not much more expensive than some netbooks; 2. The configuration is good, T6400 CPU, 250G hard disk, DVD burning, camera; 
0	The simple word, bad, is like a guest house. The hotel is rather biased. There is no place to eat around. There is only one restaurant run by the hotel itself. The two words inside are unpalatable. 
1	It's okay, but unfortunately I can't help install the memory stick. And my classmate’s second disk can be backed up by double-clicking, but mine can’t 
0	Checked in on May 1st, there is no room in other places, I have set up a special standard room of Jindi Constellation. When I checked in, I was told to upgrade to a superior standard room. I was overjoyed. I didn't expect to pass a messy road (like the outside of the kitchen) ) After arriving at Building 1, I was even more disappointed when I entered the room. Not to mention the small bed, there was nothing, the facilities were outdated, and the noise of the cars on the road was unbearable. I took a shower and the water flowed all over the place, hey, next time Might as well live in a chain business hotel, the price for the same conditions is only 2/3 at most. 
1	I bought it at the encouragement of my classmates, so I bought two sets as soon as I bought it. Waiting eagerly for the book, she couldn't wait to start reading it, leaving behind the online games and TV series that were playing at a critical juncture. When I started to read it, I finally understood her. It's really good. The style of the second part is a little different from the first part, and the language expression is also slightly different, but overall it is still very good. Also, I got the fourth printed version. From a very professional point of view, at this speed, this book is very popular and very good. 
0	The price/performance ratio is average, and the system is not used to LINUX. It is difficult to reinstall the XP system. It took a long time to figure it out. I found a very slight crack in the lower right corner of the computer, which is not easy to find. Use it 
1	I got it and saw that the machine was very beautiful, the XP system was installed smoothly, and it was running very fast. I like it very much. 
1	The newly renovated hotel, the room is very new and very good, as a gold member of Marriott, fully enjoy the treatment of the gold card, very good. The breakfast variety is not rich enough. 
0	The hotel facilities are outdated and it is estimated that it has not been updated for 10 years. The wallpaper and the paint of the bathtub are peeling off, the toilet cover is damaged, the air-conditioning system is basically paralyzed, the noise is relatively high, and there is almost no warm air. There is still a charge for staying in the hotel's internal parking lot. It is suggested that Jiacheng should regularly screen recommended hotels, reserve qualified hotels, and reject unqualified hotels, so as to ensure the overall quality of service. 
0	The room facilities are quite poor. The toilet seat is actually too small. The water in the bathtub drains directly to the drain in the bathroom. The bathroom where you take a bath is full of water, and there is no door card. It is said that it was given to the captain of the traffic police. The waiter has to open the door. Opposite is the railway station, you will never find a hotel near the railway station in the future, it's too bad! 
0	At present, most of the books at this price in China are pre-installed with the BASIC system. If possible, the PRIMIUM system should be pre-installed. The BASIC system is too ugly and it is not as good as XP. 
1	Although there are countless flaws in this book, (maybe Lang’s logical ability needs to be enhanced, and I feel that some examples are indeed too far-fetched), but only the domestic economy, whether viewed from the macro or the micro level, is what Professor Lang’s Western perspective holds. The words are very valuable, and most of his inferences are correct. I personally think that the essence of the book should not be covered up by partial errors. Of course, it is more important to understand something after reading it. After putting down the book, you can change something. 
1	I think this is the hotel I have the best service at Homeinn.. The transportation is convenient, but it is not easy to book the room. Friends who want to stay should book a few days in advance. 
0	I liked this cartoon very much. The description clearly stated that the dialogue was bilingual in Chinese and English, with bilingual subtitles in Chinese and English, without any duplication. When I bought it, I found that there were Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck inside Jingran, and there was no Chinese dialogue and subtitles at all. What's more annoying is that there are repetitions. Too wicked. con man! 
0	I am very anxious and don't know how to raise children. I am a kindergarten teacher. Everyone says that I can educate my children well, but education is not a matter of one person and requires the cooperation of my family. In many cases, you can't do it according to your wishes. I gave this book to my family and we discussed how to educate children. This book teaches us a lot. As a parent, I like it very much, as a teacher, I like it better! 
1	This time I stayed at the Shaolin Hotel and I was quite satisfied. The location of the hotel is easier to find. It only takes three minutes to take a taxi from the bus terminal, and it can be reached for 5 yuan. The room is relatively clean, and it is relatively spacious. Comfortable, the best place is that there is a very busy snack street outside the hotel. It opens around 6 in the evening. There are many snacks such as spicy and spicy, and there are at least 20 or 30 stalls. There are many choices. It is very convenient to solve the problem of eating. , And the price is quite commentable. Together with my friend, two people can eat well for ten dollars :) 
0	In addition to the good location, the service is poor, the room smells big, and the sound insulation is poor. Breakfast is almost impossible to serve. In addition, the waiter often refuses to use credit cards! ! ! 
0	The service is ok. The room is terrible. I live on a business floor. The smell is very strong. The air conditioner is like a high-powered blower. I can only sleep with the windows open and dance with mosquitoes all night (I checked in early in the morning). I would also like to praise the customer service of Ctrip. I don't know why that day. Almost all hotels in Nanning do not have double bed rooms. The customer service is still very patient to help me contact several hotels. 
1	I have stayed at this hotel on June 2, 2006. Jingli’s service is still very good, and the trust given to guests at checkout is very rare. Unlike most hotels, they still have to deliver after asking whether they have used charged items. People check. I read the description of the doorman uncle in the previous comments, and paid attention to the special case. Jingli is worth living. 
1	I stayed in a green suite, don’t know where the green is? The carpet is really dirty, the bed is very hard, it can be loud, there is no air conditioning, can not adjust the heating and cooling! I don't know how many days the welcome fruit has been left, I dare not eat it. 660 A day is not worth it! 
0	1. The screen was produced by AU Optronics in the first week of 2006 (it is rumored that the quality of this batch is not good) 2. The screen flashes randomly from time to time 
0	If it weren't for reading Zhang Ailing's book more familiarly, I wouldn't open this man's book. If it weren't for understanding Zhang Ailing more comfortably, I would not look at this man's opinion of Zhang Ailing. So, I bought it only for others 
0	I lived in a double room, the house was not clean, the bathroom was relatively simple, the breakfast was too few, the restaurant was too slow to serve food, hygiene was also a problem, and flies kept turning around. Will not live again next time. 
1	The external environment is good, the hotel has several buildings, very pleasing to the eye, the lobby is quite quiet, and the decoration is also very petty bourgeoisie, maybe it is just the end of Golden Week. I stayed in a room of 240 yuan in the main building. The four-star price should be very worthwhile in China. The breakfast is buffet, mainly Chinese style, with many varieties, which suits our Chinese people's stomach. When I checked out, I realized that there is a more economical annex building (like Zhanhong Building), which only costs more than one hundred yuan, but there is no star. (The door is still being remodeled) Try it next time. Worth recommendation... Additional comments October 10, 2007: Yes, there are free fruits, very warm feeling, broadband speed is also very fast. 
1	1. Long battery life 2. The keyboard feels better than expected 3. N280's processing speed is acceptable, no problem with daily office applications 
0	The left side of the touch panel will be tilted upwards, the keyboard is uneven and the middle is high, the memory is a little bit less, and it will drop by 200 yuan after not buying. 
1	"I was 21 years old at the time of ""advanced age"". I bought this book by accident, but I was touched once when I read it. The piebald kitten interprets his love for small fish with imagination: I would rather let go to complete the growth of small fish, but Waiting day and night while Xiaoyu was swimming, Xiaoyu finally did not live up to this love, and accompanied the tabby cat for life. Very good book! Although there are only a dozen pages of books, the paper quality is very good, the composition field of view is also very broad, a good choice, not limited to infants and young children, it is definitely educational for adults-how to love! "
0	I had a headache when I saw English, and this book failed to bring up my interest in English. After reading it for a few pages, I gave it to my colleague. It also put a lot of dust on my colleague's desk! 
1	I have bought it for a while, and I have been using a very good new system rebuilt with a USB flash drive. The machine runs quickly and is stable. 
1	The appearance is good, the screen is large, and the viewing is very comfortable, and the resolution is 1280X800. There is indeed the ASUS LOGO at the bottom of the screen. When surfing the Internet at a room temperature of 30 degrees, the temperature of the CPU, GPU, and hard disk is about 50, 50, and 45. The graphics card of the 9650m GT is pretty good in a notebook. The hard disk is Seagate 5400.5, single disc 250G, performance is good. Overall, the machine's price/performance ratio is pretty good. 
1	I saw this book in the school library. I thought my uncle was a great philosopher. The book must be obscure, because I have read some of Nietzsche’s works in the school library before. After reading it, it was not too deep. The impression is that I don’t understand it. But Schopenhauer's book is very beautiful and easy to read, and it solves many puzzled thinking problems in my actual life, so that I am no longer so confused. Although I haven't finished reading this book yet, I have already decided to put this book in my bag and read it frequently in my spare time. This will surely give myself inspiration and harvest from time to time. 
0	The hotel’s service is not good and the waiter’s attitude is blunt, especially in the management of hotel items. The inventory of items is not in place. I obviously didn’t use the charged items in the room, but when we checked out, we insisted that we used four packs of charged lotion. Asking me to pay, I had to pay because I was in a hurry to catch a plane. I couldn't believe that this was a hotel recommended by Ctrip. Does this hotel rely on this to make money? It feels like a black shop. Additional comments March 24, 2008: There is also an electric water heater for bathing, which always makes me feel unsafe and fearful. The toilet is not easy to use, nor is it good after repairing it once. In short, staying in this hotel feels very awkward, feels unsafe and uncomfortable. It feels noisy all around. 
1	This machine is out of stock in Beijing, and I finally ordered one. I just got it today. The overall feeling is still good. Good luck, and the screen has no bright spots. And after running continuously for 5 hours, the right palm rest is slightly hot, but it is acceptable. The overall appearance is also beautiful! 
1	Because children are afraid of the sound of firecrackers, we have the habit of spending the night in the hotel every year on New Year’s Eve and fourth night 
0	It is easy to leave fingerprints. You should buy a white one. The keyboard is loose, and the bottom is not close enough. There are two partitions but the size is too unreasonable. The c drive is actually divided into 70G, and the xp netbook is completely unnecessary. it is okay! 
1	Stayed for three nights and the overall feeling is pretty good. The most satisfactory is the free upgrade provided by the hotel. The booked is a business standard room. Due to full capacity, the hotel upgraded us to a high-level business standard room for free. Like one here. To talk about the shortcomings, one is that the sound insulation effect mentioned by netizens is not very good. The other is that the air conditioner is not hot, and it is still cold all night. After inquiring about the hotel, it seemed that there was no hot air conditioner. 
0	It’s a joke, joining the author’s personal social activities, as a medical book, unprofessional, mediocre writing, a bit messy 
1	The outside is very beautiful, suitable for girls. I brought it for someone and thought it was okay, but the system didn't figure it out. Later, I installed XP directly, and the XP had to be sp3 or higher! Otherwise it can't be used, this is worth noting! 
1	Nice hotel. Always liked it. But now the hotel needs to be improved: 1. Breakfast. I have stayed in this hotel N times, but breakfast is the same every time. Now I can even remember the position of each plate. 2. Compared with the current market, the business single room is still a bit small, which will affect the subsequent move-in. 
0	I had great expectations for this book at the time...Who knew that the content was completely opposite to the title!!!! Not only is it not funny...The illustrations in it are fake...it seems I reluctantly brought some pictures to PS...Too reluctant to find the ballast...It doesn't work at all!!!! 
0	1 The noise is a bit high (when it is quiet at night) 2 It is still a bit heavy 3 The shell is easy to leave fingerprints 4 It took a long time to install XP 
0	"The main reason why I chose the ""Mold Garden"" Hotel is the convenience of work. The room smells of mildew. The Samsung Hotel may be Huai'an standard. There is no service. There is no desk lamp, but the breakfast is absolutely green. There are many varieties of whole grains. "
0	The battery time is a bit short and it is less than two hours. The panel is easy to get dirty. I installed Kugou music a few days ago, and didn’t turn off any shortcuts of Kugou, but when it was running, I accidentally pressed the right button and it crashed. 
0	"I don’t like to write a book like this, and then spend my time reading it! I think this kind of language is more suitable to blow on the CCTV ""Hundreds of Forums""~~~ I think history should be a little more serious~~~ "
0	Generally speaking, this book is okay, but there are some parts that I don’t know very well, such as not knowing the approximate location by acupuncture points. 
1	Very good 5 star hotel. The room is also very clean, but the TV is too small, and it is far from the bed, it is not clear. The attitude of the service staff is also very good. Will definitely live again next time. 
1	Hidden partitions take up less and can be formatted. The biggest problem is the fever, it is simply Flaming Mountain! ! The most real situation is that the cooling system of this book is quite good, but the heat generation is also quite objective! ! ! If the heat is not good enough, it will explode long ago! ! 
0	It didn't take long to drop another 100 yuan, and there was no num lock display. Slightly heavier than expected. The propaganda of that storage is too nonsense. I searched for a long time where the 10G is, but found it was online. I am angry, is this false propaganda? 
0	1. There is no locking mechanism when the cover is closed. 2. Although it is a new version, it feels that the new features are useless, but the price is several hundred more. Different people have different opinions. 3. There is no advantage in the price. I asked Xia Zhongguancun, and I could get it in 1950. I bought it online to save trouble. 
0	It feels like I was cheated by someone like this. Even I saw a funny article on other blogs. 
1	If I were to travel to Dongguan by myself, I would still stay in Dongguan Hotel, but if I came to Dongguan with my boss, I might live in Sofitel. I like the environment of Dongguan Hotel and its several restaurants. It is very quiet and comfortable in the busy city, and the service of the hotel is also very good. For ordinary business travelers, the standard rooms of Dongguan Hotel are the best value for money. 
1	I have bought many books on children's education, only this book I bought and read it immediately. Many chapters have been read several times. Many of the educational concepts in it were spoken by the author. They are not dogmatic and easy to accept. No matter from the children's character, study or good habits, I have gained a lot. The biggest gain is my own growth. It is true that it is not a parent who has a child. There are so many things to learn as a parent. I want to grow up with my son^_^ 
1	The keyboard is good, the SHU logo presented is a bit small, the sound effect is good, the configuration is higher, but it is a bit heavy, it is fine to drive with, and it is more sad to take the bus and subway. 
0	Very bad hotel, I don’t understand why some reviews say it is good, 1. The hotel is very old, the room smells very musty, I complained to the front desk, the front desk actually said that every room is like this, when it comes to fire, the room is adjusted, but it is just the situation It’s a little better, but it still smells of musty 2. The room facilities are not good, the air conditioner blows to midnight, and suddenly it loses its function, it is not cold at all, it is stuffy all night, and people can’t sleep well 3. The lower floor of the hotel is an office building , The elevator is shared, the speed is very slow, it is a waste of time 4. The security of the parking lot is very poor, and I don’t want to open the fence on rainy days, so that the car can approach the door of the hotel, until we open the door to curse, the service is very poor July 3, 2015: Dear guest: Hello! We apologize for your unpleasant experience at the hotel, and please accept the most sincere apology from the hotel. Thank you for your valuable comments. The hotel leaders attach great importance to this. A special meeting has been held to find problems and implement improvements. We will continue to improve in management and improve the quality of service to ensure that every guest can feel at home. Thank you for your support to the hotel and sincerely look forward to your visit again! 
0	The price is reduced by 100 on the second day of purchase~~ The flash of the farmer’s orchard on Kaixin.com will be a bit stuck. There is no free gift. 
0	"I don't understand why other people's computers are in what color computer is equipped with what color bag, why I bought two white EPCs (901 and this one), all of them are ugly and black? In addition, the frame is so wide. When can EPC be ""thin and boundless""? "
1	The geographical location is relatively convenient, shopping, traveling and doing business are relatively convenient. The old hotel was newly decorated and modified. The facilities in the room are simple and clean, but the overall building facilities of the hotel are relatively old. 
1	1 It looks good, and the Disney prints are done well, but the stickers are a bit tasteless. 2 The heat dissipation is very good, and I don’t feel the heat is too much when playing games and surfing the Internet. This performance notebook is also 13-inch. It is not easy to achieve this. It is much better than the HP notebook I bought last year. 3 The weight is well controlled. 
1	The room is nice, but the internet speed is unbearably slow. It takes half an hour to open a webpage and can't even receive email. Another front desk staff service attitude is very good, but efficiency has improved. 
0	"When I checked in, I was near the exhibition. When I arrived at the front desk, I was told that the order was cancelled because I was 1 hour late. I asked if there are any rooms, and answered: ""No"" (probably because the business is too good and I don't want to do Ctrip business). I reported to Ctrip that it was a credit card guarantee order-so there was a room immediately. When I entered the room, I found that it had not been cleaned. It was reported to the front desk and told to deal with it immediately. As a result, I waited for 40 minutes and urged 4 times. The waiter came after a fire. The room is good, without unnecessary facilities, but the external wall is hung with vertical frames, and the wind is blowing and hunting, affecting sleep. It’s not over yet, I bought a meal voucher in the morning and went to the cafeteria-nothing left, no porridge. Could it be that two people spend 30 yuan to share the only piece of bread? There are others who are also watching. "
0	After being introduced by a friend, I bought this book. The topic is quite good and very contagious. After praying with expectation, I realized that the content was scattered and empty, and the more I watched it, the more bored I became. I lent it to friends who are already parents, and they feel the same with me. Anyway, the only thing we have in common in the books is that we must look at and considerate children from the perspective of children. Respect and consideration are all necessary-this truth should be known even by unparents. We just want to be better. Many practical processing skills. It is a pity that this book did not give us very good help in this regard! 
0	The facilities are outdated, and the worst part is that the room is too small (single room). Except for a bed, I was wondering whether the standard room would be larger for the same price? I can't believe this is a four-star hotel. 
1	I checked in on May 21st and left on May 22nd. The company reimbursed me at the end of the month. The financial department believed that the hotel's invoice and stamp had been blurred and needed to be reopened. I was on a business trip, so I entrusted the company's finance company to send the vague invoice to Mr. Ye from the front office on May 28. On June 11, the company's finance still did not receive the reissued invoice----------hurry, me! Additional comments June 18, 2008: On June 18, I finally received the invoice. Thanks to Mr. Ye from the hotel, I also strongly protest China Post. It would take so long for a registered letter from Jiaxing to Shanghai. 
0	"The quality of the book is not good, it will be broken when you flip it, and the content of the book is not good, it is useless, and it is not funny! It's simply not as good as ""I am an English word book""! ! I suggest you not buy it! ! "
1	Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters
1	This is an official novel that is very close to reality. Just as Mr. Chang Zhiqi said after the book, against the cold current of midnight and tearing through the darkness before dawn, it created a group of characters of all kinds in the dramatic changes of history. Seven emotions and six desires, I don’t know whether human nature is originally good or evil at the beginning. Is there a hidden wildness in the human bone? Maybe there is, but people should also have the rationality to curb wild impulses. Does the human mind, spirit and sentiment stick to the temptation?,,, this book allows me to re-examine human nature.,, let me If you think about it, you have something,,, 
1	The battery is indeed durable and the overall workmanship is not bad. The running speed is also acceptable. The machine has a two-year global warranty, which is good. 
0	There is 1 dead pixel on the screen! ! ! It’s just that the SATA driver of the CD-ROM is not very clear, and there are useless drivers (such as fingerprints). Jingdong sent many things, and a mouse was so stingy. Don’t give away the Rising thing~~~ just replace it with a mouse! 
0	The speaker has no bass harshness, and the part of the power cord connected to the transformer can only be inserted into 2/3. I wonder if anyone else will. It does not affect the use of 
0	Really poor hotel, strongly not recommended! CTRIP is getting more and more out of place now! ! The standard room is still luxurious, and when I enter the room, the two beds are actually leaning against each other 
0	The book review said it was very good. The little niece didn't read it, and even the colorful pictures in it didn't attract her. I don't know if children don't like learning, or books are not suitable for Chinese children, Khan! ! ! ! 
1	Today I bought another set for my daughter’s class teacher. I hope all the students in the class can get the correct guidance! 
1	"I bought the 2004 ""Revised History"". It can also be regarded as ""Revising the History"". I read a few articles first, and the more I read it, the more it tastes. Look at Mr. Shen Jiguang's ""Listening to the Historical Echoes in the Hands of the Ancestors"", which provides another perspective that inspires us to pay attention to life, and tells us that the world uses echoes in the depths of the soul to perceive and talk. Yimin in troubled times-Kang Tongbi's mother and daughter, Shen Congwen's 1949, the ""bibliographic"" disturbance in Shanghai's literary world in 1933, provided us with those focus points in the torrent of life and let us touch a state. Reading is more flavorful. "
1	I don't know if all the books published by Tsinghua University are so useful and insightful. The simulation in this book is mainly based on ORCAD-based power electronic simulation. There is no redundant introduction in software. If you are not familiar with this software, it is recommended to study ORCAD first, and then go to this book. When it comes to simulation, there are many algorithms involved, and there are comparisons with various algorithms, which are worth learning. If you are messed up with modeling, I suggest you take a good look at this book. The book mentions a lot about modeling. The example is very enlightening to me. 
1	A few days ago, when I saw an article by Ye Zhaoyan about his father who loves books, I couldn't help being frightened when I saw others' eyes sweeping his bookcase. Knowing that someone borrowed a book and would not pay it back, but still bite the bullet to borrow. Sometimes, when he meets a regular customer with a prior record, he is desperate, and he often goes to the bookstore to buy another copy just after borrowing the book. I also came to buy it again, O(∩_∩)O which is matched with other famous books~ By the way, like this book, the classic version, the cheap price, I personally like it better~ 
1	Most American detective novels are in the tough guy style, such as the pioneering work by Raymond Chandler, and the Matthew Scudder series by Bullock. And this masterpiece written by a female writer shows the delicateness and perseverance unique to women, as well as the perseverance to survive and fight in a man's world. Of course, there is still no way to escape the personal heroism peculiar to American culture. As a law student, reading this book will give you an alternative understanding of the American legal system. I look forward to other great works in this series. 
0	It's too simple. Not to mention the USB placement. I found that the right keyboard is very soft near the CD-ROM drive, and the keyboard on the left is very sturdy. The seam of the last row of keyboards on the right is much larger than the others, and you can see a small hole that penetrates below 
1	1. The most worth mentioning of this product is the price/performance ratio. The HP brand and the P8600 CPU are enough. Other upgrades are too cheap. 2. The workmanship is still very good compared to this price. However, compared to the IBM T23 and X41 I have used, there is still some distance, but the price is there. Overall, it's pretty good. 3. Jingdong's service is not bad. Customers can see the progress of express delivery from the Internet. 
1	"I watched the novel because of the TV series. I watched the TV series on Star TV. Because of Ryoko Yonekura’s decisiveness, I like this show. The portrayal of human nature makes people tremble and the novel is more depressing. Yes, On Island’s love, Atom’s subsequent revenge, all give people unlimited hope, while the novel smashes all these unrealistic fantasies one by one. Some are, but the human heart’s greed and the struggle for profit are the last ""Help!"" The ending is short and powerful, and it continues the gray tone of Matsumoto Kiyaki, broken, unwilling, real, cruel "
0	This is the weakest point of this machine. The majority of netizens have reported that it is very difficult to install the XP system. I also tried a lot of XP system disks, but they all ended in failure. I am depressed. Many HP machines are all the same. You can only install a vITSA. After all, VISTA is a big trend. 
0	1. The luxurious furniture in the room is not practical and does not have the warmth of home. 2. I found a mouse crawling at the house in the early morning. I called the front desk and asked to change the room. The front desk asked me to go downstairs and change the room card. Sleeping 3. After being transferred to a low-priced room, the next day, the bill will be settled at the high price, and I will apologize for the pointlessness of the mouse found in the room 4. over 
1	The business big bed room booked is generally okay. The facilities inside are simple but more user-friendly; the hotel staff is very friendly and enthusiastic, but the breakfast is not very tasty. 
0	The included hard disk, original mouse, bag and memory stick are all OK. Where is the serial number of Rising Anti-Virus? ? ? ? I read the comments and said that there is a scratch card. I don't know that the hero has seen it in the gift, but I didn't find it. 
1	This book is printed very well and has a sense of quality! The content is simple and easy to understand, combined with a brief analysis of real life, and the contrast between the past and the present, awakening five thousand years of historical facts in China. After reading this book, I will have a deeper understanding of Kunqu Opera, and worship the incomparable creativity of the predecessors! 
1	Armed his son, opened the book. The picture is rich, but the text is simple and pure. It looks like two small trees, but they are everyone in life. The son is a kind and generous child, but when he is with children, he will inevitably have conflicts. Reading to his son not only wants him to cherish friendship and treat his friends well, but also hope to infiltrate him. There will always be parting gains and losses in future life. , To be peaceful but also to face it positively. More forgiveness, more possession, suitable for him who is growing up, and also suitable for us who have experienced sophistication! It is a good book to taste with your heart! 
1	"To say that it is a mystery novel is better to say that it is a sad love story. The protagonist’s ordinary life has changed drastically after the car accident, and the trajectory of his life is moving towards constant decisions amidst major changes. A choice in loss. I may from the beginning, the protagonist is destined to lose everything, but he is insisting, insisting on a belief. Although this book is very plain, it is worthy of the work of Master Dongye, and only cares about the story The ending of Dongye's work is the most anticipated place. Recommend ""White Night Walk"", the writing is great. "
0	No optical drive, 1G memory is too small, vista is really bad, even my husband, who is a chronic person, can’t stand the boot, the battery is too bad, and the express delivery is poor. It is said that Beijing 24 hours delivery, I actually waited 3 days 
1	The advantages of the brand machine, the cost performance is okay, so far, the operation is fairly stable, and it can perform uncomplicated graphics processing. 
1	When climbing Lion's Head Mountain, it suddenly rained heavily. The stairs in the rain had nowhere to hide, so I had to let the rain get wet. At this time, the sound of rain was clearly heard, as if desperately applauding. We always applaud under the stage, but always forget to applaud for ourselves. Where there is no stage, the earth applauds for itself. We should learn and always applaud for ourselves when climbing dangerous steps. In the dark place, give yourself some applause, in the bright place, also applaud for yourself. Like it very much, and with success and failure, there should be such an attitude. Only for self-love can we love better. 
1	Marriott's hotels are well managed. The hotel environment is also very good. 
0	"The reserved executive room is facing the utility room, and they are always open, not to mention the mess. After requesting to change the room, the air conditioner in the room is not cooling, and the refrigerator is turned to the bulldozer. Decoration, I don’t know what Ctrip is having with this hotel. I always feel that I am deliberately making you uncomfortable. In addition, there are no internal instructions on the phone in all rooms, so I let the guests call back to the hotel by long distance. Why is that.. It really affects the harmonious environment of Beijing’s appearance and the Olympic Games. The smell of the restaurant delivery in the room will make you spit out. This is the most ""unforgettable"" hotel I have stayed in. I have restrained these words. . "
1	Xiaobo flipbook is a good set of books. My son is four and a half years old and he knows some Chinese characters. He can basically read it with interest, and he has a sense of accomplishment. I regret it was too late to buy him. I think this set of books is more suitable for children around 3 years old. The story is simple, with few characters, high repetition rate of Chinese characters, and literacy and reading stories kill two birds with one stone. What's better is that this set of books has English interpretations, so parents can selectively teach their children a little English. Flipping through the book, turning over the folding pages, children can discover novel words and worlds, and children are interested in reading. 
0	On September 30th, I booked 2 rooms for one night with my friend (coming to Hunan from Germany and planning to go to Zhangjiajie). At the checkout the next morning, the waiter insisted that the room was missing one hanger. My friend had to go up to the 6th floor to see it. The number of waiters was wrong. My friend is very angry, saying that the hotel staff can't count them? The occurrence of such a thing makes the guests feel very unpleasant and at the same time delays the checkout time of the guests. 
1	The configuration in the netbook is pretty good. I grabbed it at the 2999 special price. This time I mentioned it by myself. I don't see any problems so far. I hope it can be maintained. The battery can last more than 6 hours, not 8 hours. The screen is small, but that’s for sure 
0	Because I lived there last year, I feel like the room has been renovated. But breakfast seems to be different from last year. When I went, two foreigners went to a luxurious restaurant, and I was arranged below. . . The breakfast is very poor. . Not even a salad. . If you need to buy a better breakfast, the hotel should first explain to the customer. 
0	I checked in on April 5th. I really regret it. Although it is a Samsung, it is only the standard of a guest house. The room facilities are extremely old. The most terrible thing is that after getting up at 8 o'clock on the first day, there is no hot water. Call to the main station Say wait and wait. Later, I simply said that it is impossible to have hot water in the morning. Really! Later, when I arrived at the scenic spot, I found that many family hotels are much better, and the prices are cheaper. Strongly request Ctrip not to recommend this hotel again! 
1	The battery lasts for 6 hours, not the 8 hours introduced. It looks good. I bought it at 2999. Why did the price increase one day after I bought it? This is considered profitable? 
0	Without memory, vista is slow, and ibm XP recovery disk is more difficult to download! Third-party delivery is slow. 
0	The hotel is too old. There is a vibration when walking on the floor. The toilet paper in the toilet is just a little bit. The price of 220 does not include breakfast. The most annoying thing is that if you swipe your card, you have to charge a 2% fee, and that's fine. At the time of checkout, the waiter even said that the room fee plus handling fee is 224.4 yuan, and you will be charged 225 yuan. I find it strange, even if it is rounded, it should not be rounded up. Besides, we pay by credit card, even if it is 1 cent, we can pay. After our argument, she said that it would be okay to charge you 224.4 yuan. It's too much, just charge extra money casually. The impression of Lushan Hotel is poor. I suggest you choose other hotels. There are many hotels above anyway. The price is much cheaper than this. 
0	About Ctrip: Ctrip's ability to negotiate prices at Homeinn is doubtful. This time I booked a suite. The price was 289 through Ctrip. The retail price was not displayed online. After arriving at the front store of Home Inn, I found that the retail price was 299 yuan, and the price of Ctrip was only 10 yuan off. Later, a friend in Changzhou (lived next to Rujia) told me that if you book directly, you can easily get a discount of 240-250. In this way, I very much doubt Ctrip’s ability to negotiate prices. Booking through Ctrip is for the sake of economy, but the price obtained is 10 yuan lower than the published retail price. It has no price advantage at all, and even local friends can get the price comparison. Ctrip is cheaper, so what else do we use Ctrip for? Regarding the hotel: the suite facilities are too old, and it is inconsistent with the price of 289, especially the sofa in the living room on the first floor, which is simply the biggest flaw in the room. The gray-green sofa is really like a check out of the garbage dump. The suite is on the first floor and is a duplex structure on the upper and lower floors. There are no windows on the upper floor and windows on the lower floor. 1 meter outside the window is a high wall that can let in a little light, which feels like a basement. Slap mosquitoes in the room before going to bed, but no more than 20 dead. I have lived in many shops in Homeinn. This is the first time I have encountered this room. I don’t want to affect my mood when I travel. So I will complain again after I come back. I hope Homeinn and Ctrip can give feedback. 
1	"To be honest, I didn't know this book at all. Usually, Dangdang.com pays more attention to novels and children's literature. Novels are my favorite, and children's literature is my son's favorite. Recently, a friend recommended this book and ""Nian Lou Xue Short"". He is an elementary school Chinese teacher with a very high level of teaching. He said that this book will help children learn ancient Chinese. Each essay is very short, which is conducive to children's learning. After the sixth grade children read it, they like it very much. I like it myself, really, very good. I seem to feel the artistic conception of Chinese excellent classical literature as I read it. "
1	Cost-effective, the mold is very suitable for women, choose wine red. The match is very good! The combination of hardware is also relatively balanced! 
0	I placed an order for this book on October 3, and I have not received the book until now. I have complained several times. At the beginning, the customer service returned me a letter. Then there was no news. I feel that the competition is fierce. In the era, if you do customer service in this way, you will definitely be eliminated. When I have lost my confidence and complain again, I received an email from Dangdang today, let me comment, not seeing it and not worrying, since I have been invited , I have to say a few words. 
1	"I read this book at the company where I was interviewing. At that time, I was shocked that the ""book"" was not because it was difficult to read, but because I could read it clearly. It feels like I have entered the door of financial reports, and everything is waiting for me to discover. I am a journalist, and economic journalism is a difficult piece. However, Mr. Liu Shunren's articles are easy to understand, but they can also convey deep meaning. They especially emphasize ""quality, courage and responsibility"", which are rare in China. So I decided to show it to Dad after reading it. Haha recommended! "
0	I’ve blacked the screen once, but I don’t know the reason, and I can’t solve it if I can’t find the reason. Although there is no black screen now, I’m afraid of the future 
1	I have always believed that a healthy body is more important than anything else. Unfortunately, there are many misunderstandings in life that we don’t know. Reading this book carefully at the beginning, I found that many details that we usually ignore are actually affecting our health. Even if I was born in the Xinglin family, I would ignore many details, so I decided to slowly change some of the neglected bad lives. Habits. Thanks to the authors of this book for their contributions to our health, and I strongly recommend this book, which is really rare. 
0	The price of this hotel is quite different from the actual service provided. The heating is not hot enough, you need to wear sweaters, wool pants, and sometimes even quilts in the room. The rooms are small and the facilities are outdated. Advantages: very close to the railway station, it only takes about 5 minutes to walk. 
1	I bought it for my friend. He used it for a day and it felt good. Although the price is not as exaggerated as Jingdong said, it is really not expensive. The appearance and configuration are good. The hard drive is Hitachi, and no abnormal noise was heard. As for the fan, his air conditioner is turned on at 22 degrees, and the outer casing of the notebook is cool, so I didn’t hear the notebook sound, and I don’t know what it looks like when turned... Is it impossible to start and run normally for several hours? 
0	The content is too simple, repeating too many times that my son is one year old and five months old, obviously not interested in this. I prefer the Tom series. 
1	It is enough for daily office and entertainment, 3 USB ports, very convenient. Install the system and driver with an external optical drive, and it takes an hour to get it. 
1	Thin and light, good heat dissipation, and good workmanship. The price is actually cheaper than Zhongguancun, 4888-300=4588 yuan including tax in the village is basically this price 
0	The price is still a bit high, the configuration of the netbook is OK, but the entertainment performance is worse. As the Intel Menlow platform with ultra-low power consumption, the battery endurance needs to be strengthened 
0	I bought it after seeing how good it was. Why didn't my daughter like it and put it aside. Wouldn't it be bigger? Daughter is 2 and a half years old~ 
1	The ASUS brand is great, and the human face is good. It’s good to play games. After playing the official ASUS graphics card driver, the video memory will become 1G. 
0	Insufficient heat dissipation! ! System menswear! I don’t know how to recommend buying one with the system installed! Uninstall the ROOT HUB, enter the BIOS again, restore SET UP! OK, otherwise the USB is useless! 
0	Checked in the day before yesterday, I feel not as good as last time. I lived in the same room 2 years ago. Now the facilities are old, breakfast is also very poor, and the staff service in the parking lot is very poor. I will not choose to live here next time. It's not as comfortable as home! 
0	The general feeling is average, and the waiting time during checkout is too long and slow. . 
0	The whole book is about acupuncture points, at least it is not very practical for me, maybe it is useful for friends who like acupuncture points. 
0	Not as good as expected. It's just that all the questions are brought up, but there is not too much detailed explanation of the problems, which is a bit anticlimactic. 
1	Share good things! The son seldom takes out his love book to share with his children, but this time he will put the magic sticker on the bed and play a sticker game with a few good friends. The seaside and the fairy kingdom are all dreamy places for children. It is fun to play with children. The children themselves think that playing stickers like this is happier than playing by themselves! 
0	Qingdao is now recruiting a group of volunteers to find the wrong language in public places and goods. I think these volunteers may also be able to publish books! How can such books help people who learn English! Don't call me <笑死我的 English Book>, just call it <Laughing Dead Book>! 
1	"Nianwan, for his brother, I really love him! From beginning to end, I heard him call him ""brother"" once, but it was the last words before he died. I really feel sorry for him, and the author is really cruel! No matter how hard your heart is, just call him that, and you have to give him a good home! A funny essay was performed in a sad drama at the end, but it really happened. Pain is the only thing I feel when I see Nian Wan die. "
1	The delivery is very fast. The order was paid the previous day, and the goods arrived at the door in the next morning. The product is cost-effective. If it is usually just for chatting on the Internet, watching movies, and office work, it must be enough. 
0	Basically it's useless. I don't remember a few words after reading the book. I still have to memorize the words every day. Maybe I can't use this book or I'm too stupid? 
1	Perhaps only the person concerned can really feel the pain of the passing away. This book tells about the miss of her relatives after Aunt Mei passed away. Aunt Mei and her wife adopted a lonely little girl and two elderly themselves. They are not wealthy, they can even be said to be living in poverty, but they gave this girl the warmth of her family with all their love, and they did their best to care and take care of her without reservation. There is nothing in life like such selfless love What's more precious? Not one’s own life, but better than one’s own life, such a person has passed away, but will always live in the hearts of others! A very touching book. 
0	"I bought it after seeing so many hot reviews. At the same time, I bought ""The Wisdom Not Sick"" together. After reading this, I feel that compared with the two, this one is really not recommended. What I say is ambiguous and ambiguous. I will be emotional about Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and I will criticize the current Chinese medicine, and I will say how I am. I really don’t like this kind of author. I don’t have the spirit of great love. I only care about showing myself, I just want to lose this. Book! "
0	"My colleague and I have booked the ""Wudu Hotel"" for one night. We will enter the host at 6pm on August 1st, and we will not be able to open the door with a room card if we go out at 11pm on August 2nd. If the waiter opens the door, we must first check our identity. Certificate, I said that I had submitted the certificate when I entered the master, and now I have a room card and cannot enter the door, because the hotel service has a problem, why check my identity and then open the door. The lobby manager first quibbleed that there is no battery, I am the two of us It is unlikely that the room card will have no electricity at the same time, and it is also said that it is a security need during the Olympics. I said that we legally entered the host, and there was no violation of the law to check out on time. Besides, there is a national public security department that violates the law, so why restrict me Come and go freely within the valid check-in time. I hope Ctrip will give me a satisfactory answer. The hotel's attitude and service are very problematic! "
1	The location is good, in the bustling downtown area, it is very convenient to go to Tianjin Street and Qingniwa. There is a tram not far downstairs; I live in a mini-standard room, but it is bigger than I thought. There are 17, 8 flat bar; services and everything are pretty good, but I think it’s not good. Internet access is actually charged, 20 yuan/day, but I also have time and hope that it will be free in the future; TV can be received from Korea, Japan, the United States, and Hong Kong Waiting for the station, but some stations are not clear 
1	Cost-effective. . . Very high, this price can indeed be said to be the Shenzhou of the United States. . The system is indeed difficult to install, compared to those who don't know much, but basically the latest system disks can be installed directly. 
1	It’s really lazy to write reviews, but this book is really worth my taste. It’s been more than a year since I bought this book. My child has read this book countless times and he wants I told him over and over again, asking again and again what it was, I bought it for him, so he was most interested in the book. From this book, he learned a lot of things in daily life and enhanced his observation ability. You can see the very small details in the book. As a parent, he didn’t know many of the details originally, and he didn’t learn it. Less, really good value for money. 
0	Don’t live here during this time, they are noisy! Moreover, the prompt in the room said that the construction started at 8:30, and the structure started at 7:40. I asked them to solve it all morning, and it has not stopped until 8:30! By 8:30 they will be more reasonable and continue to start construction! 
0	Lanzhou...a city that I don’t want to come again. I stayed at Jinlun Hotel on the first day. I was not satisfied with it. Once again, I asked Ctrip to have a better one, which is also a four-star hotel. Called the best in Lanzhou and China, the worst four-star is none other than him...Check in at 10pm and go upstairs after the procedures are completed...Oh my God...no lights...I turned on the lights after touching for a long time, Because it was too late and I was a little tired, I thought of entering the house to rest. What I didn't expect was that the door card could not open the door. After tossing for a long time, I finally opened the door with the waiter's card. The parking lot is open, and the fee is still there. In other words, please check into the hotel you recommend personally, the president of Ctrip, or two words: shame 
1	"Hangzhou Xixi, a national wetland park, the 2008 Lunar New Year ""If You Are the One"" brought it to the people of the whole country. As a Hangzhou native, its emergence has not attracted much attention, because its predecessor was a water-net area full of fish ponds and fire persimmons. It was developed into a wetland park. It turns out that its history is so long, five thousand years old. History can really unearth a lot of humanities in any place. "
0	I only bought it when I saw the high evaluation of this book on the Internet. But after reading a few pages, I regretted buying this book. Can't stand it anymore. It's a waste of time. Looking at the author’s resume, I seem to be a pretty good person, but what is written in the book is the words of Che Yu. The same content is repeated over and over again in different languages, as if to cheat the manuscript fee. Rubbish. Now it’s on the shelf and I don’t want to look at it. 
1	After reading the trilogy, the night elves have done something ten thousand years ago and have understood a little bit. What are you talking about? The author's idea is actually quite good. Illidan's obsession with demon magic, the trend of the high elves, the birth of the druid. And why there are so few night elf men, there are answers in the book. Reading about the future of the blue dragon family is actually quite sad. In the next ten thousand years, these creatures will be on the verge of extinction. The dead blue dragons will later become frost dragons of natural disasters. Well written. 
1	By the way, I forgot to say, the foreigner's voice in the CD is very good! Chinese female voice is also very good! 
0	Rough workmanship. Especially the keyboard is incomparable with DELL and ThinkPad. This price can only be so, admit it. There is no built-in Bluetooth module. And if it is installed, a lot of things will be removed. 16:9 screen browsing the web feels too short. 
1	Checked in for the third time and felt it was pretty good. It happened to be hit by an earthquake, and the low floor was not obvious. I hope that Sichuan will recover from the disaster as soon as possible! 
1	The lobby is good, with a four-star appearance, the room facilities are average, it feels a bit old, the bathroom details are good, all kinds of supporting things are good, it feels okay, and if you have the opportunity to go to Mount Tai, you will have to stay. 
1	This is a small book about seal cutting of Zhejiang School. The content should not be bothersome and the key points are covered. Although the printed example shown is in black and white, readers may wish to understand the Zhepai system. The book especially demonstrates Zhao Cixian's evaluation, which strongly illustrates Zhao Zhiqian's theory of ingenuity and his narrow tolerance, arrogant mentality, and lack of cultivation. Zhao Zhiqian is an Indian who I admire, and he has made remarkable achievements in the late Qing Dynasty. But at this point, we don't have to hide from the sages. On the contrary, we should analyze objectively and return to the true colors of history. I think this is one of the highlights of this book. 
1	The environment of Friendship Hotel is absolutely first-class, and the service attitude is even more refreshing. Our family spent three wonderful days here, thank you for the good service of the hotel, and thank Ctrip for the accurate booking. The only shortcoming is that there is no service guide in the rooms of Friendship Hotel. Even if it is simple hints, such as restaurant location, dining time, price, etc., although the waiter can answer enthusiastically, it always feels inconvenient. Additional comments August 1, 2008: By the way, it is very convenient to go to the beach to swim. Just change your clothes in the hotel. Come back and take a warm bath, which is really comfortable. I will definitely choose here next time I go on holiday. 
1	1. The environment is good, not far from the Three Gorges Square, you can go to see beautiful women if you are bored 2. Breakfast, great! 3. Checkout is slower overall, it’s good 
0	Hello! I want to ask what I ordered on December 4th <Don't laugh! I am an English vocabulary book>Why hasn't it arrived yet? Isn't it in stock? Is it so long in delivery? 
1	The standard decoration of Home Inn is not to say, but it still has the same old problem as the one downstairs. The water temperature is indeed hot and cold, and the sound insulation is really bad. However, the price requirement can't be too much, but it shouldn't be difficult to get the water temperature next time.... 
0	In this hotel, the soundproofing is too poor and they are all separated by wooden boards. There is a pure drinking water port, but if it is broken, there is no free mineral water. The room setting is also bad. There is no water coming out of the shower in my colleague’s room. I advise everyone not to live. 
1	It is highly recommended. The system is powerful enough and the configuration is high enough. The price of the sony brand is relatively real. The workmanship and materials are very satisfactory. The price is good. 
1	I bought a few ThinkPads made by Lenovo. It feels similar to the old ThinkPad, and the quality is still relatively good. Plus Jingdong's return and exchange service, you are not afraid of quality problems when you buy large items. 
1	I booked the VIP building standard room (selected according to previous reviews). The biggest feature is that the service details are considered very thoughtful. Fruits, evening papers, napkin boxes, and even the stepping towels in front of the bathtub are laid out. Special note: Because the standard room of the VIP building of this hotel is close to the road, the rooms are divided into double-layer soundproof glass room and single-layer soundproof glass room. If you are sensitive to noise, it is recommended to book a double-layer soundproof glass room. 
0	The hotel is not like a five-star hotel, most of which is three-star standard. It is disappointing. The sea view of the two rooms can only see one corner, and there is no sense of service. We have forgotten things in both rooms. As a result, we arrived in Penglai and no one contacted we. I called and asked them to send it back, but they were all playing football. Depressed~~ 
1	After reading the child, I told her more than two times. She learned and used her life. She said she was going to become a bird. I think it’s more expensive, but it’s worth it. I hope the child will be more alike. Yes. Plug in the wings of imagination. 
1	Fingerprints and Bluetooth are available, and they are independent. The price is also the lowest on the market and very affordable. Home delivery is very convenient and assured. 
0	Apart from the hotel's location near the train station (50 meters), there is nothing remarkable about the hotel. The room is clean, but the equipment and area are not very cost-effective. The toilet in the bathroom is sometimes blocked; included in the room rate The breakfast buffet is even worse. Before the end of breakfast, all the plates are empty, only pickles and milk are left... will not stay again next time. 
1	"After reading this ""Job History Matching SHOW"", it gave me the feeling of deja vu. There should be some connection with Ruili Magazine, because this book is not much different from the ""Ruili"" I have read before, just "" ""Ruili"" has more advertisements, thicker but less price. Therefore, I think this book is priced at 30 yuan, and it is more expensive to sell for 20 yuan. The book is good, of course, the more important thing is personal learning experience. If a book is bought only as a collection, it is not worth it. "
0	The deluxe standard room booked at a price of 738 yuan, the same comparison has been the worst. The surrounding environment is nothing but a subway entrance, restaurants are not good, and there is no food around. The room is small, I stayed for two days and there was no water for one night. The broadband charge was 40, and printing contributed dozens of RMB 10. Absolutely worthless. 
1	The appearance is good, in fact, it has always been unfavorable for Lenovo, but when Lenovo finally changed its previous dull and all-black shape, I was moved. I admit that Lenovo did break out this year. LED backlight, DDR3, and GT130 are all currently relatively high specifications! ! 
1	The machine's craftsmanship and design are very good. Although it is a 12-inch wide screen, it is still very light and thin, and the ThinkPad is still the same. 
1	At first I was moved by this story, so I bought this book. I just got this book. I didn't like the pictures very much. I felt indescribable. It was a bit like an over-exposed photo. I was worried that the child would not like it. So, I first tried not to tell her the book before going to bed, but the little guy was attracted to this story at once and liked it very much. I had to tell this story every day from the next day. Very interesting. You can also make a small game. The gray-robed grandma's robes and nature blend into the same color in the painting, and you need a little bit of eye to find it. Let's test the kids. 
0	This author's book is really ordinary. Unless you have cross-experience with her, it is difficult to find the feeling. Delicate is the strength of the Japanese, but it is ordinary and not moving. 
1	I ordered yesterday, and I mentioned it today. The price protection is in place. Yesterday I set it at 4,999 yuan. Today, the price protection is reduced by 100 yuan, which is enough to buy a 1G memory stick. 
1	Now that I have finished reading the book, I am always moved by the ubiquitous friendship and family. I sighed for the cowardice of the young Amir; sighed for the experience of the young Hassan; I felt lucky for people like Uncle Rahim Khan to treat Amir; I would have fallen to the United States without charity and would rather suffer and suffer and support Amir's studies. And moved; Amir, who grew up, mustered the courage to be moved by what Hassan's son did. I was moved by everything in the book, as if I lived/grew up with Amir, faced the past struggles together, and finally became a courageous person like a father. 
0	"I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad. Dandong also stayed on the 20th floor of the International Hotel. This time I chose this so-called only four-star hotel in Dandong because of business, but I have never seen a hotel with such poor service quality. Enemies with guests everywhere. I checked in on the 14th. Since I was on a flight at 11pm on the 16th, at noon on the 15th, I asked the front desk if I could charge a total of two and a half days for the room at 6pm on the 16th. The front desk agreed at the time and swiped my two and a half days of advance payment. But wait until 6:2 pm on the 16th, comrades, after two minutes, they actually want to charge me for three days' room. At that time, I was patient and explained to the two waiters at the front desk. Later, a female assistant manager with glasses also came over. It can be said that the hotel computer system will automatically lock for one day after six o'clock. The deputy manager later called to ask Manager Chen for instructions. I stood by and heard the details with my own ears. She just said that a guest wanted to check out after six o'clock and asked for a long time, okay? After getting the negative answer, she raised her head and rejected herself. I told her: ""You call for instructions? You talked to your manager on the phone and told me the fact that you agreed on the 15th?"" She was asked to stop! Because I was in a hurry, I didn't bother to argue with them. I advise Ctrip not to sign another housing contract with this hotel, lest it attract more complaints. "
0	The hotel is very partial, and the environment is deserted in a development zone far from the city. The front desk service is poor. When I checked in, the two reception ladies were busy. But after one was finished, he saw me standing in front of the stage and didn't know to greet him, but went to help the other. A guest from the back came in and squeezed directly beside me, yelling to check in, and the lady immediately went to help him check in. Instructed how she didn't know how to make guests line up, but she didn't respond. The Chinese restaurant of the hotel is in another building. It was all booked for a wedding that day, so I could only go out to find a place to eat. 
1	After receiving the book, I found that although the book has only 190 pages, the words are smaller and more compact than the Golden Game (1), so the word count is actually much more, and the content is richer. The quality is far from those of fast-food books. It is highly recommended. I admire Hao's personality and share it with you selflessly in the daily blog, and sincerely thank Hao. 
1	Just looking at the Sina serialization was too laborious, and finally couldn't bear to buy a copy of Dangdang. I want to continue to appreciate this great book! ! 
1	Nice hotel, the decoration and style are very good, it is the best hotel in Zhengzhou. Unfortunately, there is no time to stay well, because it is half past one in the evening. I drove away at 8:30 in the morning, so I just think the room is very comfortable. The breakfast is delicious hahahaha......... 
1	For the hotel I stayed at this time, I feel very good, because I am very concerned about the environment, I will check the reviews every time I stay at the hotel, so I chose this hotel, the place is also very easy to find, we stayed in room 395, But they gave us a room worth 888 for us to experience. It was so comfortable. The breakfast was worth 88 yuan. It was rich and really amazing. I highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!! 1 
1	It's not bad in Taiyuan, personally think it is better than Shanxi Hotel! I have never lived in China World Trade Center, the price is too expensive, ha ha 
0	Why did the price decrease as soon as I bought it! I bought it at 3999. When I look back, it is already 3966. It's a bit like buying stocks. 
1	Road repairs near the hotel, travel is more painful. The service is still good as always. Occasionally I went to the gym, I feel so small, the equipment is crowded, and the others are good. BTW: The restaurant has gold and silver cards for discounts. ~ 
0	It's far worse than expected, and there is nothing to move. The language is plain and the characters are pale. In short, I can't understand those who say this book is moving. 
0	It seems that the sound of the fan is a bit loud, which may be due to the longer usage time. If it can be equipped with a bag, the mouse will be fine. I have to buy it myself. Besides, there is no random CD, how to restore the system? 
0	I just came back from Jiuhua Mountain and booked the Baisui Villa from Ctrip. The general feeling is okay, but the hall is filled with wonderful fragrance, I don't know what it is, it is a bit pungent. The room is OK, very compact, and the facilities and bath water are good, but there is a strange smell of dampness and not ventilation, and there are traces of uncleanness on the sheets. Fortunately, if we only bet for one day, it will be done. 
1	The location is very good, very close to Dongjiekou, and the service is very good. Someone was guided to the room all the way to make oolong tea. There is a computer in the room, and the wife can use it when I go out to work during the day. Apart from the slightly outdated furniture and facilities, the hotel has no shortcomings except that the breakfast is relatively ordinary. At night, many people of all kinds run to the nightclub on the 6th floor, and many people come out drunk. The hotel has only recently been upgraded to 4 stars, but I still feel that it is still not up to the new 4-star standard, but at least it is worth the price. Additional comments July 27, 2008: Same as the following comment, the waiter will take the initiative to take my own laundry to the balcony to dry, and leave a note, like it. 
0	The quality of this book is not good. When I bought it, there were pages 146-179 broken in the book. I wanted to give it away right away, but I had to return all of the books, which wasted our time. 
1	Many young people in modern times like to read those feminine prose and disdain folklore works. In fact, folklore and customs are the root of our Chinese culture. No matter how beautiful the flowers are, they must be supported by roots. Taihu Lake is really the hometown of tea culture, even the Japanese tea ceremony originated in China. What's more, the tea scriptures of tea saint Lu Yu were also written in Taihu Lake. The Huiquan landscape by the Taihu Lake once asked Li Deyu, the prime minister of the Tang Dynasty, to send Kuaima from Wuxi to Chang'an just like Yang Guifei’s Thousand Miles of Litchi, just to make tea and taste tea. The tea customs of Taihu Lake have really influenced China for thousands of years. You deserve this book. 
0	The room is too old, the bathroom is a lot of rust, the room is relatively large, the big bed is good, I like it. The price is okay, but it is too old and uncomfortable. The level of the waiter is almost the level of the old state-run company 20 years ago. Next time I will live in another house. But it is said that the lady is good, I did not try. 
1	I chose the big bed room (it has just been renovated, the house still has a smell of decoration); the facilities in the house are the same as the bachelor's apartment, which is not bad. The bed is also more comfortable, but it may be that my skin is stingy, and the bedding is a bit hard; and the double bed room is the same as the non-staff rooms, all of which are out of the security door: ((According to the waiter, there are only two double rooms on each floor , The other is noisy facing the street) But fortunately, there is a balcony at the door, which feels isolated, but there is still a small space. Generally speaking, the price is good! 
0	The workmanship is still thin, and the whole keyboard board feels a little sinking when the keyboard is pressed down. The battery is far from reaching the 9.5 hours advertised. I wonder if it hasn't been activated yet. 
0	It's heavier. It's about the same weight as my original S6130. The screen is very thick. A piece of glass is added to the outside of the LCD screen for handwriting. The rest of the left hand is hot here. 
0	The memory is too small, the standard 2G is just fine, and the video 130W is a bit small, so blurry! Installing XP is a bit numb, no XP driver! Trouble! 
1	The appearance is large, the configuration is high, the overall design is relatively reasonable, and the cost performance is high, especially for men. 
1	"""Listening to Yang Jiang and Talking about the Past"" can be regarded as Yang Jiang's personal biography, and reading it through can deepen the understanding of Mr. Yang Jiang. From Yang Jiang's life, we can understand how a generation of literary masters stick to themselves, how she and Mr. Qian Zhongshu stick to their positions, and at the same time, we can also understand the fate of their times. After reading this book, what made me feel the most is the difficult mood of Mr. Yang Jiang when facing Qian Zhongshu and Qian Yuan at the same time. When Qian Yuan passed away, she was both mourning and sorrowful, but she also wanted to hide Qian Zhongshu from the news, which was really moving... "
0	I checked every book carefully when I received the goods, and I was very happy when I got it alive, and the packaging felt good, worth 9 yuan. After reading it in two or three hours in one breath, I found out that the book was a book. This book is not worth collecting, just take a look 
0	strange. . This one is really strange. . Obviously there is a mouse in the packing list. Wiping the mirror cloth, opening the box but nothing. . . Strange. It should be said that there will be no such problems 
1	The overall feeling is similar in this price configuration. The main reason is that the template is more refined, the battery life is strong, the hard drive is larger, etc. ViewSonic meets these conditions 
0	I bought this so-called best-selling book for the first time. I wanted to be educated. Maybe there are too many books on philosophy. I feel that the author’s writing is very brainless and plain as water... a good book, or it can be received Inspiring, let people learn to think, or be purely pragmatic. This book reads something that a little girl wrote. It is neither long-learned nor pragmatic. It is purely on paper and relatively superficial. It is not worth reading. In other words None of my books can fit on my bookshelf. Reading such books is a waste of time. 
0	"As a 5-star hotel, the price is more than 400 yuan, and the price/performance ratio is too bad. There were no small shoehorns or bathrobes in the room, but there were two small flying insects flying in the bathroom and cracks in the water bucket. It was not like a five-star hotel at all. The foreman at the front desk looked cold. The facilities in the hotel have been evaluated by others and will not be published anymore. According to Ctrip's website, ""Taicang Garden Hotel also has a full range of fitness and entertainment facilities and supporting services."" This is indeed the case. From the appearance of the hotel, the main business of the hotel may be here. "
0	I just had a child before and I read a book of Karl Witt’s education, and I felt that it was much better than this book. I turned it over and threw it aside. 
0	When the disc is read at high speed, there is a slight trembling sound; it is inconvenient to add memory. It is necessary to remove the entire 2/3 of the back cover and tighten 10 screws 
0	"After reading it, I think it's very general. But it has not yet reached the level that requires so many people to criticize Yu Dan. Philosophy is the knowledge of ""the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom"". Everyone has their own opinions, so it is normal to criticize. Yu Dan became famous too quickly, and the Chinese have a bad habit of ""to irritate others, but not to laugh at others"", so criticism is normal. Intellectuals in ancient times emphasized ""safe and happy, not be surprised, indifferent to fame, quiet and far-reaching."" They can use the doctrine of sages to preach. Selling books and seeking profit may not be in line with the values of being a scholar, so criticism is normal. However, I can understand. "
0	I really don’t know why the book has been ranked high. This is the history book I have read. The writing level and grammar are the worst! ! ! Can't comment on bad ones. Novels are not like novels, biographies are not like biography, prose is not like prose, official history is not like official history, and joking is not like joking.....I want to learn Yi Zhongtian, but not like gods, but I want to learn Guo Degang. I lack a sense of humor... It's all because the author is inferior to middle school students, and the seemingly gorgeous words are constantly being piled up...I wonder if other readers feel the same? 
0	Warmly tell everyone, don’t stay here anymore. Turn off the air conditioner at 11 o’clock in the evening. There will be a signal for a while after the Internet. Breakfast is average, and the price is not low. It is the worst hotel I have ever booked. 
0	An Analects of Confucius, which contains a wide range of rigor and profoundness, has become beautiful and gorgeous under Dan's interpretation, and the gray dogma has become a gorgeous literary feast. 
0	This book can be used as an example, to inspire dreams, say goodbye to the monotonous life over and over again, find the journey of self, and then discover the beauty of life and the tranquil inner world. It is a book that brings energy, I like it! 
1	Trace the source, specify the detailed source, provide abundant evidence, and show the meaning and usage of each allusion. This dictionary is a new member of the big family of Chinese dictionaries. Each entry in the dictionary includes three parts: semantics, source of allusions and examples. English allusions are an important part of the English language and cultural treasure house. They are the accumulation of national culture and the crystallization of national wisdom. Allusions have profound meanings and strong national colors, and have a strong rhetorical effect. English allusions are composed of various forms and extremely wide sources .Knowing and being familiar with some common English allusions helps us understand the culture and customs of English-speaking countries 
0	Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation Very beautiful design, great heat dissipation 
1	Celebrating the 11th anniversary of the 14-inch book limit gold medal snapped up 2999 yuan! Such a price, such a lovely book, what else is there except excitement 
1	Checked in with a friend on January 28, the hotel front desk felt a little shabby, a bit like an old-fashioned guest house. I lived in a deluxe standard room on the 2nd floor of Building 1. You can feel that the room is very old, but the bed and sofa are very comfortable, and the bathroom has been renovated and is of a 4-star class. Open the curtains, the scenery outside the house is very good. Because there is no breakfast in the hotel, there is no concept of this item. In Yangshuo, this hotel is indeed the best, and its environment and rooms are completely beyond the comparison of those hotels on West Street ranging from tens to hundreds of yuan. What was particularly moving was that when I checked in, due to the large snowfall in southern China, the power supply was short, and the whole city of Yangshuo was out of power. In addition to using its own generator to generate electricity in time, the waiter also went outside to buy a new heater. Warm us up and help us debug again and again. In all fairness, if judged by the waiters who have undergone a complete set of western hotel etiquette training in those five-star hotels in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the waiters of Bailelai seem to be not professional enough, but their service gives people a very authentic and intimate feeling. (Perhaps I didn't encounter a bad waiter) It is recommended that the friends staying in have more understanding and don't be too picky with the mentality that the customer is God. Of course, if there are indeed problems, they still have to be raised. Besides, when I went there, I heard that Building 6 was being renovated. After the renovation, the hardware facilities should be improved. 
1	"For Wang Daming, I personally feel that he is not very familiar with officialdom, except that he has some means to deal with Ding Shengxian. Others did not feel that they could be the director. Just betting Chen Weiyang is somewhat related to the subject of ""gambling"". The storyline is not as ""step by step"" as the Microsoft theme, but the theme will be well centered at that time. In the whole book, I like the profile description of Guo Tianbao very much. I personally feel that if I write from Guo Tianbao's work, if he writes well, it may be quite successful. These are purely personal views. Haha "
1	The price/performance ratio is really high, the workmanship is average, but it is definitely acceptable relative to the price, and my hard drive is a Western Digital hard drive, there is no stall phenomenon~ I am lucky~ 
0	I booked a standard room of 180. When I arrived, I said that some meeting rooms were full, and the room I booked was gone. It was too credible. Ugh! Will never live again next time. 
1	I had set it elsewhere, but it happened to see 4699 here this weekend, which was a lot cheaper, and I won it immediately. Self-examination, the packaging is not opened, the screen is perfect, not bad. The machine is quite PP, the heat dissipation is better than expected, the LED screen is beautiful, and the HDMI support is basically smooth 
1	Checking in for the second time, the hotel has a free pick-up service, and free iced drinks after getting in the car. The hotel staff is very friendly, no matter which department you are in, you will take the initiative to smile and greet you. The room facilities are a bit old, there is no safe in the room, the TV is a very old 21-inch spherical picture tube, the big bed is still very comfortable, the deluxe single room I live in has 14 windows, and it takes two minutes to draw the curtains. The area is huge. The ventilating fan and ceiling light in the bathroom are on the same switch, but if you turn on the ventilating fan when you take a bath, you may feel a little cold. It is recommended to split into two switches. The breakfast is very rich, and the fruit plate is delivered on the first day. Bailuzhou is nearby. It only takes ten minutes to walk there, and the scenery is very good. Although the hardware settings are lacking, I will definitely live again next time. 
0	A very bad experience. After I booked the room with Ctrip, the service staff actually asked for my ID card. I have lived in the United States for 10 years. I have no ID card for a long time. Fortunately, the passport is barely accepted. 
1	"After reading this set of books, as a Chinese, I am very painful. Why is there such a big gap between China and the United States? Why are so many Chinese people rejecting democracy and defending the corrupt Chinese bureaucracy? In times of pain, I also see a hope that people can truly have freedom and democracy without being enslaved. Chinese people should have a belief, ""It is a black cloud that blocks the stars from shining, and black clouds cannot block the stars forever."" If you want to read, this set of books will be a set of books that you will never regret after reading. "
0	Today is June 27th, more than 2 months before my stay at Hanting Express Hotel (Shanghai New Hongqiao) (I stayed on April 12th), I have no memory of other things, but the trouble caused by checkout after leaving the hotel I have troubled me so far. On that day, I booked two superior double rooms for RMB 246 through Ctrip. The total price was RMB 492. At that time, all the check-in procedures went smoothly. The waiter took out the Ctrip order and used the card in an orderly manner. I took the order and signed. Of course, I paid attention to the card to sign the order. The pre-authorization was 800 yuan. The waiter did not check every other receipt issued by the waiter. I left the store to check out the next day. Trouble came. When I swiped the card again to sign the bill, I found that I had swiped 568 yuan and I refused to sign the bill. It was different from my booking. At this time, the waiter took out my receipt from yesterday and said, I live in a superior double room with a price of 284 yuan. I feel dizzy. I was not careful yesterday. Yesterday I didn’t have any tips. I asked to pay the bill today. I talked to the waiter. Finally, the service supervisor agreed to settle the bill at 492 yuan. It was over, but it was not the case. The waiter swiped my card twice, one time was 492 yuan, I agreed to sign the bill to him, and the other was 568 yuan. I refused to sign and took back the bill. However, when I received the bank statement, I still found that the payment was deducted twice. I called the hotel and gave a reply after agreeing to the inquiry. I haven’t received any reply so far, and then I contacted the bank. The bank contacted the bank, and the bank finally returned 492 yuan on June 13 (it is estimated that the bank had N negotiations with the store). Around June 25, the bank called me to return 492 yuan. I checked the situation and reported it to the bank again. , It should be returned 568 yuan, once again I said that the bill that I did not sign is still deducted, I am waiting for the result of the bank negotiation. I don't know how long to wait this time-------------------- 
0	Looking at both sides, the first impression is-very average. In terms of content, I really disagree. I am still known as an academic star. The opinions of Comrade Yu Dan really made me insightful! The number of pages can be compressed to 50 pages, so why waste paper? Didn’t Confucius teach you how to do environmental protection? This concludes the comment, too lazy to waste my pen and ink! 
1	Stayed for two days on June 17, booked a semi-sea view room. It was raining on the day I went. Because I was not familiar with it, I took the subway to Sheung Wan Station and walked for more than 20 minutes. The reception attitude at the front desk was very good. Unfortunately, he said that the sea view room was full and could not be upgraded. It was a pity. Half sea view room with floor-to-ceiling windows, you can see the sea, but it is very close to residential buildings. The room is relatively clean, the bed is relatively large, and the room is a bit small compared to China, but it is said that a room of this size in Hong Kong is already very good. The hotel service is in place. Take the hotel’s free shuttle bus to take us to the Hong Kong and Macau Ferry Terminal. Only my husband and I, the driver is very nice. When you go out and turn left, you can sit in a car and the traffic is fairly convenient. And later I learned that the hotel is very close to the University of Hong Kong. I could go for a walk in the University of Hong Kong, but I might live again next time I have the opportunity. After reading other people's reviews, I found that the price of 678 is relatively high. Ctrip seems to have no advantage in price. 
0	I bought 4 books, and after reading the first one, I gave away all of them. I really don't like it. This book has several major drawbacks: 1. The author has been writing about officialdom struggles that intrigue me, swindle and kill people, but unfortunately I have no interest in this. I would rather go to see some more humane things like the secret history of the harem. 2. The narrative sequence is chaotic. At first glance, I realized that it was something written on the Internet, over and over again, and over and over again. After reading it, I couldn't figure out which thing came first and what happened after. 3. Poor writing. The author probably got the true biography of a certain martial arts novelist. His writing is pale, and only countless exclamation marks are unforgettable. I don’t understand why this book is sought after, whether I like its writing style, or the human fighting skills it introduces. The person who asked me for the book said it was for her son who is in high school. , Afraid of misleading children. 
1	There are so many different books about how pregnant women raise their babies, but the most attractive part of this book is the introduction of pregnancy and childbirth knowledge in stages, which can prepare fathers and mothers who are going to upgrade. The book not only introduces the dietary needs of pregnant women, but also elaborates on the life precautions of expectant fathers and mothers. Fetal protection is the first step in cultivating a baby. It is worthwhile to buy such a book that introduces the baby’s growth and maternity knowledge in detail. Dangdang's service is fast and high-quality, and the price of the book is relatively affordable. Thank you Dangdang! 
1	Snapped up at a special price. . The price/performance ratio is very high. . . The machine doesn’t work either, it also comes with a genuine operating system 
1	The service should be improved again. How come you have to meet the five-star standard? 
0	1. Not as powerful as imagined, especially the graphics card! 2. It's useless to have such a broken system with such a configuration. The new machine is not fast to use. How can I bear it! But this cannot be blamed on Jingdong, only ASUS! 
0	If the connection between the screen and the fuselage is designed to be chelated, there are some gaps now, if there is IBM's rigorous workmanship, it will be more perfect 
0	I have been using Ctrip for so many years. This time I was so disappointed and embarrassed. I wanted to stay in the best hotel, but it turned out to be a big hit. The hotel is built in a residential area, and the surrounding environment can be imagined. Know. It's been almost half a year since it opened, and it's still in the trial period. The rooms are ok, and the bathroom is terrible. The drain is not smooth, the shower room is estimated to be only one square meter, and there is no place for shampoo, and the bathroom is small Poor, I sit on the toilet, with my left shoulder resting on the shower room and my right shoulder resting on hygiene 
0	I don’t know if it’s an example. The keyboard is empty. Go to ASUS to repair it and glue it with double-sided tape. The keyboard will slosh when I press it down. ? ? 
1	The rooms are ok, and the furnishings are different from those of other hotels; the geographical location is in the center of Tsuen Wan, near the subway, and the access is ok; the night is near for snacks and snacks; the surrounding environment is quieter and safer at night, and there are many residential buildings nearby; You can consider it next time you go, 500 a few words, OK. Of course, for example, the heart is bad, but at least the room is medium (such as the heart's room is large and new). 
1	Staying during the Spring Festival, cost-effective, not bad, but I don’t know how much it usually costs. It is well-known in Chengdu and it is more worthy to live, but the room is too small and looks old. It may have something to do with the original design. The entrance is one-way Tao is not very convenient, if the price is still so pleasant, I will choose next time. 
1	The performance is good. The CPU, motherboard, memory, inherited graphics card, screen, and keyboard size are all improved compared to the X61. Originally, I am very disgusted with the widescreen, but after using it, I feel that the widescreen view is more comfortable than the 43 screen. The CPU of P8400 is very powerful, and the memory speed of DDR3 is almost double the speed of DDR2667 of X61. 
0	The facilities are old, the bathroom is really dirty and there is no elevator 
0	The content is empty, and everyone knows the truth. It's not worth buying, you can go to the bookstore if you have nothing to do, don't waste the money 
0	1 The room is very small, the carpet is very dirty, and the white towels are black. 2 The central air conditioner makes an abnormal noise, so I had to turn it off in the middle of the night. 3 The bath water is hot and cold. 
0	The hotel is next to the railway, fire at night 
0	1. I have used many methods to make a USB boot disk, but it can’t boot from the USB disk. 2. The computer heats up quite badly 3. The touchpad is not as easy to use as other brands, how can the sensitivity be adjusted? 4. The screen resolution is relatively low. No bag 5. The color of the keyboard letters is not prominent, so find the keyboard trouble. 
1	The appearance is good, and the express communication is relatively timely. I haven't tested the game, I usually use it normally, the hard disk sound is not too loud, and the heat generation is reasonable. 
1	Feeling distressed for this man. I love his talents and his experience is painful. Maybe it's Tian jealous of talents. Almost all talented people are destined to let him go on a flat and bumpy road. Everyone wants to be smart, and I was mistaken for my whole life by being smart. Hope that the child is stupid and stupid, and will come to the public without disaster. When writing these, I am afraid that my heart is full of sorrow. Although he hasn't been there, even at the ends of the world, the people around him will admire him for his talents, but his political ideals are still not realized. It is unfulfilled. Perhaps this is the hero's greatest tragedy... 
1	It looks very big and beautiful. It has a small keyboard. It is very convenient to enter numbers and has good heat dissipation. Compared with the notebook I bought last year, the original one cannot be seen. 
0	They are all acupuncture points of Chinese medicine, which seem to be very useful when seen, but they are not. I don’t know how this book became popular. It’s not very usable. 
1	The workmanship is very good, relatively fine, the appearance is stylish and thin, the startup speed is relatively fast, the Internet speed is also fast, 160G space is enough for general software use, completely practical, and very cost-effective 
1	Personally, I think this book is the author's refinement and summary of the previous book. After reading it, I knew what the financial business was all about. Financial quotient is a combination of several abilities, they are indivisible, not a single ability. After reading it, you will have a clear goal for your life situation and what to do next. If you are not satisfied with your current life and you want to change, then it is very important to improve your financial quotient. Start to change from learning. Hope to communicate with more rich dad fans! QQ: 383161223 (Note: Dangdang) 
0	The disadvantages are as follows: 1. The seam of the shell at the right palm rest is not tight; 2. The upper and lower parts of the book are aligned after being closed; 3. The cpu is 60nm, which is a new product last year. 4 Partitioning is more troublesome 
0	There are two shortcomings: 1: The fan is noisy. The fan keeps running from the moment it is turned on to when it is turned off (feeling out the air vent with your hands, sometimes the cool breeze is blowing) I don't know if it is a problem with the setting or the fan. 
1	The location of the hotel is good and very convenient. Best of all, there is Bada Airlines next door. There is a BUS from Luoyang to Xinzheng Airport in Zhengzhou. It is very convenient. The latest flight departs from Luoyang at 2:30 pm. The hotel room is nice, but it smells, and I can’t stand it: (If this problem is not solved, I really don’t want to live in it next time. Not to mention the price has no advantage. 
0	Too noisy. The service is not good. The room is not soundproof. It's not good anyway. Will not live anymore. . 55555555 
1	My baby is 1 week and 10 months, but I think this set of books will definitely grow with him. This is a set of teaching children how to express and manage their mood and emotions. When faced with all kinds of life, what kind of mood and mentality should be used to deal with things. My child likes it very much. He can tell what the bunny said or expressed his feelings when something happened in the book, so as to educate the child on the daily life. The paper quality of the book is very good, the color is clear, and the three-dimensional effect is strong. Let the children touch the plush and white hair on the bunny with their hands. They are very happy. The children like reading very much. 
0	Never stayed in such a bad hotel. First, you cannot swipe your card. Moreover, the quality of service is extremely poor. When I first arrived, I arranged that the room was not cleaned. After the arrangement, it was still not cleaned. Only the third time was cleaned. I called Ctrip and wanted to change hotels. Ctrip told me that when I booked the hotel, I promised to pay if I didn’t check in (the room was tense). I had no choice but to live. I didn’t understand. So many rooms were left empty and not cleaned. Yeah. After completing the formalities, the front desk told me that the elevator was broken. I climbed up to the fifth floor with three big bags. The bellman, the security guard, and the waiter didn't care when they saw it. I guess they were still smiling. At breakfast the next day, it was found that three people, including this talent, were eating, and the food on the dining table was enough for ten people. On the grounds that the room is tight, ask for payment for no-show? The hotel lacks due honesty. Later, a person from Ctrip's customer service called me at four times the speed of speech. It was estimated that they were talking about tongue twisters before, but they were hardly heard. The main meaning is that the manager of the hotel will personally apologize to me for the problem during check-in, but no one ever asked me until I checked out. I do not recommend visiting this hotel if I spurt blood. 
0	Linux is pre-installed to save costs. Changing the system is a little troublesome. The keyboard does have a problem of insufficient response, and the keys need to be pressed hard (but it may be because the new notebook is not willing to press hard). It may be that the graphics card is too bad, and the effect of playing games is not ideal. 
1	"Just like the title, if you want to give Wang Xiaobo a name, it is better to call him ""a maverick pig."" Wang Xiaobo has always been a controversial writer, but you have to admit that his unparalleled talent is different. Yu Secular even has some shocking views and ideas. He is a writer who thinks with pen and thinks with life. It is really a happy and painful thing to read his words and feel the weight of life. Well, let’s not say much, walk into Wang Xiaobo’s spiritual home and see what he thinks and how he lives. "
0	Everyone's views may be different. Maybe I was still outside the wall and didn't bother to read the book. I also bought it after listening to a friend's introduction. After I got it, I found it meaningless. Couples or couples have their own stories and characteristics in each family. I think it just needs to be diligent. . . . 
1	It does have the characteristics of a business hotel, but it lacks thoughtful five-star service. 
1	High cost performance, Compaq acquired by hp is taking the low-end entertainment route, with 512 alone, not bad! The touch screen is integrated, I like it! 
1	This is Ariel’s school diary, but the very tightly arranged New Yorker’s life is so fulfilling to read it through. You will feel that this girl is more real and closer to our lives than on TV and imagined. Ariel’s desire for new knowledge and expectations for a new life make me feel that reading is really a very happy and exciting thing! Sure enough, you should always read some books that can motivate yourself~ Although many people say that many of the stars' books are ghostwriting, I think that such a real feeling, how can it be ghostwriting! Support Ariel-because of your text! 
0	I arrived in Shangrao at night and called the hotel to ask for directions. I had a bad attitude and always pointed the wrong way. It took a long time to find the hotel in Shangrao. After checking in, the room was small and not very clean. The toilet is dirty. The boiler doesn't even have an indicator light. I will definitely not stay here next time. 
0	For this book, it is really well written! But how do you say Dangdang is an exclusive launch, there are many free online! I don’t know if I’m too stupid or a copyright issue! 
0	The writing is mediocre, the writing is mediocre, the historical materials are not detailed, the online reviews are exaggerated, and the amateur authors are playing a ticket. It is not recommended to buy, just download it! 
0	It’s very general, it’s difficult to say, some words are very simple, what HAND, ANGRY. Say it is simple, many words are difficult, what funeral parlor beautician, otolaryngologist, etc., anyway, I don’t understand now. Remember, what you understand is what you understand. Generally speaking, nothing interesting 
0	Very general, it would be even better if you can exemplify words in simple sentences, especially those emotional words! 
1	The workmanship is not bad, the keyboard is also very good, the heat dissipation is quite good, the fan sound is not very big, can accept the C drive more than 220 G D drive 10G F drive is 1G I sweat it can be solved with ADDS, it will not affect the pre-installed operating system 
0	I cut the price by 100 as soon as I bought it. I'm depressed. The price protection doesn't work. . . The workmanship is okay. The ati4330 is 64bit if it is 128. 
1	Candidates who have signed up for catti should choose the real questions over the years to understand and grasp the type and difficulty of the next questions. At present, there seems to be real questions in this version on the market. There are four sets of test papers in the book. However, the number of reading articles is different from today's test. Now this year's comprehensive ability reading test only has five articles of medium length and difficulty. The real questions in the book are relatively simple, and simulations are difficult. The difficulty of this year's actual exam is between the real questions and the difficulty of the simulation. The book is worthy of the exam's reference choice for students. There are detailed answers after each set of questions. 
0	It’s too common sense. People with a little English foundation will not make these mistakes 
0	The hotel staff is more s-board, maybe we use Ctrip, but we won’t go anyway! ! ! Hotel feedback July 24, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for your comments. I hope that at your convenience, comments and suggestions will be reflected to the hotel's lobby assistant manager. We will try our best to improve, thank you! 
0	This hotel is not 5 stars at all, it is a lie, their service and equipment are the worst, especially the service attitude is extremely bad, please don't stay in this hotel. 
0	To be honest, I bought this book to follow the trend and follow the trend. I regretted it when I bought it. Hehe, maybe I don’t like this kind of woman’s historical perspective. 
0	The built-in driver software disk under XP system environment cannot run automatically, it needs to be installed in the disk one by one. Some software is installed without knowing its purpose. The color does not seem to be bright enough (but it may also be a problem with my settings). The sound of the optical drive is a bit loud. 
1	This is the hotel where I live in Taiyuan with a good price/performance ratio, but the waiter asked for a quilt alone last time I checked in. The smell is extremely bad, it is not commensurate with the hotel, and there is no breakfast.It is recommended that Ctrip consider coordinating with the hotel. 
1	In short, the first sentence is cheap~ Let colleagues help install the XP system, it works well~ 
1	I bought it for my daughter, and I don’t know where she learned about this book. I read it by the way and it was very interesting. The health knowledge I talked about was also very useful. Since reading this book, I have been paying attention to my own poo and I am also responsible for my health. The funny thing is that every time everyone is making dumplings together, I will use the dough to make the healthiest poop look described in the book, and then tell everyone that if your poop looks like this, it means you are It's healthy. Unfortunately, most adults don't have this kind of poop, but children do. 
0	I found it while reading. This book is not as exciting as the website introduces, and the content is not funny, it just mentions other people's illnesses. Nothing is funny. . . . . Really depressed! 
0	The area of the standard room is too small, and the bathroom cannot be turned around. Room service is average, but fortunately, the attitude is acceptable after the call. It is commendable that its coffee shop has a good environment and the Chinese restaurant tastes good. 
0	Asking before check-in was good, but my friend said that the shower head in the room was very small and leaking, and it was noisy to sleep. I asked to check out the next day, maybe it was a different service staff, the attitude was very poor 
0	Very bad service attitude, very poor sound insulation, even on high floors, there is a sound of trains at night, moved to Yuanzhou International the next day 
1	It has been used for a week and the performance is good. The heat dissipation is also ok, better than expected. The screen is also perfect. 
1	Have stayed in this hotel several times and feel very good. The waiters are friendly and professional. The guest rooms are stylish and comfortable, with complete supporting facilities and easy to use. In short, it is a good choice to live in Sofitel when you come to Zhengzhou. 
1	Even in Shanghai, it is a very good hotel. Although the price is high, I feel that it is worth the price. This time I am very sorry that I came to Huangshan without seeing anything. I will definitely come again next time, and I will definitely stay in Beihai next time! ! ! ! 
0	This book may have been written in a foreign format. I personally feel that it is not attractive enough. It is not as interesting as domestic children's books and does not adapt to China's national conditions. 
1	Go to the self-pickup point and take it back and take it apart. The notebook is small in size, the six-cell battery has a long battery life, the brushed metal shell has first-class workmanship and feel, and the keyboard typing is smooth and comfortable. No matter how long it is on, it won't be hot, and the fan sound is so soft that it is almost inaudible. The screen is very beautiful and beautiful, the battery is very durable, can last for six hours, basically meet the needs of going out 
1	Recently, several friends asked me to buy this book. Everyone likes it! 
1	Although this book itself is positioned as a university entrance reading, after I have completed my Bachelor of Chinese Language and Literature, I still find it fresh. A lot of knowledge is understood for the first time, and some knowledge is not very clear. The reason for choosing this version of the book is that, on the one hand, there are a lot of pictures, and more importantly, it is for Mr. Wang Li. My ancient Chinese teacher admired the works of Mr. Wang Li very much, and I admired Mr. Wang very much, and appreciated the rigorous and meticulous academic attitude of the older generation. Well, a book that benefits people, especially for those who like ancient literature, is definitely a great reference book. 
1	"It is worth reading, the questions raised in the book are worth thinking about, and they are not unreasonable. Personal support for the ideas in this book. Because it is relatively radical, it makes many people uncomfortable, but this kind of ""radical"" is what the mainstream of society and elites lack, and the people are secretly surging. I personally think that senior leaders should seriously consider the views in the book. I think the direction is right, and the specific approach can be more tactful and meticulous to make it more operable. The big problem in this book is the specific writing, the logic between the sentences is slightly confused, and the argument support can be further strengthened. "
1	The same rooms are small and large, and the location is relatively remote. Breakfast is not in the form of a buffet, but in the form of a set meal. If you can’t choose it yourself, you have to buy it yourself. This is very inconvenient, I don't like it very much. Hotel feedback April 7, 2008: Thank you very much for visiting our hotel, and thank you for your attention to our hotel and asking some questions. The size of the same hotel room is the same. Regarding the same room, there are small and large problems. It is the situation that our hotel gives guests a free upgrade to stay in order to guarantee the reservation of the guest’s room when the original room type is insufficient or abnormal. The hotel’s breakfast is a set meal. There are 8 fixed Chinese refreshment packages for guests to choose In addition to the package, other snacks need to be added. Guests need to purchase their own. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you! Welcome to our hotel again! 
1	This time I went to Sanya and stayed in 3 hotels. The first one was ordinary in Sanya Bay. It felt fairly clean, but there was no hot water. I found a gecko when I entered the room. The next day I stayed at Titianyu. Although I felt that it was not as good as the Sheraton, it was indeed the best among the three places I stayed in this trip to Sanya, but the breakfast was too expensive and there was nothing to eat. The Pearl River is in the East China Sea, so the Russians There are so many, and there are many locals going to the beach, it feels too noisy. We later changed to a sea-view room. The sea view was not bad. The balcony was too small. It was pitiful. The room was okay. The food was expensive. For lunch, one vegetable, one dim sum, one vegetable pickled rice, the billing cost more than 100, and we fainted. . Another thing to remind is that if you go to Spring Garden to eat seafood, you need to be patient. The three of us ordered 4-5 dishes, but we waited for 2 hours before we finished all the dishes. (It was the boss’s wife who urged herself to eat, and the food was ready within 2 hours) 
1	The location of the hotel is acceptable, close to the train station and Wal-Mart supermarket (a taxi is required), and the lobby and parking lot in front are relatively spacious. The facilities in the room are also good. There are three shortcomings: 1. The network is unstable, and several rooms cannot be connected to the Internet. The network cable and socket are very worn and occasionally disconnected. 2. General Tie at the lobby shop closed the door. If you want to buy something, you need to go outside. 3. The name of the economic set meal provided by the restaurant is not true. The set meal of 25 yuan is about the same as the one sold outside for 5 yuan! Hotel feedback March 27, 2008: Dear customer: Hello! Thank you for your support to Jincheng Hotel. We have reported the three issues you have reported to relevant departments of the hotel. Thank you! 
0	It is the only hotel in Huayuan Industrial Park. Although it has 3 stars, the overall feeling is better than the express hotel. 
0	All the facilities in this hotel are too old. Breakfast is almost impossible to swallow. The bath water is too small to bathe. There is no writing desk in the room, so I have to sit on my suitcase and go online on the luggage rack. Originally, I wanted to stay for two days if I let it go. But when I was watching TV at night, there was a big mouse running in front of me, which scared me to death. There is no way to change hotels the next morning. 
0	The top ranking of this book is exaggerated, and it feels less than the full set of circles. 1) Many stories in the story are far-fetched and have poor logic. 2) If it is just the above reasons, it can be accepted casually. After all, some tricks and tricks are still useful in actual work. Seeing the tail of the story, I feel that the author is in a hurry and is extremely irresponsible. Wang Wei's inexplicable disappearance is really incomprehensible. Although you are mainly talking about the workplace, the integrity of the story should be considered and be worthy of readers. 3) Books with poor logic cannot give high marks! Not recommended to buy! 
0	Obviously, Ctrip's guests were not treated well. After 8 years of Ctrip, I wondered for the first time whether it is necessary to continue using Ctrip. I booked a double-bed deluxe room facing the pool 2 weeks ago, two large and one small, and I checked in at 3 pm and gave a single room with a 1.5-meter bed. When I returned to the hotel at 11 o’clock, it was found that there was no agreement. There are two single-bed high-profile guests in a remote area facing the residence, the reason is that there is no room for a meeting; at 11 o'clock in the evening, dragging a suitcase and a child with a broken foot and rushing to the hotel To go is absolutely infuriating. I called and asked the deputy manager of the lobby to come and explain that there was no following. The result of the complaint to Ctrip was that the hotel will not apologize, will not upgrade for free, will not reduce the room rate, but can send a fruit plate for free... When we are a beggar! This kind of service will never come again! Of course, the hotel may not care if your Ctrip customers come or not. 
0	"It's too naive. The whole book has nothing but the words ""David, you can't"". No help for children and parents at all. waste money. "
1	I personally like small animals very much. I saw this book on a book about pets, but I went to many shops and just missed it. My friend told me about Dangdang.com, which is full of books, so I searched for the book with the mentality of trying it, and it turned out that it really did. When I got this book, I read it carefully, and I was moved by the short stories one after another, and my heart was warm again and again. This is a book worth reading. Maybe because of this book, you will change your prejudice against dogs. Enjoy the baptism of the soul and read this book. 
0	Today is June 27th, more than 2 months before my stay at Hanting Express Hotel (Shanghai New Hongqiao) (I stayed on April 12th), I have no memory of other things, but the trouble caused by checkout after leaving the hotel I have troubled me so far. On that day, I booked two superior double rooms for RMB 246 through Ctrip. The total price was RMB 492. At that time, all the check-in procedures went smoothly. The waiter took out the Ctrip order and used the card in an orderly manner. I took the order and signed. Of course, I paid attention to the card to sign the order. The pre-authorization was 800 yuan. The waiter did not check every other receipt issued by the waiter. I left the store to check out the next day. Trouble came. When I swiped the card again to sign the bill, I found that I had swiped 568 yuan and I refused to sign the bill. It was different from my booking. At this time, the waiter took out my receipt from yesterday and said, I live in a superior double room with a price of 284 yuan. I feel dizzy. I was not careful yesterday. Yesterday I didn’t have any tips. I asked to pay the bill today. I talked to the waiter. Finally, the service supervisor agreed to settle the bill at 492 yuan. It was over, but it was not the case. The waiter swiped my card twice, one time was 492 yuan, I agreed to sign the bill to him, and the other was 568 yuan. I refused to sign and took back the bill. However, when I received the bank statement, I still found that the payment was deducted twice. I called the hotel and gave a reply after agreeing to the inquiry. I haven’t received any reply so far, and then I contacted the bank. The bank contacted the bank, and the bank finally returned 492 yuan on June 13 (it is estimated that the bank had N negotiations with the store). Around June 25, the bank called me to return 492 yuan. I checked the situation and reported it to the bank again. , It should be returned 568 yuan, once again I said that the bill that I did not sign is still deducted, I am waiting for the result of the bank negotiation. I don't know how long to wait this time-------------------- 
1	"Today I finally watched ""Win or Lose"" again. The first time I saw it, I found the plot to be very attractive. The others were nothing. But the second time I saw it, I felt different. What was particularly impressive was Zhou Rui’s attitude towards life. And his attitude towards people and things, indeed life is short, career is only part of life, the most important thing is how to make yourself happy. The other is that Fang Wei's focus on the process is still a result. "
0	I find that I don't like it very much and the content is very small. Although the decoration is very good, but I won't buy it next time, it is better to watch Doraemon! 
0	This is the first time I booked this hotel. The location of the hotel is okay, but it must have been in business for some years. The decoration is a bit old. I checked in and entered the room. I felt that the condition of the room was not good, so I decided to lose half a day’s rent. Find other hotels 
1	The performance is good, the screen is good, and it is lighter than the original company's Dell D610, so some people say that the SL400 is heavier, I don't think it is enough for office and ordinary entertainment. 
0	The first time I checked into this hotel apartment through Ctrip, the front desk service attitude of the hotel was extremely rude. I arrived at the hotel at about 9 o'clock on September 30. I was planning to put down my luggage and go to see F1. However, the receptionist said that if I entered the host before 10 am, I would also charge a half-day room charge, saying that this is a hotel policy. I asked him to find the manager. He said that it was useless to find anyone. The computer had already set up a fixed program. I asked him to tell me the complaint hotline for Shanghai Golden Week, but he said he didn't know. Finally, I called Ctrip, and Ctrip negotiated with the hotel for a while before checking in for me. This is simply an unreasonable rule. If a half-day room charge is charged for check-in before 10 am, can the hotel charge a day and a half for a day? Advise everyone who plans to stay at this hotel, be sure to confirm the check-in time at the time of booking without any room charge. 
0	The battery life is short. A 6-cell battery is fine. The heat dissipation is a little bit hot. It is a bit hot for 3-5 hours. The hard disk has only 1 C drive without partition. OFFCIE is a genuine one. 
1	The Chaoyang room is not too big, the south-facing room is bigger with a big sofa, but it's darker. The lobby is dark and not bright. The location is relatively central, that is, there is a single line at the door. 
1	Very cost-effective, the configuration is not bad enough for ordinary households without too high requirements, good for office use, good-looking, simple and generous 
1	It's a pity that the hardware facilities are not complete, and the noise from the roadside leaves a little regret for what should be a perfect hotel. I hope that Home Inns franchise stores will take a step forward. 
1	The hotel is a bit old, with average facilities and average breakfast. The location is near the railway station, but the surrounding environment is a bit messy. 
1	It should be the best hotel in Jinan, but the room is not big enough in terms of grade. It is a great pity that there is no own shopping mall! 
0	I really don't feel much about this book. What the author said is very abstract, I feel quite empty and meaningless. A little regret buying this book. 
1	The standard room environment is not very good, with low floors and mosquitoes. Business room is ok, big bed room 1 
0	The translation is not very good, a bit convoluted, and there are some points to learn from, but considering that the status of Korean women is different from that in China, the angle of this book is not suitable for me. 
1	It's definitely super three-star standard, it's located in a commercial area, it's very convenient for shopping, and there is a sheep grocery store right across the door, absolutely authentic. Except that the price is slightly more expensive, overall it is very satisfactory 
0	The book is very good, but it is too troublesome to do it. If you can do it, it should be used a lot. It is a good choice for health and pursuit of people. 
0	Due to the flight delay, I arrived at the hotel around 11:30 in the middle of the night. After registration, no one asked whether the hotel has a smoke-free floor. The hotel does not provide matches. I ran downstairs in the middle of the night to buy a lighter. There is no food in the room, no water, and the toilet is uncomfortable (the seat cushion is too small), the wind is strong in the middle of the night, and the wind blows loudly from the windows (Room 1115). 20 breakfasts, at own expense, a bowl of preserved egg and lean meat porridge, fried rice noodles, a glass of milk, and an egg. The place to eat is expensive, and overall there is no place to praise. I stayed for 2 and a half days, and in the last half of the day I went upstairs and I showed my room card. The clean and hygienic aunt said to ask downstairs, which lasted 3 or 4 minutes. 
1	A very recommended book. I bought it for my daughter at first. After seeing it, my colleagues thought it was good and asked me to buy them many times. 
0	I don't know why everyone pays so much attention to this book, and the evaluation is also quite high. At that time, I followed the trend to read this book. After I bought it, I really read it page by page in the car, but the more I saw it, the more I felt that the book was dross. The general content of the book is too idealistic, too coincidental, and the detailed description is not bad, but the interest is greater than the educational significance. At most, it can only be regarded as a book that has nothing to do with you. no way. 
1	The price/performance ratio is very high, 2999.00 yuan, which can be configured with a relatively high laptop. Very cost-effective. Basic configurations are available. 
1	The 15.4-inch screen at this price is more cost-effective. Delivery is also very fast. I am from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, and it will arrive within two days. 
0	My order was sent out on July 17th, but it is August 2nd, and I have not received the goods. How to post comments? There is a phone number on the order. Even if you can't find the address, please call and ask where it is. I hope your website will check it carefully to avoid such problems in the future. 
1	Graphics card and memory are good ~ good heat dissipation, not hot except for the tuyere, and the effect of playing games is good ~ Vista has many advantages that XP can't compare, there is no need to cling to XP~ The actual situation is that many people do not use Vista. I don't know how to set it up, so I don't think it's easy to use~ In addition, this notebook runs vista smoothly. It’s the first time I bought a laptop on JD. I was a little worried, but it seems that I was overworried. Perfect screen is a brand new machine 
1	Qinghai Hotel is not bad in Xining, the double bed room is very close to the door, sound insulation is not too good, the TV is small and old, but the hotel environment is okay, and the breakfast is good. 
0	To be honest, in fact, this kind of book can be written by anyone with a little experience, and there is no substantive content. I generally don't like to read this kind of life philosophy book. In fact, everyone has their own. A set of life philosophy, but some people love to take it out and say it, of course, these people are also convincing and unconvincing. The content of this book really makes me unable to compliment. I can't solve any problems, I just wrote some bullshit that everyone knows, and there is still a chief editor to recommend, which really disappoints me. Oh yes, it is said that I wrote a book that can change a woman's life afterwards. I hope everyone will be wary of this trap, but it is not very expensive, I believe some people like it. 
0	I stayed in the worst hotel in Jiangsu. When preparing to take a bath at night, a group of men opened the door directly with their room card, saying that the room belonged to him, and the luggage was still inside. I checked in this afternoon and there was nothing in the room. Called the waiter, it turned out that they threw their luggage out without checking out. Therefore, other people's keys can open my door. terror! Who dares to live up to this level of management? The bath water was not hot and I caught a cold the next day. Breakfast is not even mentioned, it is a mess, there are few dishes, all are cold. The waiter had a bad attitude and owed her all. This kind of hotel recommends that Ctrip be blacklisted so as not to harm others. 
1	I found that the ASUS wireless network card is really good, and it can receive the wireless routing signal from the 200m building. I have tried it, Lenovo, HP, and Dell, but they have no better signal. The heat dissipation of the notebook is very good, a hundred times stronger than my HP, and the performance is nothing. The accessories are very rich, there are screen cleaning cloths, cable ties, more careful than other brands 
1	Location and traffic are good. The room is ok, come again next time 
0	The heat is average, the left-hand tray heats up faster. The screen is average, the viewing angle is a bit worse, not too bright. The built-in software is not enough. The machine is relatively heavy and not suitable for girls. 
0	It is a flashy work of the time, with a strong commercial atmosphere and limited medical standards. Just flip over, don't take it too seriously. It is better to have no books than nothing. 
0	Vista is indeed very...still in the running-in period, it takes a lot of memory, and the temperature of the right palm rest is relatively high. The heat dissipation needs to be improved, and the sound is slightly louder. The widescreen looks a bit too wide. The distance between the USB sockets is too close to use them all. 
0	The service is not so good, too old, the revolving restaurant does not work, the breakfast waiter seems to owe them money, very poor 
0	The hotel facilities are good. But the location is too far. It is very inconvenient to wait for a taxi to arrive, so I asked the door boy Bang to call a taxi the next morning to bid for my ten yuan handling fee. The western restaurant is really bad. The western food ordered I can’t even eat it and I asked the chef to say that it’s not authentic Western food. It’s unacceptable, and the price is as high as other hotels. Never choose this hotel next time 
1	The most attractive part of Marco in Hong Kong is of course her convenient conditions; the morning tea in the nearby Maxim’s Restaurant is very good (in the cultural center) and very distinctive; one of Marco’s services is that it is attentive and considerate. After checking out, we will continue to go shopping. When we return to the hotel to pick up our luggage with large and small bags, the waiter kindly invited us to the deepest corner of the luggage room, where there are large tables and chairs, so you can avoid The embarrassing act of unpacking, merging, and bagging in the hotel lobby, calmly organizing the luggage and then going out neatly, is really a considerate move. 
1	This is the first time I have stayed at this hotel and I feel pretty good overall. The staff here are very welcoming and the rooms are newly renovated, very quiet and comfortable. The traffic here is very convenient, extending in all directions. The LCD TV, Kohler bathroom, pure wool carpet, IKEA furniture in the room. . . . . . It feels very high-grade and tasteful! Moreover, the Internet is still exclusive to 2M, no money, great value! ! ! Strongly recommend friends to stay in this hotel! 
0	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I mean management. 1 The front desk was not familiar with the location of the hotel. A taxi from Ningbo asked him if he was in Xinqi District. He heard the sound of turning over the paper while listening to the phone. It was probably a map, sweat. . . 2 Ask if there is a non-smoking room, answer, there are ashtrays in the room, generally do not smoke, but the guests can not control it. gosh! Need training on the concept of non-smoking rooms? 3 There is phone consumption during the hotel checkout, I said it is impossible, I always use mobile phones. The front desk repeatedly said it would certainly not be mistaken. I checked the time, and it suddenly occurred to me that during that time, when I entered the room, I saw an electrician repairing the room's lights (I didn't apply for repairs). I asked them to check the records, and finally found out that it was the mobile phone of the front office manager, and the hotel itself used the guest's room phone to call the mobile phone, and it was really unheard of to blame the guest. 4 Let the hotel specialize in separate washing and dry cleaning during laundry, fools all know that dry cleaning must be dirty. It turned out to be unwashed when delivered. After questioning, I said re-washing, which delayed my wearing. Don't say anything. I will check out the next day and let the hotel where I will be staying to see me off. But no one knew about it when checking out. If I hadn't asked a lot of thoughts, I'm afraid my clothes would fall into the sea. It was agreed that it was delivered, but it was not delivered after the time passed. Later, I called to urge it and finally delivered it, but I was even more disappointed that it was still not cleaned, and it was strange that there were spots of oil stains in the originally clean place. , I really don’t know if I am doing laundry or wearing clothes. Seriously doubt the origin of the outsourcing laundry of the hotel. 5 Electricians did not greet the guests when repairing the lights, and there was no second person present in the guest room. After the repair, the wall dust was all on the quilt and no one cleaned it. 6 Ctrip took the room close to the nearby nightclub, and did not rest until twelve o'clock in the evening. After the complaint, he did not say that he could change rooms. All in all, the impression of this hotel is very bad. Hotel Feedback November 9, 2007: First of all, the hotel expresses its deep apologies to the guests, and thank you for your comments. The hotel has strengthened its staff training so that each employee has a stronger sense of service. We will carefully absorb the opinions and criticisms of our guests, and we will change them if we don't, and we will be crowned if we don't. I hope that all guests are the supervisors of our hotel, and let us do better under your supervision. Thank you! 
0	The built-in VISTA system is slower. And it is divided into a district. A C drive 250G. Reset to factory settings. Adjust the C drive to 40G. The remaining 210G can't be found. This system is not used to it yet. It is recommended that the manufacturer directly divide the user zone. 
0	Ordinary books, I don’t understand. I can’t find acupuncture points. If I’m too professional, I’m still being fooled by the business. 
0	I booked a night for a guest from abroad. When I left the restaurant the next day, the guest said that the dinner was eaten in the hotel restaurant and the stomach was upset. But I had to catch a plane and sent it to the airport lounge and vomited and diarrhea. When I arrived in Bangkok, I was admitted to the hospital. I stayed for two days, unaccompanied in Thailand. The next business trip was cancelled and I went back to the United States from Bangkok. It made me feel guilty and worried. You are also considered Shanghai 4 stars. Level? Note: They have entered the country for 3 weeks. This is the last day. It will not be unacceptable! The hotel feedback August 13, 2008: We attach great importance to the situation you reported. Our hotel is a foreign-related four-star hotel. The operating regulations for guest rooms and catering are quite strict. The preservation of food raw materials and food processing in the hotel's Chinese and Western restaurants are very professional. Since the hotel opened, there has never been a complaint of discomfort caused by food. But we still apologize for what happened to our guests! Hope he can recover soon! 
1	The battery has been used for a long time. Last time I took it on the train and watched a movie for more than 7 hours. In the end, people really couldn't stand it anymore. The battery still had electricity. The keyboard is also very comfortable. 
1	Excellent workmanship, high cost performance, practical configuration, keyboard design, screen color, and appearance molds are very worthy of the price 
1	I got the thing in the morning. It looks the same as the other sl400 I bought before, but it is a bit slower than it. I don't know if the quality is good or not. Now I haven't found the problem. It's okay. Now I have used it for a long time and I haven't found the problem, just slower 
1	"The content of the book is not much, and many of the stills can be turned over in two or more clicks. The interviews in the middle part are more professional and lengthy. From the book, I can feel the difficulty of growing up in that era, especially when I wrote that he became a celebrity after the performance of ""Heroes Without Regrets"", but he still lived in the dormitory in the old alley, showering with the men, squatting in the latrine, and feeling The eyes and pointers of others are quite emotional...Through this book, you can see a public figure on the other side of normal life, and you can buy and flip through it. "
0	Is it because the book is sold on Dangdang.com and the price is increased? Wasn't it 16 yuan? Why did the price of wine suddenly rise? Don't buy it anymore, wait until the price is adjusted! I have already bought this book, the content is very general, 23.8 yuan, not worth it! 
0	For the third year of living alone, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment, right? This book feels incomprehensible or useless. Feeling a waste of money is suitable for giving away. 
0	Bored, moaning without illness, according to her, a woman had better find a rich man to marry as soon as possible, and she had to faint when she was in her twenties and think that she was a noble, and others would treat you as a noble. , The stick is obscene! 
1	High performance-price ratio, comfortable appearance, good heat dissipation. High cpu. In fact, I bought it at 8600, and 256 alone is enough. 
0	This book shouldn’t be called by this name. It doesn’t always agree with the content of the book. It will make a lot of people pay for it and tarnish the author’s reputation. 
0	I know that this set of discs sells well in Dangdang, but I still want to say that not only is the order of a good work bad, but the bad video quality is terrible. . . A lot of content is missing, oh,,,,, speechless,,,,, when will you be more dedicated to the original manufacturers in the six districts,,, 
0	Half of the rooms in the hotel have no sunlight or ventilation. The waiter has a bad attitude. It takes half an hour even if no one pays. The toilet in the bathroom is broken~~ The toilet can be broken accidentally. Be careful to use it. The sheets were not clean and there were pubic hair. The room smelled of toilet, disgusting. Compared with Home Inns in other provinces and cities, it is too far behind, and I am disappointed. The hotels around the Forbidden City are cheaper than this one. I think the price/performance ratio of this house is too inappropriate. 
0	The heat dissipation is not as good as expected, it is very hot. The Linux system does not have a graphical interface installed, only characters, and most people can only change the system, and it is very inconvenient to change the system. It is necessary to modify the BIOS and change to IDE mode, and after installing VISTA No way to activate, very troublesome, looking for a solution 
0	I bought this book according to the ranking list, and wanted to collect it and tell it to her when my daughter grows up. After I bought it, I found that the printing quality of the book was very poor, especially the smell of lead. I briefly flipped through the storyline, lest it be too general. Why is it so popular? Is the perspective of an adult different from that of a child? I decided to return it! 
0	Personally, I think this book is very general, not as good or as magical as others have said. Many things have been read on the Internet, but she just made a summary. . 
1	The hardware is relatively new, such as LED LCD screen, 11n wireless network card, 4570 graphics card (although relatively low-end, but the performance is close to the previous generation of high-end cards). Fever is better than expected. 
1	The location is a little bit, with some ethnic customs! If you have a chance, you can try it 
1	Worthy of this price, even if compared with Shenzhou. I spent 169 to upgrade to 3G memory, plus T4200, plus VISTA, now it's perfect. 
0	The AHCI driver of the AMD chipset is difficult to install! Ask Hong? Customer service, actually told me not to pretend, rubbish! No way to change VISTA 
1	The machine is a good machine, and it is Lenovo's notebook, with good sound effects. I bought it at the special price, suddenly the price dropped to 5499, and decided to sell. Look now, I really shouldn't be so impulsive. 
1	Overall it's not bad, the transportation service is okay, the hotel is a bit old, it doesn't look like a four-star grade, the lobby is very old, hehe, the price is reasonable. 
0	Why are the prices of Dangdang items reduced after I bought them? I just bought the USB flash drive and I want to go up and write a review, and I saw the price reduction. Now I see the price of the purchased items are falling again. Fainted! Dangdang, the price is also It's too unstable! 
1	Facing the Yalu River Bridge, with binoculars and darts, the facilities are nothing to say! Downstairs is the scenic spot! 
1	Recommended! I hope everyone can read it very usefully. 
0	Pros: Close to the commercial center, not far from the train station, the price is fair. Disadvantages: the room equipment is poor, almost the standard of a guest house, the surrounding environment is dirty and poor, and the noise is loud. The smell of barbecue is pungent.

1	The heat dissipation is very good. I can’t feel any heat after turning it on for a day. My colleague’s HP is already hot. The screen has a small light on the Internet. When I turn off the light at night and use the computer, I feel very good. Xiaohei runs very stable. I bought it without any problems. It’s been a month, and there have been no problems, and I’m still quite satisfied with JD’s delivery speed much faster than before. Orders are placed on Monday and arrives on Wednesday. It seems like JD’s own delivery staff is good 
0	This hotel is terrible. There are 3 large entertainment venues on the left, right and back. The noise is noisy until 3 o'clock in the morning. The sound insulation of the hotel is very poor. The decoration of the room is very vulgar, and the central air-conditioning sound is very loud. Hotel Feedback July 15, 2008: Dear guests, thank you for your valuable comments on this hotel. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to you during your stay in this hotel. As for your air conditioning problem, our hotel management attaches great importance to it. We will immediately find professionals to improve the air conditioning problem. We will continue to improve our shortcomings in the future. To provide you and all guests with better service, thank you again, and look forward to your next visit, thank you! 
0	The heat dissipation seems average. I am optimistic about the coupons used by many members. It would be better if I had a coupon, which is not a good deal. 
0	The content is just general, and I always feel that the translation is not good enough! The language is incoherent and there is no focus. It is just a simple translation of Korean into vernacular, without special features! 
0	Halfway through, some pages were blank, and a good book was cut off in the middle like this. I want to return the item, but I have already made notes on the book. 
1	This is a very beautiful set of books. It was fun to watch when my daughter was two and a half years old. Also learn some of these things to do. For example, wash your hands by yourself, sleep alone, wear clothes and socks by yourself... The whole set of books is very warm and warm, very suitable for parent-child reading, can enhance the communication between children and parents, and make children and parents more trust and understanding. However, if your child is over three years old and has an early wisdom, it is recommended not to buy. Because my daughter is now two years old and nine months old, and it’s a bit naive to see the baby after three months. 
0	Vista is not a family premium version, but there is also an xp family version, the Jingdong standard is wrong! The location of the usb interface is really unscientific, and the price cannot be too high. 
1	I always thought that the world’s richest man was Bill &#183; Gates or Warren&#183; Buffett, and now I know that there is such an invisible real world’s richest man in the world, and they also fight many wars and wars in the history of the world. The financial crisis is related. It turns out that there is such a side in world history, which is really eye-opening. 
0	I don’t know why the sound of the CD-ROM drive is so loud when it is turned on, and the vista is installed, it is very slow, very uncomfortable, and there is only one zone, it took a night to switch to XP, and the speed is reasonable. 
1	The appearance is good, the actual delivery is a 320G hard disk, with VISTA BASIC operating system, the quality of the package is also good 
0	The room is small and does not match the name of the executive room. In addition, the massage in this hotel must not be called, it is super dark! There will be thugs at checkout, please pay attention! Will never stay at this hotel again. 
0	In order to protect the environment, I did not request to change the sheets the next day, but the bed had to be made up. They just messed up, crumpled, and really can't reach four stars. Two stars still barely. The price system is far from international practice. It left me the impression that this is a black shop. I hope that other guests who want to stay in this hotel must carefully check their prices through various channels and time periods before placing an order. If necessary, the order can be withdrawn at any time to avoid being cut. 
0	The printing quality of the book is very poor, it feels like a pirated book, and many pages are blurred and look very troublesome. When the book arrived, I felt disappointed and couldn't find the feeling of reading. 
1	"Seeing Teacher Yin's post from Tianya, I immediately purchased 5 copies. In addition to reading by myself, I also strongly recommend and give it to friends. As soon as I get ""A Good Mother Is Better than a Good Teacher"", I can't stop it, a good book! See you late! It awakens the deep memory of my heart and makes me experience the joy of learning and growing again. After reading ""A Good Mother Is Better than a Good Teacher"", my biggest feeling is that I know I am wrong. As a parent, it’s fine if you don’t know your mistakes. The key is that you are always self-righteous and stubbornly implement your wrong ideas. Correct the mistakes and start now. "
1	excellent service! The staff is very polite! The room is very clean but small! The room can't talk directly, it needs the switchboard, which is inconvenient! In my opinion: it can only be a four-star hotel, and it can only be a three-star hotel in Huangshan! 
0	The transportation is still relatively convenient and the price is relatively cheap, but the facilities are a bit old, there is no Internet to access the Internet, and the quality of the waiters is relatively low. 
1	1. The workmanship is really good, small and suitable for business trips. 2. The color is still black, at least it will not feel unstable for business use. 3. The size of the keyboard is reasonable, and you won't press the wrong key when typing. 4. The speed of TD is a bit worse than that of WCDMA, but mobile services are at least better than China Unicom and China Telecom. The speed does not matter. The key is service. 
1	Beautiful appearance, matte keyboard feels comfortable, configuration is not bad, beautiful appearance, matte keyboard feels comfortable, configuration is not bad 
0	The attitude is super bad. I booked a normal standard room, but I said that I didn’t have it. I said that I had a free upgrade to the deluxe double standard. I must have a network cable. The next day I told me that I can’t use the Internet, and the room is in the annex. Far away, my things are so heavy that no one cares about a girl who resists like this. The next day I said that I would change rooms, but the cleaning staff was stunned that they could not understand the Mandarin spoken at the front desk, and asked me to walk back and forth with my luggage, not knowing what I was doing! ! ! ! As a result, I changed it twice and changed to a standard room. I was afraid that the standard was not as luxurious as it was. As a result, I found that it was not only in the main building, but also much better than the previous day's luxurious! ! ! ! ! ! At least the windows are big and the network cable works! I was very dissatisfied with the first day of check-in and felt cheated! ! ! 
1	Generally speaking, it is okay. Several shortcomings: 1) The bathroom smells bad; 2) It is inconvenient to use, and you have to walk across the bridge to greet on the street. 3) Chinese restaurants are expensive 
0	It is not difficult to install the XP system with a little preparation, but the AHCI driver of the hard disk, I have been thinking about installing it for most of a day. There is also a shortcoming that is not a shortcoming. The machine style is relatively new, and the corresponding screen protector and keyboard protector are more difficult to find. The 16;9 screen and the chocolate keyboard are trendy. 
0	Vista is very entangled.. my wife likes the interface.. I wanted to change it, but today I failed to install xp, but fortunately, the partition is good, it basically does not affect 
0	The content of this book is really not humorous. It is daydreaming if you want to read the book and try to remember English words. 
0	Originally, psychology is a category that I am very interested in. At first reading Bi Shumin's several books were not bad, I bought two books. I finally finished reading it, and I found it particularly boring. It was unsuccessful to think about suspense, to literacy was unsuccessful, and to tell a story was uninteresting. No gain, so disappointed! ! ! 
0	After I got this book, I was very angry because the spine of the book was completely broken, o(︶︿︶)o greatly affected the mood of reading. I don’t know how a book damaged to this degree can be shipped to customers! ! ! ! ! 
1	"The long ink stains are all poured in this book. Zeng Zimo, a ""livestock"", traveled across the oceans and came to the strange Dartmouth College. In the United States, she seemed so conservative and a little out of place, but she succeeded. She changed her attitude towards the Chinese at the top of Morgan Stanley. the opinion of. We can't help but admit that the god of fate cares for him and likes him. But she herself has made little-known efforts. In this book, Zeng Zimo confides to you: American life, intense interviews, day and night work, returning to Phoenix, and her fashion statement... "
0	Outdated rooms, poor service and outdated equipment. Rubbish hotel! 
1	The configuration is reasonable, the functions are complete, the wine red is beautiful, the keyboard is very flexible, and the hand feels good. The current price is also good, no bright spots and dark spots were found. Jingdong delivery is fast enough. 
1	The room is not big and the decor is fine. The railway station is closer. (For 9 yuan) 
0	I arrived at about 6 o'clock in the morning, and said that it was necessary to calculate the room rate for the day. I said no problem, most hotels are like this. On the third day, the train did not leave until 9 o’clock in the evening, so I postponed it for a long time to check out at 6 o’clock, but at 5:40 I called to urge me to come to the ward round, and I said what did you urge before 6 o’clock. Ah, and I arrived at 6 o’clock that morning. It’s just a matter of delaying me for another half an hour or an hour. It’s the same as catching guests. Not going anymore. 
1	The service is very warm and the transportation is very convenient. I will choose this hotel next time if I go to Beijing! 
1	The most cost-effective hotels in Hong Kong-Kowloon area with 3 stars or more! Inconvenient transportation but you can take the hotel's free shuttle bus to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui (20 minutes). I have stayed at this hotel 6 times in 15 years. I booked through Ctrip on May 3-6, which is better than Hong Kong Friends booking is even cheaper! And stay in the upgraded 28th floor executive standard room, fitness room and swimming free. Shopping (popular things) is convenient, the shopping center is 4 floors below, the shopping center opposite the hotel-PARKnSHOP and XX Seafood Restaurant 59HKD/person buffet Hot pot is better. It takes 5-7 minutes to walk to Tsuen Wan City Mall Plaza. (Strange? Why do netizens report that shopping is inconvenient-it is not convenient to shop around the world after 10pm!) There is a convenience store on the first floor of the hotel. In addition, this room is 18 Below the floor seems to be a standard room for a mainland tour group, and a deluxe room is reserved by Ctrip on the 18th floor. It is not convenient to buy a world-famous hotel in Hong Kong! Supplementary review July 29, 2008: My wife and I traveled to Hong Kong when we were married in 1994. Book a standard room on the 15th floor (300HKD) through a friend. In 2007, I took my child to book a room on the 22nd floor (580HKD) through Ctrip in a deluxe room on the 22nd floor (580HKD). 
0	The main reason for buying it is firstly because of the popularity of this book, which makes people a little curious; secondly, because the acupoint map is attached, the wife wants it. There is not much hope of being honest about the content of the book. When I bought it, there was a Bodhisattva printed in the center of the cover. The content was the same as expected, and the text was mysterious. It felt like reading the martial arts secrets. If Chinese medicine continues to do this, it really kills itself. 
0	I have already bought a lot of books for people. The last 4 books ordered are missing the big picture, catalogue, 1-5 pages, please check carefully when you receive the goods! 
1	The courtyard environment is very good, the rooms are okay, some of the facilities are outdated, the service of a lady at the reception desk is a bit poor, but overall it is ok. 
0	The price is a lot cheaper than the market price, but it seems to be more expensive than when I bought the first one~ If it is cheaper, it will definitely be Jingdong~~~ 
0	What is the world's largest Chinese online store, my! Don't talk about random delivery, customer service attitude is poor, processing speed is slow, and not proactive. Want to worry about consumers? 
1	The cost performance is very high, all configurations are relatively uniform, and daily office and household needs can basically be met 
1	The computer is bought for others. But Lenovo's things should be fine. I have one at home, which is very good. 
0	Let me say the good thing first: the location is in the center of the downtown area, the room is OK, the price is relatively cheap, and the breakfast included in the 188 room is also OK. Bad: the door is a one-way street, I don't know how to drive in, and finally drive in the opposite direction , There was a policeman holding a camera to shoot, I don’t know if there is any winning. There are few parking places, the attitude towards the guest desk and the security of parking is very bad, the room facing the street is very noisy, the big speaker in the opposite shopping mall It's too harsh, the bathroom bath water is difficult to adjust, the shower curtain is pulled half-and-half around the shower, and the bathroom is full of water. 
1	I read the open part online before buying a book. I never forget it. Every time I see the title of the book, I can’t put it down. I rarely buy a general online novel. I just read it casually. This is an exception. I bought it. After reading it in one go, I was a little disappointed. The first half of the book is very detailed, Xiao Qiu's persistence, Li Chuan's is unique, their touching love, the second half feels like a hasty ending, and it is no longer delicate. It is the first half that touches me, but it is still called It is a good book. The book is still interesting in my hand. 
0	1. There are too few USB ports and they are all on the left 2. There is no mouse in the package, which is a personal dissatisfaction. 
0	I don't understand why the huge Dangdang website sells pirated books. I have compared the original copy of the Book Building. The Dulala 1 I got is rough, and the handwriting is obviously lighter than the original. The pirated books that can be purchased for 8 yuan at the roadside book stalls were bought on Dangdang.com for twice the price. They were secretly delighted and recognized the quality and convenience of online book purchases. What a disappointment. 
1	The location of the hotel is very suitable for summer vacations, the hardware facilities are less than 5 stars, the service is up to standard, the breakfast buffet is relatively simple, and it is more difficult to hit. 
1	Still very good, nothing wrong. It's also good to use. The appearance and pictures are basically the same. 
0	"I don't know if I am precocious or something. I think the content is very general and some of the writing is too realistic. After all, everyone's values and outlook on life are different, so not all views agree. Reading a book still requires a wider field of vision. To be honest, after reading this book, I am not too fond of buying Korean, Japanese and other authors’ books. They are very narrow. I recommend you to read Yu Sai’s ""Chinese Lady"" and ""Chinese Gentleman"". This is the content that makes people truly cherished. "
0	Very broken hotel, known as 4 stars, but the actual situation is worse than the better 2 stars, breakfast is also terrible. 
0	"The 31st waiter deliberately cheated! ! We went back to the hotel at 12 o'clock to prepare for dinner and cleaned up and settled the bill. The waiter on the 31st asked us when to leave, and we said immediately. As usual, the waiter did not remind us to charge overtime, so we thought that there was no charge. So we didn't rush to eat and clean up... When we checked out at two o'clock, we actually charged for a long time! ! No notification, no reminder, no words about the charge, and the deposit will be deducted from the deposit directly after the invoice is issued. What is this not deliberately cheating? ? ? What's more ridiculous is that the 501 we lived in was a suite. When we first went in, we didn't find the remote control of the TV, so we called the front desk and sent an aunt to see it. The aunt walked in the door and said: ""It seems that 501 has no remote control."" After that, we found the remote control on the TV. Such a waiter and such a service really make Dunhuang dark! ! The breakfast is also ridiculous, at 8 o'clock, the porridge is cold... Alas, this hotel, I can’t go! ! "
1	The white piano paint is very beautiful and the sound effect is great. For surfing the Internet, doing some text office, watching movies, as long as it is not a super blockbuster, the key is the convenience. The battery used 5 and a half hours in continuous office 
0	The book is too small for children to read. Some pages have too many words and very small fonts. It may be suitable for elementary school students! I don't like it very much. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the configuration is good, and the price is high. Jingdong also guarantees that there is no unpacking. Check that it is a brand new machine 
0	"The first time I went to Henan Province and Zhengzhou, the impression was mediocre. It is understood that the Dahe Jinjiang Hotel has broken away from the cooperative relationship with Shanghai Jinjiang Group. The hotel room is very large, but the facilities are relatively outdated. It is also a ""deluxe double room"". Some rooms have a ""sofa"", and some rooms have no sofa and only two chairs. "
1	As a psychology book created by Westerners, it is explained from the perspective of Westerners. It has just begun to read, but I feel that the author's description of things is still westernized. Westerners like to focus on the key points while observing things, while Eastern people’s habits are more focused on the whole. This is the feeling of starting to read this book. However, the Western open education model adds unparalleled interest to this key textbook, which is obviously different from our country's textbook system. Personally think it is a good book worth reading. 
1	I bought 2 units within a month, and overall it is not bad. I installed xp immediately after I bought it. Vista is really difficult... 
0	"I originally ordered a standard room of 220 yuan, but later told me that there was only a standard room of 258 yuan. I had no choice but to agree. I thought that in this class of city, a room with an external standard of more than 300 yuan would be good. After the actual check-in, I felt that the price-performance ratio was poor and the facilities were rudimentary, unlike a window that could represent the image of the city. The air conditioner is centrally controlled and cannot be adjusted in the room. There is a peculiar smell just after entering the room. This is the only one I have encountered in the past two years who stayed in a hotel and had to pay another 10 yuan for parking! It may be that we are rare and weird. Advantages: Breakfast is good, meeting the standard of 20 yuan. Additional comments June 8, 2008: It is recommended to change the address to ""Liufeng Road"" so that it is easy to find by car! "
0	Disappointing hotel. 1. Entering the lobby, there is a smell of wine, and the separation between the restaurant and the lobby is not well done. 2. The elevator speed is very slow and small. However, the configuration of four elevators shortens the waiting time. 3. The room facilities are simple and the carpet and bathroom are very dirty, which makes people doubt the sanitation of the whole room. And in the room I stayed in, there were still a few moths flying non-stop, and it took a lot of trouble to culminate before falling asleep. If the bed comfort is a budget hotel, it is beyond reproach, but as a four-star hotel, it is unqualified. 4. The Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce on the second day of the stay, I don't know what those Taiwanese businessmen feel after their stay. And I was told that the price will rise to 550 if I continue to live. 5. The only thing worthy of recognition is the good location, diagonally opposite the Kite Plaza. I recommend a kite shop. Go out of the hotel and walk right along Shengli East Street until you reach the bridge. There is a kite shop in Yangjiabu. It is half cheaper than the one diagonally opposite Yuanfei. 
0	Jingdong’s service is really stinking. If it’s like Lao Liu, I’ll hire more customer service staff, and the phone calls have never been answered. And the logistics, it's dead. 
1	Very good hotel, four-star standard completely value-for-money enjoyment, service is very good 
1	The sound is very small during operation, and the heat dissipation is also good. The LED display screen is 16 to 9 and looks very wide. Strong performance and beautiful. 
1	The book is more expensive, but the historical materials are informative, enough to show that the author has spent time on the research of historical materials. The Kuomintang’s coalition and anti-communism actually represent the two ruling classes dealing with the relationship between non-main parties at the same time. Of course, as the external environment changes, as the party leader changes, this relationship will continue to be adjusted. Contradiction and struggle, opposition and unity. I think that opening this heavy book, learning from the book some historical materials that I don’t know or don’t understand, and looking at the people’s problem-solving skills in those days and learning from it, is the reason I bought this book, although The book has not been read yet, but I am looking forward to it. 
1	Room facilities are good, service is ok, breakfast is good, stay straight, Jinhua has no good choice 
0	Five-star hotel, three-star room, two-star service, zero-star environment. Will never come to this hotel again. 
0	It is a bit tricky to get the system for the first time. I want to install it again after the meeting, but unfortunately I don't have this chance. . . . 
1	The environment is first-rate, with deep courtyards, small bridges and running water, withered vines and old trees. Stayed multiple times. It's just that the breakfast is extremely bleak, regardless of Chinese and Western, hope to improve. 
0	I was a new user who was fooled. It was the first time I bought a book in Dangdang, but it has been shipped on the 14th and has not received it until now. I am really disappointed. I don't know where to ask for the book! ! ! 
1	I stayed at the COSCO Hotel on February 18th. I think the price of 400 is very cost-effective. The hotel may have just been renovated. The lobby is small, but very clean and tasteful. Since the Spring Festival has just passed, the red lanterns and the colored bars on the stairs are still there, which is very festive. The room is not big, but it should not be too small in Hong Kong. It’s very clean. I’m most satisfied with it. Every day I change the water and new slippers. The front desk clerk enthusiastically introduced us to the bus routes. The bus is very convenient. No. 18, 18P, 104, 113, and 5 will stop in front of the hotel. There is also a tram stop in front of the door, to Central and other bustling areas. The only unsatisfactory thing is that the bed is too short. My husband is 1.75 tall and he reached the edge of the bed as soon as he stretched his legs. The tall people are a bit aggrieved. Overall satisfactory 
0	The content is simple and the author is always eloquently defending himself. It is purely a book of hype and packaging. It talks about the experiences of Sun Yingui and his brothers and defends himself. 
0	JD’s delivery to the selected express company was too slow, and there were deep bumps on the outer packaging. Fortunately, the inner packaging was intact. 
1	"At the end of March, with the continuous rain, the first volume was slowly finished. The most impressive thing in the first volume is ""Introduce the old and bring forth the new."" Building a new civilization on the ruins of the old seems to have more vitality and creativity than following the old one. So, what enlightenment does this have for our changing era, this special 2009? The second volume, introducing modern history, will introduce more modern civilizations and changes. Reading history knows the replacement, learn from history! "
0	The environment is not bad. It may be that the local food culture is different from that of Dongguan. Chinese food is divided into two floors, one for drinking tea and one for eating. I want to eat, but I went to the wrong tea floor and opened Tea place, (each kind of tea costs 10 yuan) Later, when I transfer to the dining floor, I will also settle the tea place fee on that tea drinking floor, but I also open a tea place when I eat? They said it was calculated separately, which is equivalent to paying the tea fee repeatedly, which is really annoying! 
0	I thought there were dazzling lights. I don’t know if there are any. If you have any questions, please direct customer service. Kfmm is still very polite 
0	Can't get away from the old problems, the heat is large, the heat dissipation is not very good, it is still not as good as IBM, it needs to be improved; and the independent graphics card is almost... 
1	This is a targeted science book written to get rid of Westerners' superstition on statistics. Westerners advocate using facts and data to speak, and any point of view, as long as the corresponding statistics are presented, seems to have a valid reason. In fact, the fact may be far from what the statistics show. Now the Chinese media’s investigation of the real estate market has also reported using tricks debunked in many books. Taking a look at it will help keep a clear head in the complicated information society. It is not so easy to be fooled by certain people with ulterior motives. It is worthwhile First reading. 
0	Why do we not deliver fruit and coffee when we book a room every day! There is a fruit plate on the coroutine website! Simply unreasonable! 
0	There is no instruction, and the electronic manual in the CD is not much content. In addition, the price is reduced. Although it is only 11 yuan. I think I may be hit in a few days. I accept it. 
1	3999 from the mention, super cost-effective, very good to use. There is a feeling of IBM back then. Stable operation, quality guaranteed, and good heat dissipation 
1	"A few years ago, I happened to read Luo Tsai’s ""I Just Want to Be Your Millionaire"". At that time, I was so moved that my tears flowed. I admired this girl very much. She could write such feelings so delicately and warmly. , Fell in love with Luo Tsai's words fiercely. Seeing that there are articles in Immortal that have touched me, I bought it without hesitation. Not disappointed, still very warm. I am 6 years younger than Luo Tsai. I am also a girl born in the 1980s, and I am very familiar with the emotions and stories described in her article, and I am very heart-warming. Like Luozai, like that kind of warmth. "
0	However, there are still some disadvantages from the machine itself. The temperature at the left-hand outlet is relatively high; there is no Bluetooth on and off indicator on the surface of the machine; there is no lock on the LCD screen, but overall it is still very cost-effective , So very satisfied! 
1	1 The LED screen is very beautiful, and it is the perfect screen. 2 The appearance is also good. 3 The interface is rich. 4 The effect of Altlanstar is good. 
1	Very good! I booked a standard room and upgraded to a luxury standard on the day of check-in. The room is clean and the service is enthusiastic. If the windows of the room can be opened (permeable), it will be better! 
0	One of the worst I have ever stayed. The room is extremely stuffy, and there is a lack of oxygen at the plateau, and being stuffy in the room can easily aggravate altitude sickness; 2. Crude. The mattress on the window is crooked, exposing the wooden bed frame; 3. The toilet is more dirty than a guest house with dozens of yuan. The toilet lid is connected with iron wire. The flushing device needs to be lifted before it can be used; 4. Some waiters have a bad attitude. When I checked out, I carried a huge bag and asked the waiter if I could hurry up a little bit. I was stunned. In short, if you are not afraid of death, you can come and live. 
1	The workmanship is fine, and when you go out to paste the film, even the people who sell the computer say that the workmanship is very good! The mouse is very easy to use and does not require a mouse pad. The mouse that was bought by Lenovo before, and how to give it away is not as good as it is without a mouse. The pad will not be used. 
0	……When the fan is not running anything, the noise is relatively loud. The heat dissipation is not good. The light leakage on both sides of the screen is serious. The chicken rib VISTA is sent. It is not convenient to reinstall XP. The mirror is a fingerprint collector. A dedicated driver Difficult to find...no more than three highlights, no package (the merchants don’t care)... 
1	After I got it, I started to use 1G of memory to run slightly slower, very quiet, like a shutdown, the keyboard feels super good. 
1	This is a very touching book! And the age of the characters in the book is also doomed to their destiny! What is love? Can love be complete in the face of responsibility, suffering, and death? What is sorrow? Is the sincere but ignorant person sad? Is the person who has love in his heart sad but has left the hate? Is the person who sticks to the faith but hurts the relative sad? The line between right and wrong is blurred in all characters! Because In such an era, because living in such an era, there are many choices no choice! Many regrets have to be regretted! In addition to sadness and hatred, there is still that deep but helpless love! 
1	Beautiful, cost-effective, worth buying, hahahahahaha. It will also automatically change the desktop, one every day and one night, which makes me happy, so-called Lenovo feature, quack quack 
1	"The delivery speed of Dangdang.com can be said to be super fast. The order placed last night was received the next morning! Like it first! The baby bear picture book is determined by me after reading a lot of picture books. It is really good and easy to understand. It is especially suitable for young babies to start early parent-child reading. Every small animal in it is so cute, rich in expression, and particularly vivid. Image~~~Most of the content is repetitive, so that the baby can deepen the memory, it is recommended~~The only drawback is that many of the pictures in the fourth book ""Sleep"" have double images. I don't know why, which makes me feel a little inadequate! "
0	"The service support for the user's installation of the system and the driver is not good. The random information and the official website do not have any related installation instructions. Users must explore, find and download by themselves. There are ""secret doors"" during the installation process, such as BIOS settings, HDMI installation, etc. Easy As a result, people who don't understand can't install the full drive. "
0	Everyone must be cautious when buying things on JD. If there is a problem, go everywhere by yourself, so they won't care about you, be careful! ! It’s not worrying enough to buy things, you don’t have to worry about buying things on Jingdong! ! ! 
0	I booked the Qiantang River View Standard Room. As soon as I entered the door, I smelled a strong smell of smoke. The so-called River View was basically only two-story weeds; the most unbearable thing was that there were fleas in the room, so that we could only have one night Wearing long clothes, long pants and a good hat to sleep, but the body is still red and itchy from time to time. The software service is good. I don't think I will choose Kaiyuanzhijiang anymore. Health and safety issues when going out are very important. 
0	Just lighter weight. If the 12.1 inch has such a good configuration, the price will be about the same. 
0	Not worth the price. The decoration is average. Outside the hotel is a barbecue street. The breakfast is very simple and there is nothing to eat. Never choose it next time. Refused to even apply for late check-out 
1	Overall good! The room was originally set for 298 yuan, because it only arrived in the early morning, and it was upgraded to a deluxe room on the 15th floor for free. You can also see the sea view. I didn't change my room for three days (Thursday to Sunday). It's worth it! The room facilities are OK, up to 3 stars, but the washbasin tap is leaking. The 16th floor is the restaurant. My room is just below the restaurant. One day, their employees had a party all afternoon! The restaurant upstairs seems to be closed? The Yiqing Building downstairs is said to be a well-known restaurant in Qingdao. It is quite hot and tastes good, and the price is similar to the beer street. There is a big shopping mall 200 meters down, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. Can live! 
1	The breakfast is too bad, all vegetarian dishes. In addition, the concierge also lost a piece of my luggage, only to find it was taken away by someone else, and it took a long time to find it back. Everything else is ok. 
1	The thing is like this, and there will be unexpected results if you change it. Who wants the driver under xp to find me, I have it here 
0	"Samsung's machines are all ""fingerprint"" machines, it is too easy to leave fingerprints. 1G of memory is a bit small, because the chip display eats more than 200M. The price of 3300 is not as good as that of Acer and other machines. The market price of the machine is actually only 3800, and the Jingdong standard is 4000, which gives people the illusion of a lot of discounts. "
0	It's really a fingerprint collector, it's too miserable, it can't be wiped! Also, the battery will be charged if it is plugged in and not removed. I don’t know if this will seriously damage the battery! Asus really should make a switch to control battery mode or DC mode! 
0	The room has a smell, the service is really not flattering, the booked room is sold, but fortunately it is a free upgrade, which is not bad. It’s really annoying that I forgot to leave my clothes at the hotel after checking out. I didn’t remind them to return them when I checked in at the front desk. The luggage was stored for nearly three hours and still not returned until I left Harbin and returned to my parents’ house two days later I found out when I was packing my luggage. I told me that I saw clothes after the phone call. This kind of service is really bad. I have to pay for express delivery if I send the clothes back. 
0	Is a book that teaches girls how to pursue material things, is it worthy of such pursuit by big guys? In this materialistic society, there are fewer and fewer people with spiritual pursuits~ 
0	What is broken 4 stars, the hot water will come after 10 minutes. There is no central air conditioning. Hotel feedback March 26, 2008: There is no central air-conditioning, the information is not true. Hot water may be less for guests to take a bath during the day, and there is some cold water in the pipeline that needs to be drained. This kind of thing will happen in any hotel, please understand! 
0	Very dissatisfied with a hotel!!!! But let’s say something good first: the pick-up is good! Nothing else is good! 1. The flowers and fruits that stayed on the first day were corrupted by someone and disappeared! 2. The soundproofing effect of the room is very poor. At one o'clock that night, I was awakened by the sound of exercise next door, depressed! 3. I arrived at the front desk to check out at 18:03 on the same day. I have to charge me for the whole day! ! Super trash! ! ! 4. General room facilities, beds 
1	I just came back from Wuxi and stayed in the second building of the hotel at 328YUAN. The overall feeling is as follows; the room is clean, well-equipped and has a liquid mirror computer; the food is delicious and not very expensive; the most commendable is the service level, the husband carelessly used the phone It was dropped, and the staff sent it back immediately after picking it up, like it! The hotel staff almost greeted them with smiles, which is rare. This alone indirectly improves the reason for staying in the hotel! 
1	There is no sauna equipment, the reason is that it is being repaired, but the real reason is not making money. 
0	XP drivers are too hard to find. Especially the sound card driver, Asus will not be troubled with this. Not meaningful enough. The CPU is slightly inferior, and it is almost with this graphics card. 
0	Today, I went to paste the film on my laptop, and suddenly found that there was a problem with the network card. I called Jingdong after-sales service. The reminder told me that I was the first to queue, but I waited for 15 minutes and did not wait. I submitted a repair application online. The information is incomplete and depressed. Jingdong's after-sales service is very disappointing! 
1	"This set of books is a gift for children on Children's Day. As the friends who have read it, it is indeed a good set worth buying. When I first got it, I was worried that it would be more difficult for children to read because there is no pinyin. The facts proved that my worries were unnecessary. From the moment it was opened, she was deeply attracted by the prose-like, story-like content. . . I have read the fourth book for a few days, and still refuse to let it go when it's time for bed. . . Woke up this morning, the child opened his eyes and the first sentence was: ""Mom, I like reading! I like my Children's Day gift!"" These words are very gratifying. "
0	It’s a little troublesome to install the system. It took me two hours to update the system software. In addition, the two USBs at the back are too crowded, and they are so close to the power source that they can only connect to a small U disk and read the card. The device is useless. . . . 
0	The room is too small, there is no elevator, the surrounding environment is ok, but the road is being built, it is very noisy 
1	"During the Cultural Revolution, Jin Yong ran a newspaper in Hong Kong. He predicted that current affairs would happen frequently. Everyone asked the reason, and said, ""I have been reading ""Tongzhi Tongjian"" for decades. It is probably the case with Chinese people."" Is this book so amazing? With curiosity, I bit my head. After a year and a half, I finally finished reading it and finally realized that what Jin Daxia said was true. It is true that what happened to the Chinese is true. Although historical phenomena will not be simply repeated, the laws of history always repeat themselves. After reading this book, people feel that their cognitive level has been improved. "
1	The service is not very professional and the processing speed is too slow. However, because of the waiter's small mistake, the assistant manager personally came up to apologize, which is very touching. 
1	My proud smile, my proud smile, is actually a perfect screen, I can't stand it, hehe, great, good character! 
1	Lightweight, low heat. (Compared with the original Compaq M300, X200 is a refrigerator---haha). The running sound is very soft, almost inaudible. 
0	I can only say that this is a book that would definitely not be sold if it were placed in a bookstore. The content is nothing. If you turn a few pages, you will definitely not buy it. 
0	The heat dissipation is not good, the machine will be very hot after a while, no wonder the radiator is sent, the built-in red flag system is very trash! ! ! 
0	In fact, there are still many shortcomings. First of all, the machine is heavier and the price is not cheap, and then the keyboard feels worse and the keyboard layout is not coordinated. Without the keyboard light, the speaker design is really ugly. Because the machine just got it, it’s hard to say anything, other things will be clear in actual use 
1	I feel that this set of books is good. There are small stickers inside. Stick the small stickers on the pages of the book as required by the title. My child is four years old, so it's relatively easy to make this book, and children like to do it. There are not only mathematics, but also training on time and distance. Adults are required to read the questions. Sometimes the description of the title is awkward, and sometimes children cannot understand it. But overall it is good. My child is doing fast. I plan to wait for him to finish these five books before I buy him a 5-year-old one. Each parent chooses the level according to the development of their children. If you have some concepts about mathematics, you can choose one level higher. 
0	I bought this book after reading so many five-star reviews before I bought it. I thought it should be a book worth owning! After reading such a book, in my mind this so-called five-star book really It's terrible! I finally finished reading it after a few nights. The content in the book is about? How to read aloud to cultivate children's interest in reading!? Written, but the book is too boring, a lot of nonsense... I shouldn't write such a long book, and there is a lot of nonsense. I need to read the entire book completely, but I feel very impatient during the process of reading the book. I really don't understand what the author is doing with so much nonsense... .... If parents already know the importance of raising children's interest in reading, there is no need to spend this money to buy this book! The book says that by letting parents read aloud to accompany children's reading interest! I personally think, As long as parents can lead by example and love to read, they will accompany their children to read together with their children since childhood, so that children must have liked books since they were young! 
1	It is cost-effective and meets household needs; I use a deep XP disk with a sata driver, without changing the bios settings, and the installation system is very smooth; I have never encountered a black screen when watching a video. 
0	After buying this set of books, the child didn't have much interest, and only read it a few times. Now I am resting in the drawer. Let her read it slowly. I wonder if she is not used to reading this kind of picture book? 
0	The display cover is a bit protruding outwards and it is not tightly fitted. It feels a bit distorted. The outer surface of the cover is touched by hand, it has a convex and concave feeling. There are pallets that are loose and seem to fall off. The workmanship is not very good anyway! 
1	"In Mr. Sa’s eyes, the Water Margin is not only a literary masterpiece, but also a sociological masterpiece. He puts the Water Margin in the political, economic, and social environment of the Song Dynasty to study. Why did the Liangshan heroes gather together? ""Loyalty"" and ""righteousness"" That's it. The loyalty here is very different from the loyalty of Confucianism. Mr. Sa used the Water Margin as a living blueprint and briefly analyzed the social system and marriage system at that time. It is very insightful. The era of the Water Margin has been nearly a century now, and it is written in the book I think the production and distribution methods of ""Battle House"" and ""Distribution of Banks"" are not worth promoting in contemporary society. "
0	The bathroom equipment is simple, there is no hot water to take a bath, or the hot water is not hot 
0	The promotion of Du Lala is unrealistic. That kind of workplace environment is simply utopia, there are, but too few. For most people, the reference is too small. 
1	I am a meatless person. If I don’t eat some meat every day, I will feel like a rabbit. Of course, if I eat too much, I will feel sick. So how to ensure a reasonable combination of vegetables and meat? The panic about eating meat is something I often consider. So, I bought this book, hehe, not bad. The pictures and texts, as well as warm reminders, make people have unlimited taste associations. However, it is worthy of caution, especially not to read this book before going to bed. I have tried it twice, and it feels uncomfortable to have an empty stomach. 
0	The pillow is too low to sleep, but it’s fine in a place like Zhumadian 
1	It’s the first time I heard that natural ugliness can also be transformed into artistic beauty. I was really surprised. Although I was still young, I couldn’t read it very well, but it has benefited a lot from middle school students now. They have a persistent view of beauty and are very objective. They sometimes admire vanity, but never think about what is true beauty. I haven't finished reading it yet. This book was recommended to us by the head teacher. It is a great honor to read this book. Book, thank you Mr. Zhu Guangqian and thank you teacher! 
1	It looks good and beautiful. The memory DDR3 is very good. The configuration is very cheap. I have a Samsung DDR3 1066. 
1	I bought it for a company engineer, and after a few days I asked him how he felt? Seeing him smiling and telling me that it was good, I knew it was really good. It is very useful for handling daily work, going to the customer’s presentation, connecting to a high-end server, etc. Another: he was discovered by the boss and playing games with a new laptop,,,, the boss thought that he was upgraded to a high-end machine~~~ 
0	Hey, it’s almost enough to read it again, whoever wants to transfer it to someone, even from Wuhan, if you need it, contact me qq42950063 
1	The last time I bought the book on Dangdang, only this one was the most worthwhile. Mr. Nan is really knowledgeable and his ancient writing is not good. If you want to understand the spirit of traditional culture, you can start by reading the works of Mr. Nan Huaijin. Many people write books and talk about nonsense in other books without comprehending and verifying. For Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, Mr. Nan not only concentrates on the study of the classics, but also cultivates according to his own understanding to see if the classics are right. This is too male. To share with you my experience and feelings of reading Mr. Nan's works. 
1	The location is better, and it’s got a free upgrade. It feels better, but the price is too high. 
0	"The room light is very dark, the carpet is dirty, a cockroach was found and trampled to death! Toothpaste is fake. Don’t use towels. I believe you won’t use it. You have to bring your own. When I checked in, I heard a person like a manager and another tour guide say: ""Let them complain about this little thing."" I suddenly regretted being in such a place! If Ctrip still has 0 points, I will give them all 0 points. I suggest you spend more money, drive more cars, and choose another place to stay! "
1	The room booked for a friend is said to be pretty good, so I will try it myself. 
0	The location is really bad, it is in the urban-rural fringe. There is no sense of service. It is completely impossible to go out and call a car. After eating fried eggs for breakfast, one hour later, I took turns looking for the toilet with my companions. It took 1 day to get better. . . . Additional comments May 4, 2008: It is estimated that many downstairs are vests, and some people say that this hotel is good. 
0	Maybe it was Premier Zhou who stayed in the room. The room is simple and the furnishings and services are simple, but the breakfast is good 
1	After reading this book in one breath, I really envy the heroine to get such feelings. Whether it is the forest owner, Wei, or even Yang, they are all such male protagonists who can easily make people's hearts excited, and she has easily obtained them. It is really hard to say whether love is given or gained. Although it is wrong to deceive the heroine in good faith, the final ending of Brother Lin still makes me sad. It's so distressed that it's so distressed that it's so hard to bear the injustice of heaven. Imagine if Brother Lin finally recovered and walked towards the heroine with open arms, what would the story end? If it were, who would I choose? Really nice 
1	Located near Wuxi Commercial Street, very close to the railway station. Very convenient. The nearby gourmet shops can also be reached on foot. very convenient. The rooms are quite satisfactory, decorated in pure wood color, very comfortable. I don't like the green carpet, but it is also the first choice for many star hotels. Booking through Ctrip, you can surf the Internet for free (50 yuan/day), which is a pleasant surprise. There are also two drinks for free. Happy. The small bath package tastes good. like very much. The slippers are also very beautiful. Good service and fast action. The most interesting thing is that the light entering the door can't be turned on. I called and asked and replied that the light was an emergency light and could not be turned off. It can only be turned off with the main power switch. If you must turn it off, we can ask the engineering department to help you remove the bulb. That's so cute. Laughing badly at me. The lobby is relatively small. But the elevator is fast. The breakfast variety is okay, Chinese, Japanese, Western, and Japanese miso soup can be added by yourself. I like it very much. I have written so much without knowing it, in one sentence: satisfactory, five-star standard. Convenient location, optional for business. Hotel Feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for your support to this hotel! Recently, the hotel has launched a new guest room promotion on weekends. We will continue to maintain the 5-star service standard. Welcome you to stay again and sincerely wish you good health and smooth work! 
0	Stayed here many times in the past 18 months. This could be a good place to stay if the hotel would maintain the facilities, but they did not. The last two times I stayed (Feb and March) the shower and TV did not work EVEN after I reported them. Will not stay here from now on! 宾馆反馈 2008年5月16日 ： Thanks your problem , We will chang the shower and Tv ,I will hope you come here again 
0	We stayed for 3 nights in total. I had clearly indicated that I wanted a high-rise room before booking. It was only after 4 o'clock when the day arrived. The hotel arranged for us a room on the first floor without windows on the grounds that the room had already been opened. It was handled by a male receptionist. , And completely ignored my reservation request. Because my family is an elderly person, they feel very suffocated without windows, and there are so many mosquitoes like flying a plane. After half an hour, I came to the front desk and asked for a room change. Another male front desk changed a room without saying a word, but it was still on the first floor, which was good for ventilation. But still grab a handful of mosquitoes, the hotel explained: Xiamen is famous for mosquitoes this season. Next, I called Ctrip to request coordination, but it did not succeed. I wanted to change a hotel, but the elderly didn't want to toss, so on the third day, I changed a room on the second floor for us. I think Ctrip should pay attention to the customer's reservation needs and require the hotel to meet it. If it can't be satisfied, the customer must be informed, otherwise it will be a sulking feeling when going to the hotel, and there will be no interest in traveling. 
0	There is no phonetic transcription of the words in the book, which is a huge flaw in this book. It is not convenient for readers to spell it, let alone easy to remember. Unfortunately, if I return the goods without money, I will return it! 
0	The classic black, the quality of Lenovo is not so bad, I think it is still very small, maybe some people have ulterior motives, haha! 
0	The facilities are aging and the road close to the road is too noisy. At night, the sound of the water flowing in the bathroom upstairs and the noise of the air-conditioning were very loud, and I couldn't sleep. After reporting to the reception, the waiter arrived late and emphasized that it was so. It is recommended to stay at Anqing Hotel in the development zone and Jinjiang Inn on Renmin Road in the urban area 
1	"I don't think many people will be interested in this book, but I hope that friends who see it can find it and read it. The text is very simple, and the length is not long. It remembers the people, things, legends, and feelings in the bumps. The text is very interesting, just a few words and a leisurely meaning. Su Shi is a great master, not only because of his literary achievements, but also because of his inner naivety. He is open-minded and optimistic everywhere in ""Dongpo Zhilin"", missing the loveliness of his relatives and friends. Watching one or two before going to bed, I feel that Dongpo is like a friend around him, he is sincere, he is superstitious, his back is so sad and his heart is so warm. This is a good book, a really good book. "
1	The appearance, keyboard, performance and battery are all pretty good, but I just can’t get into the system and I’m depressed. The hard drive is creaking and there is a suspected problem. Although someone upstairs said that the F9 import system can solve the problem, but I didn’t know it during the inspection, and Jingdong’s after-sales service did not mention this method. I exchanged the product directly, or replaced it with a new insurance. 
0	This three-star is really bad. The air conditioner in the room was very low at first, but there was no air conditioner. Then the air conditioner was broken when I pulled it down. The room I lived in was full of musty smell and the bed was moldy. Don’t I stayed at this hotel, I didn't fall asleep all night, it was too bad. Breakfast was nothing to eat, it was a mess. The attitude of service meta is not bad. 
0	Vista system does not partition. gosh. I don't know why the manufacturer does this. Now that the product has been developed, simple things will be done smoothly for their insiders. If we don’t partition, we have to do it for a long time, especially for girls who don’t understand computers. Vista is not used to it. 
1	I arrived at night on the 7th and withdrew at noon on the 9th. The Russian-style two-story villas scattered among the green trees. The environment is quiet, quiet, but they scream too vigorously (they don’t rest until about 12 o’clock in the evening, and they wake up at 6 o’clock in the morning to sing. ). 5 or 6 minutes away from the sea. The environment of the Vasily Tavern in the hotel is not to mention, and the price is cheap, and the Russian taste is also very authentic, but the dishes are a bit less. Because it is also a sanatorium for foreign experts, there are more Russians. The breakfast is so-so, the milk is thinner and the egg is put for a long time, but after eating it for two days, I can get used to it. I should talk about some unsatisfactory places. The room has been unoccupied for a long time. It was very damp, and the bathing suits were not dry until I left. The facilities are old, but they are still very clean and the waiters are very nice. Overall it's good, but I don't think it can reach the 3-star standard except for the price. Additional comments August 10, 2008: Because I was not satisfied with the breakfast, I did not go to the restaurant for dinner. 
0	The screen hinge is a bit loose, I don’t know if it’s an example. The battery life is really average. I can’t find the card reader driver online. 
0	Too bad, the room is small, there is a charge for parking at the door, the musty smell in the room is very strong, I don't know how those who say good things experience it. 
1	I stayed in the Chinese-style big bed room of the hotel. The room environment and service quality are good, but the floor is low, on the 4th floor (the entire hotel is only 5 floors high), and the overall is good, but the breakfast served is not a buffet. It is a 10 yuan meal coupon for the restaurant on the second floor, which is very inconvenient for one person. 
1	1. The location and environment are good 2. Breakfast is ok 3. The service is good, especially the indoor swimming pool facilities are more comfortable 4. The room is relatively old, especially the slippers are too thin, not like a four-star hotel 
1	Women of any age and career can find a new self through this book. The author uses a humorous tone and her own experience to tell us about her emotional journey and the food and culture of the countries she traveled around. After laughing, people can't help but admire everything she sees and gains. Perhaps as we grow older we are no longer young and beautiful, but we can have an eternal young heart and happiness, and be a happy girl forever! 
0	The heat dissipation is not very good, and the system is really. . . . . ! ! Why should it be Vista! ! ! ! ! 
1	The long one is beautiful, the pure white color is very good, and the heat dissipation of the computer is much better than that of other brands of notebooks. 
0	The content of the article is seriously out of touch with reality. Although the novel allows fiction, it shouldn't be so. And the narrative plot is very confusing. Although I can understand it in the end, it makes people dizzy and uncomfortable after reading it. 
0	It just feels a bit thick, ha, and the system is too annoying, ha ha, there is an extension area that can't be separated by PQ in the repartitioning, and I don't know how to make it! Depressed! 
0	Personally, I don’t like this book very much. The protagonist’s story is too fake...a poor girl from the countryside, with at most an elementary school culture, under the guidance of an aristocratic old lady for a year or two, she can be a psychology after reading a psychology course. Teacher? Too mysterious...not true 
1	The author's viewpoint is unique and his language is sharp. It profoundly summarizes the right and wrong grievances between men and women, and explains the old grievances accumulated by men and women in their lives. The downside of this book is that the following chapters are similar, and the more you read it, the more boring you feel, but I still want to thank the author for taking us to tour the instinctive world of men and women! Hehe, readers are suggested to take a look, if there is one, change it, and if there is none, make more encouragement! ! 
1	I am an old IBM user, T series is my favorite. Although there is a LENOVO mark, all the materials used in the design are the consistent style of T series. 
1	After using it for a while, I caught up with the hard drive's WD, there is no stuck phenomenon, temperature control is also good, in short, it is a very cost-effective notebook. 
0	Room type: Riverview double business room/2006, 2008 (440 yuan/day, room) Room service: The waiter was very good, but very picky. They found out that the little towel I deliberately made dirty and asked me to pay 5 yuan (I like to play in every hotel), the tolerance is too low. It is recommended that guests who must stay in the hotel bring their own face towels. Front desk service: check-in, check-out and reception are very good in time! Very cultivated! Guest room: The indoor temperature is too high to be adjusted. It is okay to open the windows all night, but the boiler room below is very loud. If you want to go out, you must dress quickly, otherwise, you will sweat (the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is about 50 degrees)! The floor seems clean, and it is easy to bring hair on to bed if you are not careful (but the bedding is snow-white and super clean! Very fine hair can be displayed clearly). You can see the sunset from the Songhua River Sun Island outside the window! Breakfast: super bad, poor variety (much worse than Samsung), such as milk can only be said to be milky boiling water (very cold). The celery used for the celery cuts is yellow, and it must have been on display for quite a few days. The waiter in the restaurant was listless except for the breakfast ticket. 
0	"I bought 10 books in Dangdang this time. Among them, my ""Parents Are the Best Doctors for Children"" and ""The Wisdom of the Elderly Don't Get Sick"", and two of the ""Seeking a Doctor Is Better Than Oneself"" have uneven cuts. Fuzzy. Many words in the book are not clearly printed!! I thought that these books are worth reading, so I bought genuine products to collect, but I didn't expect Dangdang to sell counterfeit goods, which is even more high-quality than Taobao. It's worse, and the price is two or three times that of others. Last time other colleagues bought ""Wisdom Not Sick"" on Taobao, and there was no quality problem mentioned above! Although it is free of mail, the cost is high, but You can't buy fake goods to sell, and then increase the profit! It's really annoying! I advise consumers to think carefully before buying! "
0	The media is hyping too much. I usually don't have time to watch TV. I bought a book in admiration and respectfully read it, only to find that it is actually so-so. 
0	"Today, I will finish reading the ""Law of Fairness"" exclusively released by Dangdang.com. I am disappointed! Especially when I look back and compare the super nasty preface written by the recommender Wang Hongwei (what does this person do?), it is really disgusting. It is understandable that Sun Yingui who wrote this book is a person who has not graduated from elementary school after all. Although he has made money, he should be regarded as a successful person in the business society. But after all, the writing is not enough and the ability to control the writing is limited. If you can talk to Mr. Sun Chat, it is estimated that they will understand the meaning of what they want to express more clearly. However, writing a book, especially summing up a ""law"" is really incomprehensible, and Xianglin's wife talked about it for a long time. It can be priced at 33 yuan. I can only say ""I take you!"" to friends in the publishing industry. "
1	The books are of good quality and trustworthy; in addition, Jingdong's service is indeed fast and the service attitude is also very good. give it a like! ! ! ! 
1	The battery is quite durable, the keyboard feels and the size is also very good, the LED screen looks comfortable, and the transmission speed of the hard disk is very fast. 
1	This book is easy to understand. I think the biggest help to me is to let me understand the growth process of people-mainly the growth in different aspects of infancy, so that I have a better understanding of my children in real life. When I was embarrassed and shameless, although I used different methods to solve it, I was inevitably upset and sad. After reading this book, when I face my child, I won’t have a headache anymore, he His different performances are in line with his age characteristics at this time. I will understand him better, appreciate and analyze him patiently, and adjust myself to be a better mother. 
1	The configuration is not bad relative to the price. The built-in LUIX system is useless at all. Fortunately, my colleague is a computer expert, and I can get XP in more than half an hour. 
1	"This is a strange book. `It’s its courage, anti-feudal, anti-ethical education, is the May Fourth Movement meaningful? If the ""junjun, ministers, fathers, sons, and sons"" begin to be re-evaluated today, then Tan Sitong ""please follow Sitong"" Why did the group of promising young people sacrificed for? The so-called ""Twenty-Four History"" fabricated by the ruling classes of the past generations are all fake histories of ruling Lu Xun said, ""Open...All I see ""Cannibalism? These two words..."" I don't want to say anything but hope that people who are blinded and numb with their eyes have a good look at this precious courage of free spirit.'' "
0	The original 1G memory is too little, the integrated graphics performance is average, the touchpad is relatively stiff and not easy to use, the webcam has low pixels, and the photos are obviously grainy. It is a bit depressing to have only a c drive, and the interface is relatively small, but it is basically enough. 
0	The worst and most depressing business trip ever: *********Yatai Hotel, Jilin Province, at 10:00 am on September 20th, entered the Yatai Hotel, Jilin Province through Ctrip, at 12:00 pm on September 21st. 40 Check out, the front desk informed the room that the items are damaged, let me go back to the room. It was found that the door of the closet used to put clothes had a damaged skin about 5 cm, which was glued back to its original shape with transparent glue. God! ! ! When I checked in, I didn't find out that the hotel attendant, room manager, and the director of the decoration at the scene said that I broke it. The attitude was extremely brutal. They asked me to pay 150 yuan and don't want to leave without money! I rely on! ! ! Swear to God, if I did it, would I not compensate? At 13:00 on September 21, I dialed 110 to report to the police! 110 police arrived and took the person back to the police station to inquire and record a statement. I asked for fingerprints to clear the grievance. . . At 14:30 pm on September 21, the head of the security department of the Yatai Hotel in Jilin Province arrived, handed cigarettes and said something nice: Why do small things make a big deal! I rely on: Am I willing to call the police? I'm free? Shit? In the past few years, I went to Changchun on business many times and lived in Yuefu. There has never been such a thing. Yuefu has recently been renovated. The city of Changchun, the impression in my mind, was completely destroyed! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! At 15:00 pm on September 21, I returned to the hotel and settled again. In the end, there was no compensation of 150 yuan. . . 15:30 Invoicing and leaving the shop, there was a delay of nearly three hours. Super depressed! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Please pay attention to all guests who intend to stay in Yatai Hotel in Jilin Province. Be careful of planting and blackmailing. If a similar situation occurs, call 110 immediately! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I hope that the leaders of the Yatai Group can experience it and eliminate bad trends! ! ! ! 
1	"I have boundless expectations for one of them. ""The Cabin on the Prairie"", no one will know. How long I have been looking for it. I was still a teenager. I have watched the series of the same name. Since then, I wanted to get this book, but I still couldn't get what I wanted. , Including Beijing Wangfujing Bookstore, unexpectedly, I encountered it on Dangdang. There is a feeling that you can't find a place to walk through the iron shoes, and you have no time and effort. Thanks Dangdang. "

1	According to online reviews, I booked a 400-day standard room. I went to the store and told Ctrip that I could only live in the northwest facing room. I felt a bit musty and asked to change the room. After the change, the northwest facing floor was higher and the musty smell was less; room windows and furniture , The toilets are all old models, not of good grade, the bed is very comfortable; the service is good, I feel that the floor is better than the front desk service; the surrounding environment of the hotel is really good, there are mountains and seas, I almost fell off the cliff when I was walking in the back mountain, I suggest the hotel It is too dangerous to add signs and fences on the back mountain halfway in time! Walking and playing with children at night is more dangerous! 
1	The room is very large, and there is a balcony with a sea view. The beach is just outside the hotel, which is very nice. The only regret is that it is not convenient to use UnionPay cards. 
0	I checked in on the winter solstice day, and I felt sick when I arrived at the hotel. The hotel has 2 doors and it feels weird. The lights in the elevator are dim. I live in a business room and feel chills as soon as I walk in. I feel uncomfortable and I changed rooms later. There were 6 people with me, 4 of them felt weird just like me. Later, we didn't dare to sleep alone and asked for a double room. The facilities in the guest rooms are also very depressing. The TV cabinet is like a big box, as if someone comes out of it at any time. There are two big black balls on the cabinet and the head of the bed, as if eyes are staring at you. A colleague said that the lampshade in her room was black and the light was always dim. 
0	The facilities of this hotel are outdated, it is not a star hotel, it can only be regarded as a guest house. The room is small and the floor is shaking when walking. In short, my impression of staying here is average. Will not consider it again next time! 
1	The book is good, the price is cheap, the fever is not big, the function is complete, it can fully meet the family entertainment and common uses. 
1	The unique piano lacquer mirror surface is very different. At first, it was glued on and thought it was scratches. It was a false alarm; it has the usual thick feeling of Thinkpad, although it is a low-end product of this brand, it is better than other brands. 
1	I bought this book when I was very tired from work and when my health was very bad. Anti-inflammatory drugs and antipyretics to remove gunpowder were usually taken, but it was a temporary pain. At that time, I didn't know how to recover my body. I just bought this book, pressed Taichong acupoint as the book said, sleep more, and gradually found the confidence to restore health. I really agree with Wu Qingzhong’s views on physical health. It was after this book that a series of books by Zhongliba were published and a batch of TCM health care books were sold. It should be said that Teacher Wu Qingzhong is a real wise man. , Starting the right trend of body care 
1	The packaging and quality are very good, and readers who like her are worth buying this collection. Sanmao's life is full of legends, but always so sincere and passionate. I have always pursued to be such a person, but I don't have so much courage. Although her life is short, it is extremely wonderful and true, leaving more of the regret and miss of her readers. A delicate woman narrates her real world for us with free and easy handwriting. 
1	For me who are not very demanding, this model is sufficient for notebooks. Although I am not used to a slightly squeezed keyboard at first, it will be fine for a long time. 
1	As far as the content of the book is concerned, it is worse than the animation, and it feels like an introduction to the animated version. But it is worthwhile to reduce the time children watch TV. 
0	The conditions are not enough for the star rating, only the price does not allow Samsung, the old house, old facilities, old decoration, the room is very old, it is recommended that Ctrip can explain the room situation when booking, and will definitely not live here in the future. 
0	It happened that my major and health care were very close, so I paid more attention to this hot book and purchased several similar hot books including this one. After reading it carefully, I feel that everyone should go to the hospital for clinical diagnosis and treatment if they are in physical conditions. Although the process is difficult and expensive, it is reliable, at least much more reliable than this book. The score should be less than 50 points. 
1	Temporarily decided to go to Beijing for a business trip, and it was quickly booked. The room was good. I stayed for two nights. It is the most economical place near here, and the quality is the best! 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, it can be seen that it has been a lot of work, the white is also very suitable for MM, the configuration is good, and it is relatively balanced, and it can be used for a while 
0	Haven't read it yet, and publish it after reading it. I think many people have a strong impression of this book and believe in the public's perspective. Hehe~~ 
0	The heat dissipation is not good, and the temperature on the touchpad is high. The xp system is very difficult to install. The first-installed dos system has not installed xp for most of the day. It always prompts that there is a problem with the hard disk. Then I called the customer service and realized that I had to set the BIOS to IDE, and the xp driver was not provided. , Need to go online. 
0	"The battery life is not very good, only one and a half hours. I don’t know how to start the ""ASUS Splendid Color Technology"" mentioned in the introduction. "
0	1 The attitude of the front desk is poor, always telling that there is no standard room, and the preferential price of the front desk is in my opinion to induce guests to stay at a high standard; 2 The room facilities are outdated, poorly maintained, the temperature is not up in winter, and frequent harassment calls are made. 3 The efficiency of check-out procedures is low; I know Changchun better. This hotel is a little closer to the train station. Others have no advantage at all. Moreover, there are many express hotels near the train station, so I recommend choosing other ones. It is recommended that Ctrip clear this hotel, and Ctrip should regularly inspect and clean up some unqualified hotels, otherwise it will affect the satisfaction of Ctrip's reservation. 
0	As soon as I got this book, I was snatched by my colleague to read it, and it was returned to me the next day. Surprised! It turned out that she finished watching it all night. . . . Also communicated with me for a long time. After reading it, I felt very touching. Some of the stories in it seemed to have happened before. In general, it is a good workplace reference book 
1	I saw nothing strange at first, but as I progressed step by step, I realized that all this was just a pavement. When the ending stepped on this blanket, although I knew who it was, I was still full of curiosity and wondered how it would be. Come on! However, this is not the most moving. What is really thought-provoking is the inner philosophy of life. A person who is only 80 years old in his life may be strong and may be able to live over 100 years old. No concealment and effort can conceal this truth. One cannot just live. In selfish desire, don't just do what you want to do, but also learn to do what should be done. After all, the time has passed and he will never come back. 
0	The fever is indeed not low, and the temperature distribution is uneven. Normally, the wind at the standby air outlet is quite hot, around 59° CPU (ambient 22°). If the weather is hot again, it is necessary to add a cooling base. In addition, there is only for vista driver in the original driver CD. The performance of the SIS chipset is poor. 
0	The condition of the room is really average, and it feels very old. Our room is also right on this parking lot. Breakfast is not very good, very few types. It is a 3-star standard, but the price is very expensive. I accidentally saw Xinghai Holiday Hotel when I went to Shengya Ocean World. It looked very good outside, and I paid a lot of money to book this. 
1	But can the cover of the book be more gentle? Ha ha. 
1	Pretty! The weight is light and the external power supply is also very light. The keyboard is large enough to use. Compared with other netbooks, it comes with a white bag. You don’t need to buy additional random games and photo stickers. Interesting. The notebook has a low temperature and is not hot to use. Fortunately, the general Internet application is enough for the wireless network card signal and the battery life is long. The general Internet application is more than 5 hours under the lowest brightness, Bluetooth and wireless network card are turned off. The drivers have been installed. The camera will be available during the day and night. Use it like a ghost film Genuine winXP Home Edition 
0	Too dirty, the parking lot is too small, it is recommended that Ctrip do not recommend such a hotel 
0	Rubbish, quite rubbish, a lot of 1 and 2 are repetitive, not to mention, always buy off, what this detailed content depends on how many pages of the second book, that content depends on where the first book. There are countless such things. It feels like letting you buy his books in a disguised form, the method is quite cheap. And the words are too thin... 
1	It is a good book in the pastime. If it’s a biography, it’s okay, but in this case, there are too many people involved in this biography. Is it Chiang Kai-shek’s biography or Miss Kong Er’s? Of course this is a joke. The book is a good book, and it doesn't comment too much on history. Surely the person who wrote the book was a Communist Party member? So you have to hesitate. Oh, by the way, when reading this book, don't think of it as an inspirational one. The reason is also mentioned above. Together, these two books are quite thick, and they are of the kind of large format. 
0	I stayed in this hotel during the medical exhibition. The room facilities are still relatively new. But the hotel does not supply hot water from the time I entered to the day I stayed. Think about the price of more than a thousand, and I lost it. It is shameless to repair the pipeline in Dalian. I have confirmed that many of my friends’ hotels during the same period have not been affected. The hotel’s explanation is very reluctant. When I booked, I guaranteed it with a credit card, and they did not cancel my stay, nor Give a discount, when I said force majeure (our flight landed in Shenyang due to weather, the hotel did not cancel the reservation for us, causing us to take a taxi to Dalian overnight!!) This is angry. Ctrip is also very bad, even such a big thing Don’t tell me. All in all, it’s so shameless to stay here. Additional comment April 14, 2007: I forgot to say that this hotel charges too much, 0.8 yuan per minute when surfing the Internet, it’s robbery. 
0	There are too few USB ports and the location is not user-friendly! The high-definition audio driver under XP is not available on the official website. You can download it from the NVIDIA website. 
0	It’s a pity that this LINUX system requires the trouble of reinstalling the system with a U disk, but if it weren’t for this system, there would be no such price. 
1	It’s difficult to install XP, but Vista is installed. Excellent price/performance ratio, beautiful appearance, and good performance! ! 
1	The workmanship is better, and the details are also better. A large external monitor is a good choice. 
1	I haven’t visited the mall before. I didn’t think it was so light and I like it. I changed to XP. The speed is very good. There is absolutely no problem with ordinary use. The independent 128 graphics card can handle ordinary games. 
1	From a more objective and true perspective, it describes a living historical figure-Li Si and the environment in which he is located. No one can get rid of the historical background he is in. People who have passed more than 2,000 years are the ones we face today. There is a world of difference in the situation, but the human nature in it has not changed much. For the sake of official career, it is bloody. Maybe history is difficult to restore its authenticity, only close to the original appearance, just like the characters in the book, never will Understand, why he made such a decision at some point. Reading this book, you will understand a form of official career, but it is not the only way. 
0	1. The painting style is unpleasant, very rough, and the brushwork is not smooth 2. Most of the content is outdated, and the regionality is obvious3. The author is rich in imagination, but too far away from reality4. The price is higher 5. Kids don't like it 
1	"I bought the Smurfs series (first series) for his son some time ago, and he likes to watch it fanatically. As long as it is free time, he will hold a book and read it carefully. On the sofa, on the bed, on the car, on the toilet; before breakfast, after dinner, and before going to bed, he was immersed in the happy world of the Smurfs. Every day when I get home, I hear him excitedly say: ""Mom, I have met a new Smurf, its name is..."". So this time he bought the second album without hesitation, and he still likes it as always. If you have children aged 3-7, it is recommended to have one! "
1	This hotel has a good location, a bit of a quiet feeling, and the transportation is more convenient; the most happy thing is that the hotel upgraded us to the topmost suite for free, which is great, with a big living room, and the room is not small, in Hong Kong I have never stayed in a hotel with such a large room. I didn't want to leave after staying for two days. I still want to stay in. I will choose YMCA next time. 
0	1. Memory is 1G, which is too small 2. No operating system. 3. With fingerprint recognition, but there is no related program. 4. Hard disk revolutions are too low. 
1	The hotel's service awareness is very good, very enthusiastic, and take the initiative to introduce the characteristics of the hotel. It feels good. 
1	Online shopping is risky. You should be cautious when you start. It is indeed cheaper than the store. To paraphrase what the customer service said to me: sir, in general, you are too lucky. I started with the screen with a dead pixel, and the return policy was not enough for 5 dead pixels. I was depressed, and I thought I was unlucky! If you apply Xiao Shenyang's point of view, you can't take this issue too seriously. The heat is really big, and my Dell’s notebook is not so hot. It is recommended to use it with a good heat sink, the heat sink sent is very rubbish! ! 
0	The screen is relatively low, I still have a bright spot, I don’t think I have to change it, it seems that the price is no way, save the cost 
1	"I read it carefully, no matter from the teaching ideas, the grammar explanation or the answers to the exercises, they are very complete. Listening comprehension, dialogue practice. In particular, there are some points that need to be paid attention to by the teacher, ""Please do not teach new words here, you will naturally understand the new words after you have learned the ""dialogue""."" Introduce stories, understand situations, listening goals, etc. Very detailed. It is a rare and good book. "
0	The keyboard feels a little worse; the white shell is easy to get dirty (hehe, beautiful price); the brand is not as good as the first-line (of course the price is also low); the after-sales outlets are less than those of Lenovo and other brands 
0	The location was on the edge of the crossroads, it was very noisy, and the bus hulled until 11 o'clock at night. The room is small and the toiletries are incomplete: body soap, shampoo and hand soap are three in one, which is not easy to use. Bad service attitude. When inquiring on the phone, you always listen to music and wait for a long time, and then hang up your phone for no reason. Forget me a breakfast. 
0	The soundproofing is too bad, as if the window is open. It's noisy to sleep. Don't dare to live here again on a business trip. Room facilities are okay, bed bedding is clean 
1	I went to Lanzhou City for the first time and booked the Friendship Hotel on Ctrip.com. This is a hospitality hotel of the former municipal party committee. The building should have history. I stayed in the Jiabin Building, and the facilities in the standard room were OK, clean and tidy. The main disadvantage of the room is that the TV is relatively old, there are fewer TV stations, and the signal is not good, but it is not a big problem for me not to watch TV. The plain white sheets and cleanness of the bathroom still make me feel good about the room overall. After the gate of the hotel, there is a bustling commercial street nearby, especially the Cai Genxiang and Jinding Beef Noodles are very good. Not far to the west, there is a very good Internet cafe on the third floor of the Southeast Building at Dunhuang intersection. Opposite the hotel is the Provincial Museum, and the surrounding environment is prosperous and convenient. 
0	I picked this book on the five-star ranking list. After I bought it, I found that not only the baby didn’t like it, but I couldn’t even read it myself. I didn’t know how so many people would give it to my jumping thinking and difficult words. Rating five stars. 
1	The hotel is suitable for vacations. There is a free shuttle bus to and from Hankow Road in Tsim Sha Tsui every hour. The room size is moderate and you can lie on the bed to watch the sea. My son doesn't want to come up in the swimming pool and lacks bathrobe. Breakfast is ok. 
1	The friends who used the notebook in the early stage and the surroundings learned a lot, and finally bought G430M. It is generally very good and all indicators are suitable. I like its touch-type tuning keys. The overall shape and workmanship are better than I thought. The chip is updated quickly. Under the circumstances, this is currently the best choice. awesome??? 
0	I didn't receive this book. I obviously bought it with another one and the service was not good. At least let me know this situation! 
1	Very nice hotel has stayed many times 
1	I went to the Songjiang distribution point to pick up the goods, and when I checked it, I saw a place under the display screen that the black paint faded seriously. I bought it for a friend, in depression. 
1	I went home again and saw that the child’s perspective is really different from that of our adults. My niece actually likes the car more. Ha ha, I’m more optimistic about it, he’s not interested in it, and brushing his teeth. As soon as she saw the book, she brushed her fingers on the only three teeth. Haha, it should be teething, this action can just grind the teeth 
0	"Friends who come to Suzhou, think about it, recommend the Royal Court, who makes it close. I remembered when I arrived at the door. I haven't booked yet. I immediately dialed 4008206666, and the car arrived at the door. The guard asked: Is there a reservation? Answer: Booking is in progress. Please raise the railing and we will go to the front desk. Guard: No. Q: Why? Doorman: Cannot enter without a reservation. Q: We can make a reservation directly at the front desk. Doorman: No, there is no room. Q: How do you know? We are contacting the front desk, and your elder brother calls to ask, or let us go in and ask directly, if there is no room, we turn around and leave, and you have nothing to lose. Doorman: Just no, there is no room, and there are regulations that you cannot enter without reservation. Question: Then I tell you that I have a reservation, can I go in? ...... But no matter how we explain, there is no way to move a step. At this time, a car came from behind and wanted to enter the hotel. As my car was blocked, no one could get in. At this time, Ctrip's call has been answered, the room has been booked, and you can move in immediately. He also received a notice from the front desk, so he lifted the bar to release the car, but he didn't even apologize, and didn't feel that he was doing something wrong. At this time, the fire in my heart had burned to the top of my head, and it was really uncontrollable, so I shouted at him a few words, ""Why do you say there is no room?"" Fortunately, my friends didn't care. But for such management, such a service attitude is really annoying. If the doorman makes a phone call to the front desk of the hotel, it is easy to know if there is a room, and doing so will not do any good to the hotel itself. Obviously, the room is not sold. Is the hotel so wealthy and the shop bullies its customers? Hotel feedback August 14, 2008: Thank you for choosing and staying at Suzhou Regalia Hotel Apartments. Your valuable comments have attracted great attention. Our hotel will continue to work hard and actively improve to create a beautiful, warm Comfortable living environment, sincerely thank you for your support to our hotel. "
1	I can only say that it is very good! Super cost-effective! The decoration and location of the hotel are very good, the attached facilities are also very complete, the service is also very attentive, can't help but change the itinerary to stay for a few more days, although it is a bit far from the downtown area, but the environment of Zhongshan Mausoleum There is nothing to say! The only drawback is that the windows were not opened for a few minutes on the first day. There were more mosquitoes flying in, and the hotel had no good countermeasures. Just go to Nanjing and live here in the future! 
1	It's definitely super three-star standard, it's located in a commercial area, it's very convenient for shopping, and there is a sheep grocery store right across the door, absolutely authentic. Except that the price is slightly more expensive, overall it is very satisfactory 
1	The best value at this price, the configuration is reasonable, the online document high-definition 1080p simple game can handle it, the workmanship is OK, the hand is a perfect screen, the heating noise is not large, the screen axis is very strong, worthy of 2999 
1	The driver on the Internet, but obviously not as good as the red flag dazzle! But I don’t play any big games. I just watch movies and go online, which is enough! Value for money. Comrades who don't know how to install programs can find out how to install them by searching online. Not too much trouble. 
1	The room is fairly tidy and spacious. I live in a standard double bed room, but the shower halter in the bathroom is not very good, the water is uneven, and the bath is uncomfortable. The service was not bad. It was 11 o'clock in the morning when I arrived at the hotel, which allowed me to check in early, and the checkout speed was relatively fast without any delay. The hotel is close to Metro 13, which is fairly convenient. 
1	Very close to the airport, the bed in the room is very big, there is a mirror inside 
0	Comment on a bird~~~~~ I ordered three times and complained but never sent it to me twice. I don’t even know what the book looks like! Every time I complained, I just said I’m sorry. I didn’t solve the problem at all. I didn’t have a book and I just mailed it to others. It took three months before and after. I ordered a few times, forget it, no more. . 
0	No practical use. If you see that the author is a Korean, I will definitely not buy it. It's not that I discriminate against Koreans. It's really a different country! 
0	"Suspected repair machine! Reasons: 1. The film of music shortcuts on the keyboard has 6 scratches. 2. The ""IGRS"" film in the lower right corner is turned over. 3. All the screws on the bottom surface have been screwed down, and the paint has obviously fallen off. "
1	The performance of the machine is good. The price is relatively high. Also give 1G memory, so it becomes 2G memory. It's okay to run Vista, but vista occupies more system resources, but it's more dazzling. It is recommended to install win xp or win 7 beta. 
0	"I heard that Yu Dan is very popular, so I bought this book to have a look. I have read ""The Analects"" before, and when I got it, I was disappointed and nothing new. ""The Analects of Confucius"" is like food, this book is porridge for children. If you just want to know more about it, you can read this book. To truly understand the spirit of the Analects, let's read the original text. This book is just fast food. "
1	Hahahaha! Yes, I was forced to fall in love with reading history. Since I was very young, I like reading books and do not like history books. It feels that they are too heavy. The history of China makes us naive and worried. With her grief, regret and indignation..... a friend recommended me this book for me to read. From the bottom of my heart, I reject it. I don’t have to study history and I don’t have to deliberately force myself. When I read this book, I am caught The book was fascinated, I finished reading in one night, and then read it again, no, I will buy it and read it well...Thank you to the author of this book for making me fall in love with history! 
0	At first, I didn't intend to see an interview with Dan on TV, so I bought her book hopefully. After watching it, I feel far away from the lecture on TV! Disappointed! 
1	Novel: Long live youth, activities change human form, the season of love, the season of perversion, the season of hesitation, the season of carnival, the green fox, should it be called an autobiographical novel? It is a novel, the characters are close to the truth, ready to come out, seemingly worried that acquaintances will check in, and even more afraid that the readers will not know the drama. Who in the book is so and so in reality. Biography, should this be addressed directly? He just wanted to say it, he still wanted to say something, hiding deeply, playing the mummy, and injecting a large group of readers into the gloomy reed, and even betting: who can hook the things in the book to reality and reveal the answer, the author still has Awards too! Master? 
1	I gave this book to many friends, and when I gave it, I told them that the things in the book may be happening in every corner of the world. Especially in your company. In the family, Haha, many of my friends’ company conditions are just as in the book, with hidden dangers everywhere. Some 30-something friends said yes after reading it. Those in their 50s, after reading it, knowingly tell them that they have seen it through. Haha, the total number is pretty good. Take this question to read, you will find the answer you want 
0	It was not this one I wanted to book. When I was looking for a hotel, I saw that this hotel had feedback on every review. I thought the service was good, so I booked it. But for those of us who are driving and not familiar with Suzhou, this hotel is not easy to find. It took us more than an hour to make a few calls to find it. It was raining when it arrived, and the waiter took the initiative to pick up 2 umbrellas, which gave us a good first impression. After entering the room, I found that the room is amazingly small! I don’t even know if the wardrobe + bathroom + corridor has the 20 square meters mentioned on Ctrip. People who are still slim like me will encounter something when they turn around. You can imagine how small the room is. Although the room was quieter according to our requirements, but outside the window is the back door of the small restaurant on the food street. It is dirty and messy, and it is no wonder that my mother is unwilling to eat in that street. The TV is very small, with few channels, only a few. With Phoenix Satellite TV but no domestic cable, there is almost no choice. The furnishings and supplies of the rooms are indeed pretty good, so they are worth the price. But something unpleasant happened the next day. We went to the restaurant for breakfast at 8 o'clock. At that time, there were only 7-8 people including our family. There were not many kinds of breakfast, but 5 or 6 were empty, except for bread and steamed buns. Please add the waiter. There is no response. It takes a long time to add 1-2, and continue to maintain the situation where half of the varieties are not available. At first I thought it was too late for the kitchen, but later I saw the milk and orange juice poured out. I took it to the kitchen and only added 1/4 of the amount, which was only enough to pour 3-4 cups. I thought this hotel was a little bit silly, because at that time There are already more than 10 people dining, and the time is only half of the time they promised to serve! At the checkout, the aunt who checked the room told the reception desk that one of the towels in our room was dirty and could not be washed off. The towels in our room did fall on the floor and soiled when we took the children to Suzhou Park the day before. It was a little troublesome to wash, but it was by no means indestructible. I asked if I had already washed it and I was sure that I couldn't wash it off, and I said yes; I asked what to wash, and I said clean water. I really don't know whether to be angry or laugh! Asked the cleaning lady why she didn't use washing powder, she said frankly what the laundry room said, and said that the laundry room is not here, so there is no detergent! I really don't want to talk to such a less clear-headed person, and directly ask the supervisor to come out and get some kitchen detergent. She just chooses a dirty place, rubs it with detergent, and the original white color comes out. That’s it. The supervisor also said that there is a color difference from the normal white, and that it will be scrapped. He also said that the laundry room will have to add money, etc., to see that the time has been delayed for more than half an hour. The family is waiting and does not want to engage with them again. , That is, we bear the washing fee, and the supervisor actually offered a high price of 30 yuan, which is about the same as the price of towels in a 5-star hotel. Thinking of leaving, I didn't care about the price anymore. Who knows that the supervisor actually used the so-called magnanimous attitude to tell the general station that if you let them pay 30 yuan! It is really so exciting, and the good mood of the day is destroyed! It seems that the word cheap and good quality is useless now. 
1	"My attitude towards mathematics has always been tepid, neither I like nor hate it. As for the real thinking that arises from mathematics, it is something that I have never paid attention to. It is not surprising, because I have not obtained the interest and satisfaction that really touched me from studying mathematics. After reading ""How to Solve Problems"", in the author's calm, clear, and wise discussion, I thought a lot and made a lot of notes. I felt that the gains were not small. I dare to say so far. I am just new to mathematics. One point refers to the real understanding: mathematics is the dance of thinking, precision, elegance, and purity. "
1	"It is truly a very representative biography. With the narration of the author bit by bit, I can watch Soros’s life’s growth. For more than half a century, a legendary figure in the financial world. The great ups and downs of the people really teach us the correct outlook on life and values. Teach us how to perceive the complicated laws, how to face the sudden increase or fall of wealth, how to combine ideals and careers organically to create our own brilliant legend. ""Understand the chaos, and you may become rich."" --- ""Soros"" is wise and wise. "
1	After the suit is bought, basically other configurations don't need to be added, which is very cost-effective. 
0	The workmanship of ASUS needs to be improved, and the middle of the keyboard is slightly protruding, which does not affect the use. Nothing else was found temporarily. 
1	The hotel is cost-effective, the service attitude and room facilities are good, and the bedding is very clean~ the carpet is dirty and needs to be improved 
0	Very general. Work, such as people drinking water, knows the temperature. The advertisement is too high. Why should a newcomer with sound mind and good emotional intelligence waste time reading? Dealing with people and things will gradually be polished with the increase of work experience. It is really your turn. In that place, facing people and things like that, you will choose the action that is most beneficial to you, and you don't have to be taught. Don't like the love inside. The criticism is relatively simple, but it is indeed not recommended. 
1	Very old five-star. Objectively speaking, maybe once worthy of this title, but what you see now is really out of date. It is strongly recommended to renovate and replace with new facilities, but the service is still very good, when you know our After being dissatisfied, the manager took the initiative to upgrade our room...the service is good 
1	Brand new, authentic and licensed products, and the delivery staff are also very professional. The HP warranty information has been found online, and the price is not available in physical stores in Shanghai. It can be said that this is a mini laptop, not a netbook. Performance can be comparable to some notebooks. The best part is the six-cell battery, which can last for four hours when fully charged. I am very satisfied. 
0	1) Without a bag, I had to pack it in my big book bag when I went out; 2) The button elasticity is a bit small, and it is easy to press the wrong key when typing; 3) The vertical resolution of the screen is low, for some dialog boxes that are not adjustable Cannot be displayed completely. 
1	The hotel is a bit old, with average facilities and average breakfast. The location is near the railway station, but the surrounding environment is a bit messy. 
0	I'm sure I won't live here again, it's too old, the musty smell is too strong, it doesn't feel good! 
1	1. I started buying HP CQ45-307TX. I didn't expect a hardware failure, except for screen flashing and dead pixels! In order to exchange the goods, I ran several times, but in the end 307 was out of stock! I bought Lenovo ideapad Y430A-TSI and used it for a few days. 
0	I don't like it. The content of the book is very scattered, similar to the form of a blog. I write where I think about it. There is no systematic summary. There are many questions and answers between patients and doctors, which are not universal. Although some of the content and viewpoints are good for reference, overall I don't like this book very much. I plan to forward it to the elderly. Maybe she will like this book if she has time to study hard. 
0	I felt pretty good about this book, but I didn’t read a few pages before I found such a big problem. I jumped directly from page 14 to page 23. I said, it seems that the left and right pages don’t match up! I don't know who should I find to solve this problem? 
0	No XP driver is provided, so installation is troublesome. But you can find the driving wizard and the Z weapon. At the same time, many programs in the provided drive disk can also be used in XP. The LCD display screen is normal, it is best to change to LED. 
0	I have great expectations for this book, but I feel disappointed after reading it. It is just a collection of blog posts. The content has many repetitions, and the specific operability is not strong. It feels like the author was driven out to be famous. 
0	Disadvantages: The rooms are relatively old, and the elevator is really slow, like netizens. The so-called 2003 new renovation is actually a general cleaning. Internet speed is not fast. It is inconvenient to go out and play, and there is no place to eat and consume nearby, so I have to go out a lot. The surrounding environment is not good and the quality of personnel is poor. I saw a mineral water bottle flying upstairs and almost hit the head of the girl in front. Advantages: The breakfast is very good, and it is not far from the main business districts around. The waiter's attitude is acceptable. 
0	The battery standby time is short, the battery needs to be replaced; the notebook is too heavy to carry; the factory partition is too many, and the system has to be reinstalled 
1	I stayed in a business suite. The price of 650 is not high. I feel that the configuration of the room is not up to that level. The sofa in the hall is still a rattan chair. . . Maybe you want to highlight some tropical style? not feeling good. . . The lobby and internal environment of the hotel are OK, and the service of the staff is OK. If the price can be reduced by 50-100 yuan, it is more appropriate. . . . . . and also. . The road at the door was being repaired and I thought it was an earthquake along the way. . . sweat. . . . Psychological shadow PS, a little curious. . . The four words of Baiyun Mountain Villa were actually written by Chairman Mao? ! ! ! Want to know allusions. . . Hotel Feedback June 18, 2008: First of all, thank you for your valuable comments to the hotel. According to your preferences, we have set up a personalized file for you. Next time you come to check in, we will not arrange business suites with rattan chairs and sofas. The municipal construction at the door is only temporary, because our Xinchang is evaluating a civilized city. And our side is an exemplary street. I would like to express my humility for the inconvenience caused by this, and sincerely look forward to your visit again! The four characters of Baiyun Mountain Villa at the gate of the Villa are extracted from many mao styles, not by Chairman Mao himself. 
1	It was only 4 days after the shipment arrived in Chongqing. The machine has a perfect screen and surfing the Internet. The big screen is more comfortable than the 14's. It took about half a month for this value. The driver asked a friend to help install it. 
1	Han Lin is an excellent soldier, a very motivated and independent woman. Jiang Shian was born in poverty, but with his little efforts, he has made outstanding achievements in his career. During the first time they got together, Jiang Shian liked her very quietly, but Han Lin had no relative feelings for him, and the two passed by. A few years later, time has passed. Han Lin is still Jiang Shian’s favorite, and Han Lin can love him, but Jiang Shian can’t. The society, morality, and conscience have gone through a hard struggle... 
0	The service attitude of the hotel staff is not very polite, the room staying in is relatively simple, and the price of the room is expensive. 
0	1. The pre-installed VISTA system defaults to one partition. When you ask Lenovo, you can't change it. You can only compress another disk. Is that true? 2. The system runs a bit slow, is there too many pre-installed things? 3. The function key FN is at the bottom left corner. It is often pressed incorrectly, maybe it is not used to it. 
0	With the Tom series that I bought, this one has been stranded, it feels very messy, and there is no storyline. A 3-year-old 3-month-old boy does not plan to buy this series of books 
0	"Yu Dan's ""The Analects of Confucius"" is simply nonsense. Except for ""The Analects"", she was all right! Her speech was good for building a harmonious society, but it distorted the basic spirit of Confucius. This book is called ""Yu Dan's Experience"", which is more accurate. "
0	The weight is too heavy. There was a problem with the network connection tonight, and then it returned to normal. I don't know if this phenomenon will occur. 
0	The appearance is cumbersome, right? In addition, this model does not have a card reader, but there are two card slots for express and pcmcia cards. 
1	I read the preface first when I got it. It felt like my sister’s dependence on my sister. I eagerly continued to turn it over. Looking at the detailed exploded diagram and super wordy inside, everything is so simple and easy to understand, and rich in a special kind. The magnetism attracted me. It was not like previous books. I was eager to try almost the dishes in this book. So, I started my cooking journey... This book is not only a good textbook, but also A free space full of stories and emotions...For those who know how to cook or not, but are full of enthusiasm as a good guide, start everything with happiness and set off... 
0	This shop is too bad and the room has a musty smell, and the most unbearable thing is that the front desk work efficiency is extremely low! 
1	I arrived at this hotel on the second night of the second year. The environment of the hotel is very good. The back mountain is the tourist area, and the front is Wuyi Square. The room facilities are average, but the service is very warm, and there is fruit delivery. 
1	It's pretty, and black is a classic color that never falls behind. I wanted to wait for the white to arrive before buying, but it still couldn't match the black temptation. The appearance is small and generous, suitable for both boys and girls. 
0	The A side of the casing is a bit plastic, but it does not affect the appearance; the weight of the body is a little heavier, but the weight of ordinary computers is also the same; when installing XP, a blue screen appears, and the Internet says that you want to modify the BIOS, just use VISTA; At the beginning, the bluetooth driver could not be used, but later it worked; bare metal... 
1	The configuration is very high, worthy of the price, Vista is too bad, startup takes up too much system memory, you can only change XP, change XP to switch back to IDE mode, or use an integrated driver disk, HP official driver provides most , But it seems a little problem, the QuickLook function of the machine is actually a bit tasteless, and the overall workmanship is okay. 
0	The ASUS logo on the screen is very hot. I heard that it is because of the LCD backlight. I don’t know if it will affect the service life. 
0	Two JD cargo numbers are posted on the outside of the box, which seems to have been shipped once. The packaging is also dirty, unlike the new factory. Although there is no evidence to prove that this book is a second-hand product, I always feel uncomfortable. I hope that Jingdong will pay attention to all aspects of the future and not be shoddy. 
1	I read about Wang Xiaobo in my freshman year, starting from the Bronze Age, and then reading it one after another. I feel very familiar with the author, with the words, and with his life. I can't say that I read it too thoroughly, but it resonates in my heart. This time I got this set of books, and I felt a lot stranger. Read some words carefully. Wang Xiaobo probably wouldn't want others to read his novels like the classics. He always pays attention to the minority in society with compassion, but he can't get away from it, making people feel cute. The printing of this set of books is not very good, and the paper seems to isolate the reader from the author. The illustrations are acceptable. 
0	I have been to Yancheng many times. I stayed at Yanfu Hotel for the first time. I was really disappointed that the whole wall was black and dull. It seemed to be smoked. The furniture was very shabby. The breakfast was very poor. The fruit was only watermelon. The TV in the room was from the 90s. The price and the room are seriously disproportionate to the hotel. It is said that Jiang used to live in the last to find out that he was staying in the presidential suite. I am dizzy. If you are curious, you can live in it. 
0	"I booked the Huandao Underwater World Hotel in Sanya through Ctrip on February 9th and February 10th. Through this reservation, I finally opened my eyes and experienced the brilliant tricks of Sanya hotels. I originally booked a room of 400 yuan for 1,980 yuan a night. I drove a car from Haikou for almost four minutes to the hotel at 3:30 pm on the 9th, and the check-in procedures were completed until the room was almost four o’clock, but the room was not cleaned. , I waited for nearly an hour before I could enter the room to rest, and I was even more stunned when I entered the room. I read the online reviews when I made a reservation and they all wrote well. I think it was written by someone in this hotel to deceive others. , The room for one night away in 1980 was actually the same as a bed and breakfast. The toilet was black and smelly, and the sheets were yellow. Forget it, for the New Year. The next morning we went to the Chinese restaurant on time and planned to enjoy the Chinese breakfast that we spent 90 yuan (30 yuan per person). The result is stunned again, want to know the content of our breakfast? A small pot of white porridge, a small dish of unflavored mustard, three steamed buns, three vegetable meat wraps, and three sesame balls. In the end, we left without a bite. I believe this black shop will keep these breakfasts away. Use it for the next guest. Two days have passed, we are going to check out, and the most annoying thing has come. When we checked out, we had 20 yuan. We said that one of our rooms used two packs of cleaning fluid. In fact, we are useless. I I think even if it’s twenty yuan anyway, I’m sure to swallow my breath when going out. After the argument, when we were about to pay, a stinky woman in yellow with an abominable face came up and said that we ate and retreated. Room, you have to charge 400 yuan, (this hotel is only 400 yuan a night when it is not a holiday), I am so angry, knowing that I can’t compete with them at all. I think China is now a civilized society, so I should complain about it. In the end, I was still disappointed. I first called the tourist complaint hotline in Hainan Province. After a round of inquiries, the other party told us that it was not under their jurisdiction, and asked me to call Sanya for the complaint hotline. (I really don’t know this group of taxpayers What’s the responsibility of the bad guys who live with the money?), I called Sanya again, and it took almost half an hour to get through. I repeated what I said just now. The other party said that they would send someone to understand and deal with it immediately. After the break, my ideals were not too bad for this holiday. There were some people who presided over the fairness for us. As a result, we wanted to be beautiful. After waiting for two full minutes, no one had been there. (During this period we kept calling, just I couldn't get through anymore, maybe it was deliberately blocked the phone), but we still paid the 400 yuan to leave the hotel. It was already more than three o'clock in the afternoon and everyone hadn't eaten yet. This is the treatment I get in Sanya, a well-known tourist resort in the whole country. I invite all tourists who want to stay in this bad hotel to read my post-stay experience before making a decision, so as not to be ruined for a good vacation like us. Feedback from the hotel on March 11, 2008: Hello! Your stay during the Spring Festival is not satisfactory, I apologize to you! Secondly, there are a few points that need to be explained: 1. The room covers are white and light yellow; Except for the black marble countertop, the restrooms are all white. The restroom has self-expensive ""Bath Companion"" lotion, with a very obvious reminder-""paid use 10 yuan / bag"". 2. You said, ""You still have to pay the 400 yuan to leave the hotel."" In fact, you checked out at 12:18 noon on February 11, and the hotel did not charge your half-day rent. If you want to charge half-day rent, then It should be half of the full-day rent of 1960 yuan, or 980 yuan. The hotel attaches great importance to the opinions of guests, and expresses gratitude to the guests who put forward their opinions! Sincerely hope that every guest can give us valuable feedback to help us improve and enhance the quality of service. "
0	No broadband has become the biggest problem, and the absence of industrial and commercial banks nearby has become the second problem. Additional comments January 13, 2007: Nothing to eat for breakfast has become an inexcusable problem. 
1	The appearance is mostly IBM style, recessed display, good keyboard touch, red dots and so on. . . The whole has a matte feel, it feels very comfortable, and the design is reasonable in all aspects. Nice screen! 
1	The appearance is stylish, and it inherits ASUS's consistent advantages of good heat dissipation. The interface location is more reasonable than that of the X8 series. The best thing is that the sound effect is good, much better than the X81 bought in April. 
1	Learning is necessary and painful. Let learning become a happy thing, its value is extraordinary! This book gives you a panoramic knowledge of communication and a lot of humorous analogy explanations, allowing you to quickly understand the true connotation of a principle, and while gaining this knowledge, you also experience light-hearted humor. Chinese people always like to take knowledge seriously and solemnly, which discourages me and other ordinary people who love to learn. Thanks to the author of this book, I can take learning as an interesting pastime. I hope the author will publish more monographs on communication!

1	It turns out that it is a PP bag, which feels much better than ordinary plastic bags. This price can have a touch switch, a 16:9 LED screen, and a 105 512M graphics card. I think it is really good value! The system is also easy to install. Unlike HP, this BIOS has a hard disk mode option, which can be installed by changing it to IDE. Drivers are available online. 
0	Quite expensive, but very disappointed. The utilization rate is too low. Maybe my kids are also older. None of us have any interest in this book 
1	"His life is a painful life, and at the same time a life of erudition, suffering has allowed him to accumulate and make his artistic flowers more vivid and dazzling.

1	The surrounding environment of the hotel is good, the RT-Mart opposite is more convenient for shopping, the rooms are OK, the service is OK, and the overall price/performance ratio is not bad. 
0	The sound is small and the adapter is black. The linux+sata hard disk has tortured me to death. Winpe made a boot disk, deleted and re-partitioned deep xp-sp3 pm, and now it still does not recognize the hard disk and cannot install the system, who can help!

So staying again on 2/25 was upgraded to a luxury standard of 270 yuan, I did not expect... the room was actually smaller than the previous standard room, and the shower room was so small that I couldn’t turn around , Even the dressing table and wardrobe disappeared, and I responded to the front desk, how can it be worse than the previous room type~ The waiter responded not only with a bad attitude, but also the reason why the door lock of the room I stayed in the previous time was broken. ~ My girlfriend and I were annoyed, and we checked out at 5 o'clock in the morning the next day and moved to the Normandy Hotel on Central Street to stay in a suite. Although the room rate was more than 20 yuan, the room type was three times larger than this ""bad far"" Yes, Normandy Hotel is not only in a good location (if you hit D from Yuanda to Central Street, it will cost another 14 yuan~""~), the front desk service is better!... Think twice! "
1	At first, my mother thought this book was the same as the little bear's picture book, but after reading it carefully, she found that the child and her little friend imitate the adult to play the house every day! After telling the story to the 19-month-old baby, we will again He took his baby Qiaohu as his little friend, and learned that Apollin and Qiaohu played house games together. The children can play happily! I first told the children four stories, one is to see the doctor, the other is in the garden , One is driving a car, the other is shit, the baby is very happy to follow Apollin to learn to play imitating games with his partners. What a good book! 
0	The memory can be larger, it is best to configure 2G. . It is more difficult to add memory, remove the battery, and the fan is a little loud. 
1	The price-performance ratio is good, and the weight is lighter (lighter than expected); the display effect has been improved due to the use of a 14-inch 16:9 LED display, and the use of ACER's power-saving technology has improved battery life, imitating chocolate The keyboard is more comfortable to use. 
0	The price cut was too fast, the price was cut after 3 days of crazy buying, and there was a bright spot on the screen when the goods were taken 
0	I just switched from Jiuzhou Huanyu to this hotel, and I feel that the gap is too big. It is said to be in the city center, but there is nothing else around except Tianning Temple. The room is a bit old, old style, and the bath water is very small. The price is more than 30% higher than Jiuzhou Huanyu, which is very, very worthless. Will never choose here again unless the price drops below 200. 
1	Tinkpad’s books are still good. Although they have been streamlined a lot for cost reasons, they are still ok in terms of appearance and speed. The price is high. 
1	"I am a loyal reader of Ya Ya, and when she publishes a new book, I will inevitably buy it for collection. This book and ""Study Abroad without Love"" is a portrayal of the life of international students at different stages. I have never studied abroad, but I am still moved by that simple emotion. Moved by Yaya, she can always express the voice of her peers in words. So I think it's hard to find, I will always support Yaya "
1	This is a great man, and one can definitely use this word to describe him: Gregg Mortensen I think he is fully qualified to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Ordinary, he is doing extraordinary things, and ten years of persistence, it is hard not to be moved by his persistence. He let us know another shining point of humanity! Sincerely, the first cup of tea, you are a stranger; the second cup of tea, you are our friend; the third cup of tea, you are my family, I will use my life to protect you. In this moving world of friendship, bursts of tea are scented, and the fragrance strikes people 
1	"After reading the whole article of ""Why"", there is no feeling of procrastination or loss of knots at all, it is very coherent and not sloppy. The words seem to have a fragrance and strength, attracting me, and pulling you step by step. I don't want to skip any paragraphs at all. No text is going to be. I really like it. I like He Yichen and Zhao Mosheng, the same affectionate. I remember very deeply--①If that person ever appeared in the world, everyone else would become a general. He said, I don't want to leave. ②Quiet, it is the farewell music, silence is Cambridge tonight. I like it very much, it's worth reading "
0	The hotel can only be described in a few words. It is dirty, messy and bad. In the middle of the night there will be a massage lady harassing you, making you a bad rest! If you protest, the lady will tell you this is their agreement! Don't know what agreement? 
0	First of all, the common problem with this picture book is that it is expensive. A few sheets of paper cost tens of yuan a copy. Second, although adults can understand the mother’s love in this book, children may not understand. Third, the drawing style is that of foreign children, and Chinese children are not so crazy. Fourth, the book is excessively flattered. Make people feel fooled 
0	The heat generation is large, the touchpad is a little hot, and the bottom of the screen is also hotter, compared with other notebooks. 
1	The appearance and the feeling of use are good. In fact, after I streamlined VISTA, I found that it is actually no different from XP. I had to change the system and it was troublesome. Now it is very comfortable to use the original system! 
1	The facilities of this hotel are really good. The location is also convenient and the lobby is stylish. Since there is no room type that I booked, the hotel was upgraded to a superior room when I arrived at the front desk. Overall, I am very satisfied. 
1	Yan Hong's name can be said to be a brand guarantee. Yan Hong is a writer in a feminine context, and her book is especially appealing to female readers. So watching her analyze the female psychology, it is indescribably warm and close. Even sarcasm and criticism of men can make people feel that it is a judgment from the female world, and only women can look at men from this perspective. Therefore, in the article, her sarcasm towards the men around Qin Huai Bayan, the so-called talented scholars, is merciless. After reading it, she humiliates men and makes women happy. 
0	The hotel is far away from the city, which is very inconvenient. Except for the grand lobby, the room is not five-star at all, and four-star at best. What's more inexplicable is that there is no heating and air conditioning in the room, so I will never consider staying next time. 
0	The memory is small, so you can only add it yourself. The keyboard feel is not as good as the legendary IBM. Maybe it is the habit of using Dell, but my colleague tried my keyboard with X61 and it was different. Overall, it's better to be comfortable. If you play 3D, it’s better to show it alone, after all, integration won’t work. 
0	The facilities are very poor, the smell is unpleasant, the sanitation is bad, and the worst is that there are erotic calls to the customer service to ask if you need massage services? But as soon as I heard that it was a female passenger, I hung up the phone, which made people feel that the so-called massage was abnormal. I really can’t figure out how CTRIP would promote such a hotel. It really makes people think that either the hotel deceived CTRIP’s inspection team, or CTRIP was not responsible. After so many years, the trust in CTRIP disappeared. The promotion of “shop” prevents more members from being deceived! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Additional comments July 17, 2008: I just received an apology call from the hotel executives, with a very sincere attitude and repeated promises to standardize service quality and improve software and hardware levels. I sincerely hope that they will do what they say and will build Fukai into a veritable four-star hotel when the nation celebrates the Olympics, so that domestic and foreign tourists will return with happiness and satisfaction. 
0	I saw it in a bookstore before. It was about the size of A4 paper, but when I got it, it was only half the size, and I didn't feel that way at all. The baby doesn't like it. 
0	There is a musty smell in the special room, and the facade is not as beautiful as Ctrip. 
1	The room is newly decorated, using light colors, it feels very warm, the layout is reasonable, and it is more spacious. The linen used in the hotel is very particular, and it feels thick and soft in the hand. The service is good, especially when I am on business. There are more clothes to bring, and the waiter can consider the actual needs of the guests, and add hangers at any time. The hotel’s meals are unique and have been to different floors, and they are all satisfied. Although the hotel is superior in details, but If you improve it in some places, it can be comparable to the local four- or five-star hotels. For example, the bathroom can be hung with a small hook. 
1	I wanted to change to XP, but I didn't want to be genuine. I added a Samsung DDR3 1G note. It was much faster to run VISTA, modify the system files, and the sidebar functions were complete, and it worked well. Let’s not talk about online word processing. The integrated sound card has a lower quality than the previous R61, the volume is enough, and the graphics card is slightly insufficient, but the low configuration can achieve this effect. I am quite satisfied with the heat dissipation and it is also very quiet. 
0	I bought this book in Dangdang at the end of 2008. I read it during the Spring Festival and found that the phenomenon of missing pages was very serious. Severely condemn Dangdang! Strongly demand a claim! 
1	The rooms of the Horizon Club are quite different from the ordinary guest rooms. The ordinary guest rooms are quite outdated. It is often heard that foreign guests experience free upgrades to the room, but the Chinese have never encountered it! 
1	I chose hp between asus and hp. Although I was not satisfied with the appearance, I wanted to exchange it, but this product is better than the configuration, so I can use it at home after listening to my husband. After two days, the performance is still very good, but the heat dissipation is not particularly good. The system is installed by people in the company, it is easy to use:) 
0	Absolutely rubbish book, ``It is worthless to read this book if you want to read history,'' Similar rubbish novels, It is not recommended for people who want to understand the history of the Ming Dynasty to read this book. of 
1	The room is very good, it is in the remote Kowloon City, so the room is much bigger than the downtown area. If you are not in a hurry, I recommend this hotel. It is to consider that the minibus fare of HK$12 will be increased every day. 
1	The appearance is stylish and the performance is OK. I have been posting here a few days ago, and I can send them all. There is no time for evaluation. Now it is OK. For personal reasons, I need to transfer this machine with Jingdong’s warehouse receipt and Invoice, I received the goods on the 24th of this month and transferred it at a price of 2500 yuan. I bought it at 2799 yuan. If you want, please add QQ: 63410093. If you are a friend in Guangzhou, you can meet and trade! (If you are not honest, thank you!) Please do not delete it, and give everyone a chance. Hello, everyone is really good! 
0	The order placed before, arrived today. Seeing that the price has dropped by 200 yuan, I can only admit that it is bad luck. In addition, the partition is indeed a bit deformed. Lenovo can do a survey, it is estimated that 80% of users want to prepare the partition in advance, of course it is not such a perverted partition, hehe. 
1	HPmini110mi is coming out soon, the price reduction is right, but we only enjoyed MAC LEOPARD a few days in advance　10.5 
1	Very well-behaved, light and thin, and meticulous workmanship. I bought it at 2099 yuan, which did not catch up with the good day of the special price of 1999 yuan, but my colleagues still feel that the price is good. I bought it and helped my colleagues reinstall the XP system and divided the districts. 
0	Every time I turn on the speaker, there is noise, and I have to shut down and restart it. Now it is not more than 7 days, but Jingdong is out of stock and can’t be replaced. Pain~~~~ 
0	When I received this set of books, I paid for it without opening it. Then I folded it and saw that the set of books was not complete. I ordered a new book, but all the new books have arrived on Monday, and today I have returned the book on Thursday but have not arrived yet. The cancellation and ordering are processed on the same day, which is really incomprehensible! 
0	I couldn’t swipe my card at the checkout. In order to catch the plane, I had to promise them to cancel the pre-authorization and check out after I left. After two days back, the hotel didn’t contact the hotel. Yesterday I called and said it was not done. Have to wait Monday 
1	"Another master female writer of crime mystery besides Agatha! The difference between female writers and male writers is that they are good at not only logically rigorous and tense criminal reasoning, but also the delicate observation and rich details of the weakness and complexity of human nature and the degradable or unbearable relationship between them. The novel also shows how women firmly maintain justice, care for family and love, surrounded by various physical and psychological pressures, interpersonal pressures, and regulatory pressures of the ""forensic"" profession. "
1	The hotel is very clean, the waiter would recommend me to the lady's non-smoking floor, the facilities are better, and the small snacks in the restaurant are also good. After learning from the previous experience that the hotel was not good at parking, I was quite satisfied during the three days. 
1	"Before reading this set of books, I bought a complete set of ""Different Carmela"" from Dangdang. At that time, my daughter was less than three years old and liked it very much. Later, when I saw this set, I was somewhat hesitant, because from the picture. Some are too simplistic. I bought a set with the feeling of trying it out. As a result, my daughter liked it as soon as I saw it. The characteristics of this set of books are quite distinct. The theme of each book has a great influence on shaping the good personality of the child. To help, my daughter learned love, self-confidence, and bravery from Frog. . . Thanks Frog! Thanks Dangdang! "
0	The print quality of the book is good, but the content is not applicable to me, like an educational manual. Anyway, it is not practical. Moreover, it is said that it is free shipping during the reading festival, not free at all. con man. 
1	"There is a hobby for a favorite book, and you must finish reading it as soon as you get it. This book is no exception. I didn't want to comment on the book I bought before, because there is no emotion to urge you to do so, but now I want to write about how I feel about it. The cover is very attractive to me. It feels like a cooling agent for hot summer days, it feels refreshing. Everyone has their own ""Ferris wheel"" in their hearts, which is a place she will never reach, and the monologues that begin paragraph by paragraph. Whenever I look up at the sky and the Ferris wheel, I will say to myself: Paris is waiting for you! Recommend to everyone you will love it! "
0	Why hasn't my book been received yet? Isn't it not posted. Shipment is displayed on the 12th! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
0	It's an extraordinary difference. Samsung doesn't know how to evaluate it. It is said that the level of facilities is not as good as the county-level guest house. The room is very narrow, the bathroom is just a toilet, and there is no table for storing items. The floor drain is easy to block, and the water fills Jinshan after 5 minutes of washing. In short, the equipment is too old, I suggest you don't be fooled. 
0	The driver of the wireless network card in the driver disk is wrong, you need to download the 8187 driver yourself. The fever is relatively large. 
0	It is a pity that this notebook is the first one that lacks a hard drive indicator light since I used it. It is very inconvenient. If the computer crashes when installing large software, it may not be known when 
1	The room is too old, the service is average, but the sauna is super big, as if it is a foreign business. The location is ok, but there is no other feeling. 
1	Because I like Zhang Ailing and own two complete works of Zhang Ailing, how can I not buy a new book? ? And Dangdang is still so affordable, love here seems to advertise this book and Dangdang. But you have to be unfamiliar with Zhang Ailing or dislike his writing. I advise you not to buy it, because this book follows Zhang's style and is a bit obscure and requires you to read it carefully. People who don't like Zhang will not be able to read it. It is commendable that the cover design of the publisher is really good, I personally like it very much. The binding is also very elegant. In short, I think it's great value~! 
0	I feel that the workmanship is average when I get it. The upper cover and keyboard are a little bulging, and it is very soft when pressed by hand. I feel that the materials are too poor. Not as solid as IBM. The pre-installed vista system is too bad and it is easy to crash. Changed to xp, the keyboard does not respond to the first time the shortcut driver is installed, and it needs to be installed twice. 
1	After buying this book, I feel that it not only guides the work in the sales position, but also provides good communication and enlightenment for people in ordinary functional departments. Among them, the five abilities of sales, the ten steps to a perfect deal, the ten most commonly used excuses for customers, the ten resistance points of customers easily, and the three beliefs of the master dealer^...... and so on, all are life contacts The most important chapter of the process. Training for employees is also very good, you can refer to it, or buy it as a prize for those employees who have outstanding performance in sales skills improvement training. 
1	After the book was received, the colleagues in the office took a fancy to it and found it very fun. The storyline was very interesting. Although there was no word, it made people love it. The book was originally intended to be given to my nephew who was under three years old, but before it was given out, not only did my colleagues read it, but people in my thirties also read it with gusto. My eight-year-old son also read it and pulled it. Classmates tell them. When the book arrived in the little nephew's hands, he took the adults to the fascinating request and talked about it. Hey! A good book! 
1	A 2G kingmax memory (not dedicated to ThinkPad) was added separately, and the performance is stable. It has been used for almost a month without any problems 
1	"When I first read this book, I saw that the author's experience was different from that of ordinary people, and the rebellious thoughts in my own bones gradually came to my heart. After I bought it and read it, I gradually integrated it into the book, sweeping away my original thoughts. This is not a book that only introduces life experiences, but a book that shows a person's psychological journey. Some unexpected experiences will take your heart to another faraway place. Slowly, slowly, everyone became the protagonist of ""Xiang Talan"", leaving an eternal longing and yearning in his heart. "
1	Not bad, it would be nice to be able to provide a double bed room with lake view, because the hotel has this type of room, I don’t know why Ctrip does not provide it! 
1	The decoration is good and all new. The service is very good and attentive. In Baoding, the service of the Bank of China left me the deepest impression. Then the breakfast is a buffet, with many varieties and good quality. The transportation around the hotel is also very convenient. The Baoding Municipal Government is opposite the hotel. 
0	The heat dissipation of the equipment is not very good. It’s the weather in May. The CPU is 58 degrees and the GPU is 60 degrees. It is best to use the heat dissipation base to work in the summer. 
0	I live on the 6th floor, and the sound of the KTV on the 3rd floor is very noisy! Even if I call the lobby to complain and hang up the phone... I will definitely not stay at this hotel in the future 
0	The price ratio of the hotel is broken, the rooms are relatively old, and there are melon seed shells left by previous guests on the carpet. How does the waiter clean the room? The towel smells of smoke and the soundproofing is poor. I can hear the TV next door and people outside the door. The toilet is also a bit dirty, and the non-slip carpet not only pierces people's feet, but also has mold. Said it is a 3-star hotel, I think it is only 2 stars at most, but the location is okay, it is in a prosperous area, but Yangzhou is also small, and it’s almost the same everywhere. Because I brought my daughter out to play, I added an extra bed. If Hanting and Motel couldn't add an extra bed, they wouldn't live here. Anyway, it was so-so, which was not satisfactory. 
0	"This is the worst book I have seen in this year. I read it in less than 2 hours (I really don’t want to waste too much time on this book). Unfortunately, I didn’t get any content. The only thing the scholar mentioned is useful is to tell the rich to learn from Western rich men and know how to give back to society. What is fairness? In this book is the answer to all questions. It is a panacea solution. This is trapped in the ""circular argument"" of traditional Chinese culture. If fairness is the solution to the problem, then we should also discuss in depth how to construct fairness. If it is guaranteed, it is a topic of sociological concern and a topic of management discussion. Fairness cannot be explained by the word. If the author himself should be a very powerful person, he can know that by knowing his many years of experience, he is amazing. But this book is really very general, and the hype is very suspect. There are hundreds of comments on this book in Dangdang, and I feel that quite a few of them are false. In addition, the price of this book is rather high. For such a small book, it costs 33 yuan, not a bit expensive, but very expensive. It is recommended not to buy. "
0	I dare not say that this book is not well written, but this is really an uncomfortable book. I don’t know whether the life of a real counselor is experiencing these uncomfortable things every day, and the heroine’s The life experience is also very quirky and lacks authenticity. I read Dr. Bi’s prose very early, and I have read a few novels, but this book is one that I don’t like very much, and some of my friends who love books also feel the same after reading it. 
1	I have read this book 5 times in a row. Every time, I read the end and start from the beginning. The content of the book is about to be memorized, but the mood is still as sad as when I first read it, and a little moved. It may be that there is less and less true love in the world, which will make you more and more comfortable in the book, or it may be paralysis. Suddenly I felt that Huang Ruyue was actually a bit pitiful. Although she finally got true love, she had waited for thousands of years. Probably no one can bear this kind of pain. I often fall into my own fantasy. If I were her, what would happen to me? What will happen? 
0	First time staying in such a terrible three-star hotel, worse than guest house. 1. Quite dirty, the carpet is old and dark, the sheets have not been changed, and the pillow has a large yellow stain. 2. Hot water from the faucet takes 10 minutes. The temperature of the hot water is only about 40 degrees. Most of the porcelain in the bathtub is taken off, and it is impossible to take a bath. 3. Every time you enter the room, you must hook up the power fuse from behind Yigui to be able to power on. 4. There are still cigarette butts left by the last guest in the toilet. Maybe it's on... last time left by the guest. 5. The service attitude is extremely poor, so I actually let me repair the power supply by myself. Sixth, the bed spring has broken, and I am extremely uncomfortable sleeping. Seven, when I went to the front desk to open the statement, the lady at the front desk actually said that the bill cannot be issued without my check-in information. gosh! ! ! Anyway, next time I come to Bengbu, I will not stay in this hotel even on Sleep Street! ! ! 
0	"I bought the first six volumes of ""Different Carmela"" for my son, and read with him in the bed every night before going to bed. We both liked it. I like the playful pictures in the book and the author's rich imagination. Later, as soon as the seventh book ""I Want to Find Lang Lang"" was released, I hurriedly bought it and shared it with my son. We are eagerly looking forward to the eighth, ninth and tenth volumes of ""A Different Carmela""... Because we like the various and imaginative stories that Carmela, Piccolo, Carmelo and Carmen bring to us. "
0	I heard that it was good, so I bought it, but my son didn’t like it at all, and I didn’t like it very much, haha 
1	The appearance is tough and atmospheric, with a strong business atmosphere, suitable for men, the configuration is definitely sufficient, the workmanship is excellent, the heat dissipation is good, the keyboard is super cool, and it is worth buying. 
1	Stir-fry emphasizes the color, flavor and taste, and it is indispensable. The quality of the book is also very good, and the pictures are very beautiful. Under this premise, reading a first recipe feels that the scope of the content is very wide, cold and hot dishes are small. There are everything for making soup. Most of the ingredients are common. The cooking process is very detailed and easy to operate. Both novices and veterans can read it. And nowadays, when more and more attention is paid to healthy eating, a series of health-care dishes are indeed a good choice. Stir-fried dishes are sometimes in a state of mind. Not bad! 
0	Although the theory in the book is good, it is too theoretical. I thought the book would arrange some content suitable for reading aloud, but it just listed a lot of what you want to do. I was disappointed! 
1	I wanted to choose T450A before because I think Core Duo might be better. But in the end I chose this Pentium. It's fast and it's not very hot. And it's really cheap. The keyboard is very comfortable. 
0	In July, our customers stayed for a total of six nights. There were three nights where the room was smelly. The guest was Italian. Due to the language barrier, there was no way to complain. After that, we informed our staff and replaced it. But the next day The hotel was partially decorated. There was no water supply at around 8:00 in the morning. The guests were shaving and washing their faces. It made our company very embarrassed. The shop started to only verbally apologize. The guests expressed their dissatisfaction. Later, our company strongly requested, All rooms (a total of 6) are promised to our member price (actually, each room is a discount of ￥50.00). Who knew that the three room discounts were only given to the final checkout. I was so disappointed with the approach of this hotel. Five stars! The dissatisfaction between the five-star and the pleasant, I wonder if we can draw an equal sign! ! 
0	I looked at it a little bit, and I started to take it seriously. The more I look at it, the more I think it may be more suitable for married people to read~~~~ Alas, put it aside, I need to read it later... 
0	As soon as I opened the book, I couldn’t let it go. I read it in one day. I thought it would be helpful to my job search if I read this book some years ago 
0	The heat dissipation needs to be improved. The sound of the CD-ROM drive is too loud, sometimes it looks like a tractor, but overall it is OK 
1	It's too far away. Going to Hong Kong is just to meet your shopping needs. It is not convenient to stay in the hotel and go out. The hotel is on the edge of Tuen Mun, New Territories. It costs $25 to take a taxi to Tuen Mun Center. There are no shopping malls and restaurants nearby. I will not choose it next time. Advantages: The facilities are okay, if you spend a day or two on your honeymoon. 
1	The location is very good, just upstairs of DFS, it closes later than other specialty stores in the evening, so you can enjoy shopping at last. It is also very close to Harbour City, 2-3 minutes walk. The hotel facilities and services are very good. There are multi-purpose adapters in the room. Almost any plug can be switched. It is really convenient to forget to buy one when you go. You can use it in any country in the future. The service staff is very kind. The room is not too big, the distance between the two beds is only one seam, but other hardware facilities are good, with LCD TV, the bathroom is a bit like the Sanya Sheraton Hotel, but the bathroom has a window to this room, you can take a bath While watching TV in the room. Newly renovated room. Support, live next time. 
1	"I was shocked to see these pictures of water crystals. We have to admit that we have little knowledge of the world. The author gave a hypothesis, a beautiful wish with love and gratitude as the theme. Perhaps it is because it deviates from our childhood materialistic education, I feel confused. However, in recent years, more and more theoretical interpretations of so-called ""quantum mechanics"" have indeed shaken and subverted our scientific view. Regardless of right or wrong, facing these realities is the initial choice of all wise men. I would rather believe that, at least, there will be many good feelings in my heart. "
1	I am not familiar with the name Ge Cuilin, but the story of Wild Grape is still fresh in my memory. Memories of childhood. There are rare Chinese fairy tales (excluding myths and folk tales) that have been remembered for so long. Nowadays, our generation who are mothers often read the works of familiar foreign children's books such as Pippi Longstocking, short nose, magic chair, invisible chick and so on. It's not that there are too few children's literature in China. I subscribed to children’s literature and juvenile literature for several years when I was young, but most of the works I can remember today are foreign works. However, wild grapes are remembered. 
0	The content is rich, very suitable for parent-child reading, the color pictures are appropriate and vivid, my son and I read it again, and my son will remember the wonderful stories inside 
1	In her eyes, this is the best gift I have ever given her. It is estimated that she will remember it as an adult! ! ! I have given her various designer dresses and toys before, but none of them make her like so much. It seems that to make her happy in the future, just send her good-looking books. Think about it when I was a child, I also liked reading books, and I really got to the point of forgetting to sleep and eat. When I was in kindergarten, I had more than 100 small books, and I would read them again and again whenever I had time. Haha, this is really a good habit! 
1	ThinkPad is my first choice brand, with reliable quality, superior performance, user-friendly after-sales service, and all aspects are satisfied! 
0	We all know that many things don’t need to be so cumbersome. It seems to be promoting yourself to clear yourself of suspicion of public opinion. I don’t think it’s really a success. Many content in the book. It is estimated that this book was planned and definitely not completely completed by the author. Some of the content is still very fake. This kind of publicity is really too much. It is not recommended to buy it. It is boring. 
0	Except for the location close to Wangfujing, the others are really not complimented. When I checked in, I found that there was half a glass of water in the teacup and notified the waiter to replace it. I was surprised to find that the waiter poured the water in the cup into the bathroom and then washed it and put it back in place. She asked her if the cup was not disinfected. go with. 
1	Teachers in kindergarten should watch it more. Children are still in kindergarten most of the time. Some things experienced in kindergarten may affect the character and even life of the child. If preschool education can comprehend Montessori's parenting method, let the child really make the decision. Really love children. I have great patience with children. I believe that our young seedlings can grow into towering trees; our pillars of tomorrow will make China stronger. 
1	"""Little Mouse Who Wants to Eat Apples"" is a children's book from Japan. The overall style is fresh and elegant, with a lot of blank space. Except for those apples that are red, the others are black and white. The characters are very vivid and vivid. vivid. My daughter Kuan Kuan likes this book. When it comes to ""a little bird came, and an apple was taken away"", before the picture turned to the picture, Kuan Kuan waved her little hand and learned how to fan it. wing. It is more suitable for children over one year old to read. "
1	Quite a beautiful book, what attracted me at first was the comments and recommendations of many people. I spent all night watching it all in one go. I like Tan Bin, Cheng Ruimin, and the love between them. I am just a student at school, and I will step into the workplace to find a place when I graduate in the future. Some of the details make me envious. I also hope to be as capable, elegant, intellectual and generous like Tan Bin. Even if a little arrogant, it is a proud rose. Because of this book, I became obsessed with workplace novels. 
0	The SATA hard disk drive is too tossing. XP2 and XP3 will not work. In the end, I had to make a system disk with SATA drive according to their requirements. 
0	It is the worst hotel I have booked through Ctrip. Check in on July 18th, it was 300 yuan/day, I think it was worth 80 yuan at most. 1. The walls of the room are mottled; 2. The facilities are outdated; 3. The bathroom is too small and looks very unclean; 4. The price is expensive; 5. Even a credit card guarantee is required. I don't know if it is a Ctrip or a hotel; 6. The front desk The attitude is not bad. To the north of Qinfa Hotel, there is a newspaper business hotel with reasonable prices and clean facilities. There is Haiyue Business Hotel further north, but unfortunately it was newly renovated and the taste is too big. 
0	The whole article is superficial and tacky little examples, and elementary school students can write these! Comparing Yu Dan with Yi Zhongtian, it simply ruined Professor Yi! Do not buy this book, I regret it for a lifetime! I read it again and treat it as Waste paper is sold! It is too low level, junior high school students will look down on it! 
0	It’s really hard for the author to be able to write English like this. Although it’s a bit funny, it’s a pity that I don’t like this style. Moreover, the mixed reading of Chinese and English can remember some vocabulary, but it ruins the reading ability. 
0	The plastic and metal pieces of the battery socket were deformed during the self-lifting (outsourcing is intact). It is estimated that this is the case at the factory. Show the staff to look for customer service, adjust it by yourself, and use it. But there are small black dots on the touchpad 
1	The facilities are outdated and I don't feel like it was renovated in 2005. The bathroom is also more general. But this is the case for Samsung. The bed is too short, I'm not very tall. Lie down a little, but my feet hang out of the bed. The bedside table has a small radio which is very distinctive, the business room has a computer, and the internet speed is also very good. I live in a corner room and I feel that the noise is not too loud. 
1	The most valuable thing is the support, the thing behind the pressure. And the definition of trends. As for the latter wave theory and Gann theory. These things are not the actual combat skills of masters, but the works of stock market losers. Not only is it meaningless, it is harmful! But overall the book is good. After a complete bull and bear market, I feel that the most important thing to learn to trade in stocks is to read books written by long-time stock market winners. Books summarized by others are rubbish. Not only are they not good, they are harmful! 
0	The heat dissipation problem is always a bit prominent, high configuration and high power consumption will inevitably increase the temperature. In addition, the workmanship of the housing needs to be further strengthened 
1	I ran through various bookstores in Changsha, but I still couldn’t buy this dictionary (it was recommended by my tutor during the research, but I never bought it). Fortunately, Dangdang.com gave me the dictionary so soon. , I feel it in my hand. I compared some English-Chinese dictionaries I bought before and found that it is indeed unusual. The entries are much richer and the annotations are also very detailed. The only thing to say is that if the entries can be marked in color, It's not all dark, the eyes will feel a lot better, after all, the font is too small, adding a little color will make it softer :) 
1	The configuration is more value-for-money, the heat generation is smaller than the Lenovo E390 I used (CPU standby 40 degrees, maximum 71 degrees; GPU 45 degrees, maximum 70 degrees), the fan sound is not loud, and it does not often run at high speed, 3dmark06: 27XX points, in I haven't seen it in a machine within 4K, and the 1080P playback is basically smooth when connected to the TV (the hardware solution cpu occupancy rate does not exceed 40%). The workmanship is not exquisite, but there are still no defects found. The operating system is installed smoothly, and there is a full set of XP and VISTA drivers in the accompanying DVD. 
0	The service attitude was very bad, except for the free water, a bottle of Yiyun received 60. It was too dark. What kind of foreign-funded enterprise meeting was held that day, it was all about the old Chinese watches and the ghost foreign-funded enterprises. Really annoying! 
0	The memory is only 1G, it’s a bit small, so I bought a 2G KST667 and installed it on the motherboard is a SIS chipset 
1	The workmanship is good and the shell is also very beautiful. It's ok after a test! ~ Zhongtong is very fast. The order on the 13th afternoon was received this morning. 
0	system! System! I received the goods at noon and asked a colleague to install it. I didn’t install it. I went to the after-sales service and said that I had to bring a genuine system disk. Yes, brother, I couldn’t install it, but I went to Suning Appliance. , Ah, helpless, come to Pacific Digital to pay for someone to install it tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, what trouble 
1	I live in a big bed room, which is similar to the situation introduced by the previous package. I will upgrade the room for free, and I will get two free bottles of Coke. The overall evaluation of the hotel’s service is just as satisfactory. However, it is a bit too much to rate five stars. Four stars almost. Of course, in terms of cost performance, it is not bad, after all, the price is not the standard five-star price. If you have an opinion on the store, it is a bit old. Although I can see that it took some time to renovate, I still don't like it enough. In addition, the breakfast is basically satisfactory, the variety is okay, and the taste is so so. The software is okay. If you want the map to have a free map to send to your door, the straw shoe support is a bit trivial, and the basic skills are still in place. 
1	Overall, it is relatively clean, and the location is very good, the downtown area is very convenient. 
1	After reading the complete book, I feel a sense of reality in the face of war and how cruel the regime is. Is it possible to endlessly rush human lives in order to consolidate my authority? The death of Milong is completely a victim of a typical Chinese regime, and the death of death is so helpless and sad. 
0	There is no outsourcing, no mouse, and the adapter is hot when charging. It is normal when charging. I'm a little scared. The office trial version is not found. Is it the XP version? 
0	1. The seam of the shell on the right palm rest is not tight; after looking at it, it seems that the foot base below is a bit lower than the others. All except this uncomfortable 
1	It is really convenient to have a drive after partitioning the hard disk. Before installing the drive, it took a long time to download it. This time done quickly 
1	Stayed here on May 1st, as a three-star hardware. The front desk manager praised it. Our party was eating next door and the invoice won the prize, but the restaurant just refused to redeem it for us, and the attitude was very unreasonable. We talked about the matter with the hotel, the front desk manager Zhang Ying said to help us handle it, and mailed us back to Beijing. Although the money has not been received yet, we are very happy. After all, this kind of professional sense of responsibility and service is in the land of China. It is worth promoting. 
1	The rooms are generally good, and the breakfast is average for a four-star hotel. There are few snacks outside the hotel or in general hotels. In general, it's not bad for people on business trips like me 
0	Standard double room, small area. Broadband is 20 yuan per day (other chain stores are generally free). There are only thin sheets on the mattress, which makes it feel very dirty. The waiters are generally very old, and the old churros service is poor. Walking. It takes about 5 minutes to Century Park Station. If you visit the Shanghai New Exhibition Center and stay in the store, the price-performance ratio is just passing. 
1	Convenient transportation, good food in the restaurant, but small, make reservations when you are busy. The price is reasonable, stay here next time! Additional comments April 11, 2008: The domestic card cannot be swiped when swiping, but the foreign card is swiped out. strange! 
1	It's pretty good, the room is very bright, not depressed, looks very clean, but the bath place is a bit small, but the water is large. 
1	I bought it for a friend, 1 is cheap, 2, and it looks pretty. Although it is 14 inches, the design is very delicate and very thin. I don't want to look bulky like before. There is a heat vent under the cpu, the cpu heat dissipation is very good, but the heat dissipation of the hard disk is poor, the hard disk of the whole machine is the hottest. Now my friend is win7 and xp dual system, it is very fast, this configuration is worth the price 
0	I stayed in room 802 on the 16th, and there was rumbling noise throughout the night, like an elevator, but also like moving furniture upstairs for physical exercise. It was not obvious when I sat up, and when my head hit the pillow, it looked like I was resting on the stereo. I didn't sleep well all night. I originally planned to run away for 3 days the next morning. Hotel Feedback January 22, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable comments. Please forgive me for the inconvenience caused by the hotel’s emergency repairs that night. If you have any questions about the room, please call the front desk of the hotel. The front desk of the hotel will serve guests wholeheartedly. You are welcome to stay at Zhongnan Seaside Hotel again and give your valuable suggestions. 
1	After taking this set of books back to the child, the baby was very interested and finished 13 books in one night, which was not enough. I especially like the baby to go to the zoo, because this is very close to life. We often take the baby to the zoo. The scenes in it make the baby feel very familiar and especially interesting. Other things that enter the baby for Christmas are far from our lives, and the baby will also let me talk about it, but she will pick some of the pages to look at. Overall, this book is good. Note that the age of the child is 1 year and 9 months. 
1	The hotel in Luoyang is still good, the restaurant is also OK, and the service is good. 
1	In Ningxia, this hotel should be considered a good hotel. 
0	The interfaces are too scattered, both front and rear. The heat dissipation at the bottom right bottom is not very good, and the interface of the docking station is not covered by a cover. 
0	There is no hot water in the bath! ! Too depressed~~ I have to climb the mountain the next day! ! But the internet speed is ok~ 
0	The touchpad heats up very quickly, and the heat dissipation is good in other places. The USB port of the mouse is indeed a bit inhuman. The camera QQ is very clear, but I don’t know how to open it if I don’t open QQ. 
0	There are too few usb ports, and they are all on the left. The keyboard is very hot after a long time, but it runs stably. After installing the ghost system, it will crash, and you need to download the network card driver from the official website. The memory is only 1g. The xp driver on the official website is so bad that the camera has not been installed until now. 
0	The LED screen is not beautiful enough, the contrast is insufficient, the Multi-touch touchpad is not easy to use, easy to misuse, it is not as good as the ordinary touchpad, the A side is easy to stick fingerprints, the bottom back cover is not easy to remove, and you must be careful when replacing the memory 
1	It has beautiful appearance and excellent performance. It can run high-definition videos and current mainstream games smoothly. In the same size model, weight and heat are better controlled. 
0	This book is not very useful to tell the truth, and what it says does not make me feel like I have learned anything. It's just that some of the wrong places in daily life can be found on the Internet. 
0	The usb port is a bit small, and the machine can’t respond quickly when typing on the keyboard. Some people say that the keyboard is not easy to use and not sensitive, and there is no such problem when typing slowly; and it is more troublesome to install the XP operating system! Moreover, Jingdong's price changes are also fast~! 
1	"I watched ""College Entrance Examination 1977"" a few weeks ago. Back then, there were many educated youths who went to Heilongjiang in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They often heard their parents talk about it, and the plot in the movie looked a bit familiar. This black lens is all about Beijing's educated youth who have gone to northern Shaanxi. They are relatively more isolated, but they are also shocked. There is just a sad perception: most educated youths from civilian families are hit and stay at the bottom of the valley, while most educated youths from elite families can tell the story of ""heaven will come to power""... "
1	"Professor Qu's ""Huangdi Neijing"" discusses the impact of lifestyle habits on health according to time (hours of the day, different ages in life), and this book on health from head to toe explains the origin of illness from a spatial perspective . Relative to the time discussion, this book can be used as a reference book. It is recommended that every family prepare one. If any part of the body is unwell, you can turn over the book first. More important than finding a temporary solution to the pain is to find out the problems in the living habits, adjust the living habits to obtain longer-term health, and prevent the ""inheritance"" of bad habits to the offspring. "
1	To tell the truth, buy the notebook with this configuration at this price~~~ Nothing is said. High performance-price ratio, the price is very affordable, the graphics card does not say, it is very good for the notebook. 3D games run smoothly. The system is not as difficult to install as rumored. 
1	The appearance is quite stylish and cost-effective! The design is very fashionable, the real machine is more beautiful than the photos, it is recommended! 
1	The hotel has better service and better location, but most of the taxis don't know how to get there. 
1	Super beautiful surface texture perfect screen! Order payment on the afternoon of June 18th, the goods arrived on the afternoon of the 19th, fast, continuous work for 8 hours, stable and trouble-free! 
0	I checked every book carefully when I received the goods, and I was very happy when I got it alive, and the packaging felt good, worth 9 yuan. After reading it in two or three hours in one breath, I found out that the book was a book. This book is not worth collecting, just take a look 
0	The standard single room I lived in was really small, a large bed in the room was full, and the facilities were extremely primitive. There was nothing but a TV and a kettle. The four-star standard actually did not reach the middle three-star Level of the level. The worst thing is that the hotel faces the street. There are actually three doors in the lobby and only the front entrance is seen. The door is facing the hotel elevator freely. It is not locked in the middle of the night and the security is poor. 
0	The name of the book is definitely to please people. I believe that many people like me, bought this book because of the title. There is nothing new in the content of the book, it is the one taught by my parents and teachers when I was young. Can be a determined reader. 
1	Location: Opposite Changchun Railway Station. Advantages: Convenient for friends who take the train. Disadvantages: The environment is a bit messy and the prices are higher, but there are many restaurants around. Room: Average size, clean bedding, a bit far from the road, quiet at night. The toilet and bathtub are a bit old. The soundproofing is average and there is no carpet in the corridor. We are facing the elevator, so the elevator stops and the human voice is noisy. Including double breakfast, more variety. Service: Moderately satisfactory, no special features, the doorman is female. 
1	I bought the tomato sp3, and the black screen couldn't move as soon as I played the video file. Later, I changed to a version of the system that I don't know what version of the system, and there was no black screen. Black screen problem, price is okay 
0	When I bought it, I saw it clearly. It was in Mandarin, but when I received it, it was in Cantonese and the color was not good. It was very dark. 
1	Lighter than expected, as far as ASUS Transformer is always concerned. . . The driver does not seem to be difficult to install as imagined. . . Overall it feels good. . . 
1	I’ve been reading it recently. Yesterday, I read the 3 chapters in one breath. It is recommended that parents and mothers at the end of pregnancy buy it. I have read this book to understand some behaviors of children. In fact, some behaviors of children are not necessarily what the old man said. Every action of the child is to actively express his emotions and feelings! As a parent, only by understanding the true feelings of the child can you better communicate with the child! Although I haven't finished reading it yet, I think what Teacher Sun said is really very reasonable. Many of the cases in it are reflected in my son! 
0	Insufficiency: 1: 1G memory is not enough to run the visita, but you can add it yourself 2: There is no drive disk, you can find trouble by yourself 3: The interface is vertical, and the interface is too small and inconvenient 4: The heat dissipation at the bottom docking station is not very good! ! 
0	There is no option to switch the operating mode of the SATA hard disk in the BIOS. It is not possible to install the original XP disk. You need to boot the installation with an integrated driver CD. There is no XP driver on the official website, only Vista’s. After searching the Internet for a long time, I found a full set of XP drivers provided by other friends. 
0	Very old hotel, the room is dirty and old, but the cleanliness of the beds is acceptable. The TV remote control is not easy to use, the windows cannot be opened at all, and there are some unknown advertisements outside. When I came back at 11 in the evening, I don’t know where the front desk clerk went? I was helpless to find other waiters and told the front desk to call early at 6:00 in the morning, and the front desk had confirmed it. The result was that my mobile phone had an alarm clock function, otherwise I would not be able to catch the plane. When checking out in the morning, I told 2 guests that they need to pay another 2 yuan of urban construction fee (it seems to be this fee, which is required by Gansu Province). When staying in other hotels in Gansu, other hotels are responsible for it. Although the money is not much, it can reflect the service level of the hotel. The only advantage is that this hotel can provide free pick-up service, but the car that came to pick up should not be the hotel's car, and I kept asking if I could rent his car by myself. However, the master has a simple attitude. It is no surprise that such a small city has such a level of service! ! 
1	I bought another book for my friend, so that everyone can feel the author's wisdom 
1	The configuration is strong, the price is affordable, and the mouse is also provided. The mouse is very exquisite. The screen LED is better than the LCD, mainly because the viewing angle is larger. Although the camera is only 30W, the effect is great. The wireless network card receives strong signals. In the same room, the computer of the previous generation network card has no signal, and the new network card has a strong signal. 
0	I have stayed in so many star hotels across the country, this hotel is the only experience I have checked out early, one word: bad 1. In the evening, the broadband started to be unavailable, and after making several calls, I said that I was repairing it in a perfunctory tone. . . Isn’t it easy to fix it from 7 pm to 12 am? Since the repair is not good, why not tell me directly? Delayed the work of staying guests, and also lost the reputation of their own hotel 2. I booked a big bed room a long time ago, but when I checked in, it was told that the room was full, saying that it was free to upgrade me to a business standard room. I also emphasized that I was asked to organize my luggage and put it at the reception desk early the next morning Double room, otherwise the room rate difference will be charged. . . . This is the first time that I have stayed in so many hotels. There is no business philosophy of “customer first” in the service industry. In the evening, the harassing phone calls continued, and they never turned down. . . Poor management 4. It is a business standard room, the furniture is old, bed linens and towels are yellow and dirty, and there is no food to consume in the room. For example, business hotels such as Jiajia and Jinjiang Inn are not good. Please check out early the next morning. , This hotel not only delayed my work on business trips (not able to access the Internet), but also destroyed my mood on business trips (perfunctory attitude). I still stayed at the Babao Hotel where I used to stay. Although the decoration is very general, at least it attracted me to stay in. The reason is: the service attitude is very kind 
0	Jingdong’s after-sales service has problems. I picked it up here in Wuhan and got the goods on June 7th. It was only shown that the order was completed today. In order to evaluate the product. The efficiency is a bit low! 
1	The hotel is cost-effective, and the transportation is very convenient.It is worth mentioning that the seafood street is not far across the hotel.It is very cheap and very affordable.Next time I go to Shenzhen, I will live in Guangshen. 
1	"I corrected the word in the third paragraph of the article ""Chuangxin"": ""Inferior"" should be the word ""novel"". I sincerely apologize to everyone for misunderstanding! Please forgive me, because I am a beginner, I hope you can help me so I won’t make mistakes in my future studies! thank you all! bwlzzl "
0	The delivery party has a small problem. I only called me once before delivery and I didn't receive it! He didn't even deliver to me on the same day~! ! Otherwise, the top 5 can be evaluated. I didn’t rush to comment later 
1	"""Worry and worry about the world"" ---- is the common feature of this group of thoughtful and insightful people, ""taking the rise and fall of the world as their own responsibility"" ---- is their noble character. The stronger this group is, the more hopeful our country and our nation will be. I hope this book can awaken some Chinese people and stop being addicted to ""entertainment"" and ""online games"". Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of a country. The destiny of the country bears our common destiny, and it must be ""soy sauce"". The chapters in this book are messy, with a strong sense of patchwork, and a friend who likes gorgeous rhetoric and careful writing-Shan. "
1	The room is very clean, totally worthy of the 3-star standard. The service attitude is okay. The security is also very alert and quiet. The breakfast is very poor. It is not so bad except for the breakfast. 
0	I bought this book because I read the overwhelming five-star reviews on the Internet. When I received it, I was disappointed. At best, it was a kind of workplace diary that was fine in the workplace. Critics said that it introduced several human resource methods and work skills. I really want to suggest to those critics, you should study~ 
1	Well, the machine is beautiful, the keyboard is good, and I also sent a liner bag and wipes. After picking up the goods, I went to the nearby McDonald's to surf the Internet. The effect of wireless Internet is good. The linux graphical interface is very friendly and full of functions. This battery is good and has a long battery life. The operation is ok, the heat dissipation is not large, continue to test~~ 
0	Stayed for one night on the weekend. The surrounding area of the hotel is still ok. It's very convenient to travel. On Sunday, you can go to the Huaguoshan Scenic Area and take a taxi for 25 yuan; if the room is old, the air conditioner leaked water for one night! The bathroom in the single room is very simple~ the buffet breakfast for 20 yuan is only at the level of 5 yuan~ Generally speaking, if the requirements are not high, you can only live anywhere. 
1	The service should be improved again. How come you have to meet the five-star standard? 
0	When using the power adapter, the heat generation is amazing, and I am worried that it will burn out. The touchpad is too sensitive. The buttons on the touchpad are indeed a bit hard. There is a problem of sinking when a piece of the upper left corner of the keyboard is pressed. Other places are fine. The fan does not have its own speed control function, which is a bit disappointing. It needs software speed control. 
0	Shopping, placing an order, everything is normal, but the book is not received, I call to know that it is out of stock, and there will be no stock in the near future. 
0	1. I charged 10 yuan for the subscription fee, but I can't make a call; 2. The toothbrush box is an empty box 3. No shopping bag is provided 
1	Under the same configuration, the cost performance is not super high, and the mainstream configuration cannot be eliminated at once. . . Under the current market, buying this configuration at this price is really worth it. . . 
1	The hotel has a first-class environment, the rooms are very satisfactory, comfortable, clean and hygienic, but the Chinese restaurant downstairs charges a lot, and if you call the nightclub next to the room, you will also charge a phone fee. It’s kind of that... but the overall feeling is still Compatible with the five-star standard. 
1	The price/performance ratio is very good, and the arrival is okay, it will be there in 3 days. Regarding the issue of heat dissipation, I don't think it is as bad as others have said. The touchpad is a bit hot here, but other places are pretty good. 
0	HP has too many pre-installed software, there are 72 processes, vista is too rubbish, the cpu is single-core, the special effects shutdown is still a bit slow, there are not many new notebook drivers, I want to change to xp only Can wait! 
0	I received the book at noon. The speed is very fast. I decided to go down yesterday. It is worthy of praise~ But I was disappointed after receiving it. This book does not have any packaging (maybe the original version is like this), that's fine, but the corners of the book are broken. There is also an opening on the upper edge of the cover. When you read the side of the book, it is not neat when you cut it. I really suspect it is a pirated copy. I will not buy it on Dangdang in the future: (Sad~ I bought so many books in Dangdang, the first time I met To such a thing, disappointed~ 
0	I watched TV while reading, and cried several times. I bought a novel this time because I wanted to absorb some survival power from it. I cried with a smile. The author’s expression of this kind of expression makes people feel even more grief. People feel that they have no reason not to live well. 
1	The price-performance ratio of Xuan Gong Hotel is relatively high (I stayed at 235 yuan this time), mainly because the location is really good, it is about 500 meters away from the main attraction of Foshan, the Zumiao Temple, and I just went for a walk. It is also very close to the commercial street. There are Ying Kee noodle restaurants, Da Ke, etc. nearby. It is very convenient to eat. Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, they are clean, and there is a parking lot (free) in front of the door. We lived in a house close to the street, which was a little noisy. I don’t know if it’s the same for Ctrip. When I left, I gave a VIP card, saying that the card can get a 50% discount next time (that is, 200 yuan). 
0	Too bad. Just sleep on the street. It is really humorous for Ctrip to include such a hotel. There is also Yanliang Hotel in Shiyan, which is said to be ok, why not contact me? It will be more convenient for us. 
1	Checked in from 7/22-7/24, the room was not bad, you can see the whole sea view, and the service of the hotel is also good. However, there are still some minor flaws. The hair of the previous residents in the bathtub was not cleaned, causing the hair to float up when the water was discharged, which was disgusting. In addition, the hotel’s catering does not reach the 4-star standard, there are few choices for food, and there are few buffets to eat at night. It's not half of the usual buffet in Shanghai. 
1	The transportation is convenient, the rooms are relatively dry, quiet and spacious, and overall it is fair. 
1	Well, I'm basically satisfied, but I'm a bit upset that the room allocated to the foreigner who went with me was bigger than mine. The water in the bathtub was broken, so I could only take a shower. However, they came to repair it very quickly. Although Mi has completely solved the problem, at least he is still very active. 
0	This so-called four-star hotel is quite poor, with very old rooms and very basic facilities. Booking through Ctrip requires a high price of nearly 500 yuan. Of course, there is no way, because it is the weekend and the peak tourist season in Chengde. However, other hotels do not have such high prices. In contrast, Tianbao Holiday is a hundred times stronger than here! 
1	"I like the one where the rabbit provokes aliens and the one where the rabbit is stacked and looks like a martial arts contest is so interesting. I showed it to my roommate. She actually said that the person who painted the book had a problem with the thoughts and reminded me of the past few days The statement about psychological depression seen in the mobile newspaper: If we laugh and laugh after watching ""Bunny Looking for Death"", it means that we are mentally healthy. I agree with it haha because I really enjoyed watching it! I admire the author’s whimsy...I sincerely hope that people who are always in a bad mood can laugh at life. In fact, there is really no trouble to get through~ "
0	At the beginning, I didn't see any shortcomings. VISTA is a bit slow, maybe you need to add memory to solve it. I hope to buy this one in a few months to give away the memory stick. 
0	Very strange problem, a DVD disc is included, and it is actually a PDF file of the manual! Don't you need to match the driver? Let customers go to the website to download? The driver download on HP's website is not very good. There are two completely different 1019TUs, which makes people wonder what to do. 
0	The installation of vista flagship version is relatively smooth, but the wireless network card in the driver disk is not driven correctly. According to the model NE771 mentioned by some friends, I downloaded it from the Internet and installed it smoothly~~ Also, the fever seems to be relatively large, and it is a bit of use in summer. Hot, ha ha ha... 
1	"Upgraded me to a ""Korean-style room"". I walked in and took off my shoes on the kang. There were only two big mattresses on the kang, which felt a little crude. The toilet toilet has a flushing device, which is good! "
0	When I arrived at the hotel, the defendant told me that the reserved room was sold for the hourly room. I waited for more than half an hour before moving in. The room was small and the air was not good. That night my wife came for an official holiday and soiled the sheets. The hotel asked me to pay 300 yuan (room charge) 260 yuan), I understood that I entered the black shop and the hotel had a strong attitude. Later, after communicating with Ctrip and the hotel, they said that the cost price of the item could be reduced to 200 yuan. I still couldn’t accept it. Then I contacted Ctrip and said it was a hotel regulation. There was nothing I could do. Later, the front desk actually charged me the long-distance fee for calling Ctrip. It was 12 yuan for 6 minutes. I expressed a strong protest and the hotel stopped. The above process took us 1 hour in total. I really can’t afford to pay for the time. Money left, but I still hope ctrip can give a reasonable explanation 
0	The 2.5-inch 250G mobile hard disk provided by the machine is unopened, I want to sell it, and I am interested in short-term contact, Beijing 1391019711 
0	I bought a set for my daughter last year. I feel that both the content and the printing quality are very good. I ordered a set for my friend's child a few days ago, and it was disappointing after receiving it! I feel that the printing quality is much worse, the colors are not bright, the picture is not clear, and the mood is heavy! 
0	When the elevation angle of the display screen is too large, the computer will be easily tilted up on the table. There is a small design problem. The camera needs to be bright and strong to use. If the light is dark at night, the display will be unclear 
0	1. Delivery is slow, order on 19th, payment on 20th, arrival on 28th 2. If the joint insurance policy is not filled out or stamped, the joint insurance policy sent is useless, 3. There is no Chinese manual, there are two papers with all the words, but no MSI logo was found. The battery is not original, I suspect it is parallel imports 
0	I bought it for a friend, and I read it roughly. I like the one written by Teacher Qu Limin better, but my friend likes it very much. The biggest advantage of this book is that there is a set of human acupoint maps 
0	The system runs a bit slow, barely acceptable. The hard drive makes squeaking noises from time to time, and most ASUS notebooks seem to have this problem. The screen color performance does not seem to be as gorgeous as other brands (such as gateway netbooks). 
1	I have stayed at this hotel for at least four times, and make a simple evaluation: The room is large enough to meet the four-star standard, but some rooms are a bit older; the room facilities are quite satisfactory, and the internet speed of the computer It's ok; I appreciate the petals in the bathroom, which is quite good; the attitude of the room attendant is very good, I appreciate it; the overall feeling is good, recommended! ! ! 
0	"I ordered ""Du Lala's Promotion"" on November 22 and paid through the bank. Why hasn't the order arrived for more than two weeks? "
1	Nice restaurant, the food is done well, it is worth living here in Weifang 
1	Books are very good and cost-effective. It looks like nv's graphics card is not as strong as ATI. The main reason is that Intel has less heat 
0	The room booked by Ctrip on the same day arrived at the hotel in less than one hour, but I was told that the room type was no longer available. I don’t know how the hotel is managed. If the reservation is not made in good faith, then don’t rely on Ctrip. ! Moreover, he gave feedback to Ctrip with untrue information. It was clear that he checked in, but there was no feedback! This time the reservation was made for my client, but it caused such troubles! Will not consider this hotel again in the future! 
1	So happy to finally get this book. White, very delicate. No problem watching online videos. 
0	It's strange to me. Why can't I see the good points when reviewing such a good book? The child doesn't seem to be very interested. 
1	As a two-star hotel, I booked a suite. The room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was large, with shower room, and the service was in place. The problem was that the waiter’s Mandarin needed to be strengthened 
0	I'm getting more and more disappointed with the so-called bestsellers in Tibet. This book reads the same, no matter from the perspective of the novel or the psychological book, it is very inadequate. Some of Bi Shumin's novels are not bad. This one... is too disappointed. Up 
0	The partitioning is really unreasonable. Except for the backup area and the recovery area, all other places and the system are placed in a 200g disk. If you partition this disk directly, you are afraid of affecting the system. 
1	Very good hotel, it is very convenient in terms of services, facilities, transportation, location, etc. Many guests will specify this hotel 
0	This book captured the hearts of the female compatriots, and there are so many books with this name now. This is a really bad book. Don't buy it. I regret it! 
1	The location is quite good, only five minutes' walk away from Harbour City, the hotel rooms are brightly lit and the LCD TV is big enough to feel very comfortable. Only the hotel lobby is a bit small. I will choose this hotel next time. 
0	The calorific value is a bit higher than that of a thicker notebook, and the touch button driver for volume adjustment has not been found yet 
0	The heat dissipation is not very good.Generally, it is about 47 when opening a webpage, about 54 when installing software, and about 65 when installing a CD. 
0	There is a bright spot, unfortunately; it seems that there are a lot of bright computers, and mine is in the middle position, very unhappy 
0	The smelliest, worst and most unbearable notebook in history! The more I listen, the more I want to smash it! It's not as good as my Sony Ericsson G700C phone speaker! The exhaust vent is on the left, wondering! Maybe it’s because you can “bake” the fire when your hands are cold and you can’t touch the keyboard in winter. It’s also a “humanized” design. 
0	It is very depressing that the c drive is not partitioned. I transferred the things from the old computer to the notebook. As a result, I used more than 20G of space and there was no way to back it up. 
1	"A seemingly simple color book, but surprising and unexpected contents appear everywhere. For example, it becomes a completely different map with a slight pull, and you keep getting new knowledge when you keep turning over the folding pages. I bought almost all the pop-up books of Le Fun for my son, his favorite is this one, and ""Save the Earth"" is also very good. The content is incisive and fun. Although it is more expensive than ordinary books, it has surpassed the value of ordinary books to give children a brand-new enjoyment of reading. "
1	The hotel is very suitable for people who go to Liyang for business or tourism. The breakfast buffet is very rich, and the internal environment and service of the hotel are very good. The only downside is that the entrance of the hotel is too messy at night, and all kinds of vehicles and people are crowded at the entrance. Additional comments May 9, 2008: The water pressure in the shower in the room is unstable. Hotel Feedback May 13, 2008: Thank you very much for choosing to stay at Jinling Liyang Hotel. The affirmation and appreciation you gave us encouraged us and made us more confident to do our daily service work. It is because of the continuous encouragement and appreciation from many guests like you that the hotel's service quality can be continuously improved. We have taken corresponding measures for the order of the hotel entrance and the shower water problem in the room. Once again, I would like to express our most heartfelt thanks to you! We look forward to seeing you again! 
1	It is far away from downtown Huzhou and it is not very convenient to take a taxi. However, there are buses at the door and there are many shifts. It is best to have a car by yourself. The lake view room is not near the lake and only overlooks the Taihu Lake. The hotel is on the mountain and is relatively quiet. There is no service fee for room delivery, and the dishes are relatively cheap, but the dishes are more salty, and the room does not provide water, only water from a kettle 
1	Edward's sordid smile in the movie fits well with the novel. But I also began to worry about how 19-year-old Christine should interpret bella in the following movie. In the first part, she can still have a big tongue, and she can be ignorant and fearless. Next, it seems to challenge acting a little bit more. look forward to. . The translation is still not good enough. Who told me that I dare not take the original version for myself. I can only read it first. Looking forward to a better translation. After all, Mel is from a cobain, and I believe her writing is more than that. . . 
0	"The location is good, very close to the commercial center, political center and the Yellow River. But the service is so poor that even Samsung in the eastern region is not as good. 1. During the day the doorman speaks openly to idlers without greeting guests 2. Stayed in the hotel for 2 days, and none of the service staff took the initiative to say ""hello"" when they met 3. The breakfast is too poor, the variety is small, and the service is poor. If you don't take the initiative, there will be no waiter asking you if you want coffee, and the chef who cooks omelette is mostly missing and has a bad attitude at the time. 4. The hotel hasn't been opened for a long time, but the carpets are very dirty, and there are no cotton swabs. 5. The structure of the hotel is strange, and it feels like it was designed as a government office building. 6. The elevator speed is very slow, there are 3 passenger elevators in total, and the control button is not connected to the Internet. 7. Anyone can use the passenger elevator. I have seen people who deliver couriers and meals. 8. The position of the deputy manager/manager in the lobby is empty. I have only seen a few soldiers sitting there often, which is strange. All in all it was a very unpleasant experience. I stayed at the Feitian Hotel on August 18, and later changed this hotel on the 21st because I thought it was too old. But this hotel is much worse than Feitian Hotel. It was really a wrong decision. (Please refer to my evaluation at Feitian Hotel) Additional comments August 23, 2006: The big bed in the double room is not big at all. The most surprising thing is that after the waiter cleaned up the room in the morning, I went back and took a look. The chair was still mine. When I left, I didn't recover at all, and the plastic bag of disposable slippers I threw on the ground was not taken away. There is no turndown service at all. The bottled water of the water, once the water ran out, I called it 20 minutes later. Too bad, it is recommended not to live. "

0	"It feels very bad. There is no place to entertain and eat in the lot. The room is gloomy. Service attitude is also very poor. The most interesting thing is that the gym charges guests. I went to check and said, ""I haven't heard that the hotel gym charges guests."" As a result, the old man said, ""I haven't heard of it now!"" He was very unremarkable and rude. Never live again next time. Additional comments May 12, 2008: Also, it rained in the morning, and I found out that the hotel does not help people call taxis when I went out. I had to brave the rain and walked to the back street corner to call a taxi. Drenched in the rain. four-star? I don't think it is as good as the guest house. "
0	Hotels should pay attention to software construction! Especially the front desk! ! We went to check in and actually told us that there is no our name and the room is now full. After checking for a long time, I told you to change to Jinjiang. I went to Jinjiang to see the room, and then went back to swipe the card after agreeing. The lady at the front desk was arrogant: We found it, this time it is your own fault! Not the responsibility of the hotel! You are late, so we cancelled the reservation. Say the name using your partner's name. 
1	Good location, in the city center. The hotel has good service and rich breakfast. The computer broadband speed in the business digital room I live in is satisfactory, and the room is fairly clean, close to Hunan Road Snack Street. 
1	XP system CPU occupies 46% on average. XP system only occupies CPU. XP driver is hard to find. 
0	The room I booked is the smallest room in this hotel and the smallest of all the hotels I have stayed in. It cannot be too small. No wardrobe, no coffee table, no bathtub. I stayed for 5 nights. A massage lady knocked on the door at 1:40 midnight on the 3rd day and called the reception desk to complain. Although a security guard came over immediately, I did not get any apology from the hotel. 
0	Only stayed for one night, the room was small, but considering that it was only a three-star hotel, the requirements could not be too high, but the facilities in the room were very outdated, and some facilities were obviously broken for a long time and were not repaired. My credit card is not from the four major state-owned banks, so I can’t do pre-sales. I can’t swipe my card directly. The lady at the front desk said that my card is not a credit card, so I feel dizzy. Even if I don’t recognize the visa logo, I should recognize the UnionPay logo. Well, it wouldn't be said that you can't even swipe your card like a savings card! 
0	The service is relatively poor, and there are often harassing calls at night. What I am most dissatisfied with is that I just made a long-distance call for 2 minutes. They said that my call was not hung up properly, and the billing system continued to calculate. As a result, I charged me 60 yuan. I heard that the breakfast was poor, so I didn't try it. 
0	There is no essential difference from the soul chicken soup. At least I don’t like to read the classics like this, and interpret the classics as such a taste of de-Chinese. 
0	"Through Ctrip, I booked a package of 950 yuan for three standard rooms, and stayed in with three friends of nine people. Since the children are relatively young, I went directly to the hotel and asked to change the standard room to a double-bed room. The hotel said that the double-bed room has a sloping roof and you can see the stars. I checked into the hotel on May 2 and the front desk informed that ""there is no elevator"". Since the room was on the third floor, everyone thought it was affordable, so they carried their luggage against the stroller and the child, and followed the waiter to the room. It turned out that the hotel was connected to many buildings. Our room was separated from the reception desk in 2 buildings. We followed the waiter up and down one floor and one floor, then another floor and another turn, and finally returned. It took a slope to reach the room where you can see the stars. The room is about 10 square meters, and half of the space is a sloping roof eaves. The sun shines in through two small bay windows, making this room without stools not too small. Since the guests just checked out during the holiday season, the waiter immediately re-made our beds. With the shaking of the sheets, I noticed countless dust floating in the air. However, this was only the beginning of the nightmare. After dinner, I realized that I was lost between the restaurant and the guest room. I kept walking through the corridors and up and down the stairs between the houses. It took about 15 minutes before I finally took it. Smelly sweating back to the room. I wanted to take a bath but found that the water pipes were all rusty water. I asked the front desk and did not respond. After 20 minutes, my third call finally got the answer: ""The engineering department reported that there is no problem with the boiler, please It should be fine to release more water.” After the rusty water continued to release for 15 minutes, I finally broke out on the fourth call. With my scolding, two engineers and a waiter appeared. I can't care about what they did in the bathroom, because it took nearly 2 hours from the discovery of the problem to the final solution. I fell asleep after taking a shower. I was woken up several times in the middle of the night. In order to save money, the hotel’s central air conditioner was turned off at night. I must tell everyone not to stay in this hotel. By the way, the so-called fishing place in the hotel is a small pond. The water in it has been nutrified. I stayed there for an afternoon and I didn’t see anyone catching any fish. There were a lot of flies in the barbecue area, and there was another one. Little flying insects stare at people's eyes exclusively, which is very disgusting. "

1	The environment is relatively good, as a local upgraded four-star hotel in Liuzhou, it is quite good! The attitude of the waiter is also very good. Domestic long-distance calls in the room are free, which is only available in Liuzhou area! More distinctive!

0	Why is such a mediocre work so popular? sweat! Workplace novels appeared soon, and they have already been fired to death. In China, everything is a fast word. It appears fast, and die fast! Why is the Chinese people's sheep-like nature so full? One is that our reading ability is completely destroyed by our education, and people with very high academic qualifications also lack the basic reading ability. In addition, under the dictatorship of the central government for more than 2,000 years, China has killed all the people with personalities. We are all descendants of obedient people who lack ideas! ! ! ! ! 
0	When booking, it was stated that you would like a room on the second floor, and it was on the first floor when you checked in. The Internet said that an additional breakfast was 10 yuan, and the actual charge was 15 yuan. Staying in a hotel also pays 10 yuan for parking. The carpet in the deluxe single room was soggy, I was speechless. But the hotel environment is good, unfortunately this environment 
1	This is definitely the most cost-effective one in the authentic tp series (except sl). The heat dissipation is good, nothing to say, and it's quiet enough to shut down. The original software is very rich. 
1	After I received it, I read about it and I only learned the second chapter. It feels very good, the content is informative, and the structure is good. There are test situation analysis, main test sites, knowledge framework, test question analysis, synchronous training and answer analysis, etc. For people like me who mainly rely on self-study, they can help me better understand the content of the textbook and have a multiplier effect. A little bit of a fly in the ointment, is that the printed fonts are a bit smaller, which seems a bit laborious, probably because of the saving of purchase costs for everyone? It is a pity that I would rather spend a higher price in exchange for a more comfortable reading. 
1	I really love Steve. He can understand women’s mentality and secrets so much, and he can tell the whole man’s psychology, and he is so funny and humorous. No wonder so many women who have sex with him are still good friends with him after breaking up. , I hope he can live longer, because Steve can bring them happiness (⊙ o ⊙ )! Steve is great and handsome. He is a good friend and a good husband once married! I found that all men in the world are similar. It turns out that foreigners and men like women’s jeans, T-shirts, and ponytails the most. No matter how old you are, (*^__^*) Hee... 
0	The shower head fell off by itself and was repaired later. The toilet has been blocked. Asked for repairs twice, the attitude was very good, but the technology was not good, but in the end it was not solved, and the stool was suffocated! 
0	It was pre-installed with VISTA. I bought it for my friend. My friend didn't like it. I could only reinstall it with my Lenovo OEM-XP disk. Lenovo is not very kind at this point. Everyone doesn't like to use Vista, why not give an XP at a reasonable price, practical and cheap, and fast. One key recovery does not support XP? 
1	"Only after I got the book, I saw that it is suitable for children between 3 and 5 years old. I first looked at it and found it a little difficult for a two-and-a-half-year-old child. But when I went home to show the child, she still liked those pictures and gave her When I talked about the book ""I'm Looking for the Stars"" and talked about the starfish that the chick found, when her companion laughed and cried, she didn't expect her daughter to cry very sad. I thought she didn't understand it, but she still didn't understand. The heart of the child, but this book is still a bit esoteric for the child. Parents need to pay more attention and explore more interesting things inside, so that the child will like it. "
0	I have been repeating that if a man wants to praise his performance, if a woman wants to listen to the point of view is a bit single, at least it can't give me any enlightenment and help. It is very different from what I expected at the beginning. Personal feeling is very general. 
1	Appearance: I think the design of 3 USBs is quite good, which is quite reasonable. One on the right, pick up the mouse. Two are on the left, which is also very convenient. What about the operating system installation? It's okay, it's not special, but it was done in one day. Thanks to netizens, see the summary. . .

1	"After reading ""Four Generations Under One Roof"", I began to think that Mr. Lao She should be the best writer in China since the May Fourth Movement. The history of the Anti-Japanese Period may be so-called war films. In this book, I have seen the lives of ordinary people. When I was reading, I would often ask myself, if I was there, would I fight the war and would I live with dignity. I started to download an e-book and read it on my mobile phone. I found that there were some cuts in the book, which really disgusted me. A great work has some bytes deleted by certain standards, which is really disrespectful to the words. "
1	"Comment on ""Wang Xizhi's Brushwork and Its Rheological Research"" and the analysis of the system of ""Zhang Cao"" and ""Jin Cao"" in this article is somewhat vague and even confusing. In fact, the cursive (simplification) of Chinese fonts has been continuing, and it is easier to understand from a certain meaning (font characteristics). Zhang Cao and Jin Cao are caused by the shorthand and quick writing of the official script and the regular script (ie. Evolve into), but this is more obvious, so the ""brushwork"" difference between the two is prominent. "
0	It is very superficial, and the discussion is especially like a model essay for elementary school students. It is still a very exemplary argumentative essay, with a total score and a few examples in the middle. Feeling fooled, don't like it. 
0	The panel is prone to fingerprint traces. After the memory is expanded, the BIOS must be upgraded to display 2G and there is no introduction in the manual. 
0	The waiter didn't think he had long hair during dinner! When I finished the bath, I noticed that there were long hair on the towel too! Home Inns has always been a model of express hotels in my mind, but this time staying at Beijing Tuanjiehu Store was shocking. 
1	The hotel is newer, the service is good, there is a small convenience store next to it, but the room price is expensive... 
1	This book doesn’t talk much about skin care, and the massage methods are not written. The explanation of skin care is generally vague. There are also some recipes for DIY facial mask and lotion that seem to be searched on the Internet. I haven’t tried it, so I don’t dare use . However, the author’s mentality is very good. This book gives people a new life. The sunshine and freshness in the text make people very comfortable. Women must learn to love themselves. Many people are afraid of becoming yellow-faced women after giving birth. But in this book I can also be more beautiful when I see being a mother. I like this book very much. It's like a woman's narrative. Maybe it turns out that I can make life so delicate! 
0	The driver CD is not perfect, and the latest driver needs to be downloaded from the Internet. The keyboard feels too bad and the noise is loud. The software is not perfect. There is no basic notebook software such as CPU frequency control and brightness adjustment. No basic accessories such as carrying case and mouse.

The windows were closed when we entered the room, indicating that it was not clean before. . There are few types of breakfast and poor quality. . Milk is made of powdered milk, coffee is instant, soy milk has a strange taste, and porridge has a bad taste. . This kind of breakfast actually costs 30RMB. . The most annoying thing was that dinner. Because everyone was tired, I ate at the hotel. I called to ask if there were any special dishes. There were too many special dishes and I didn't tell them. There is no minimum consumption limit in the hotel rooms, but we are not allowed to enter, just because we say we can't eat 400 yuan. . The lobby is the one where breakfast is served. The tablecloths are all torn and the serving is extremely slow. . You have to wait a long time for the second one after eating one dish. . I waited until my stomach ache, which hurt all night. . The later dishes also had problems. There were unknown objects in the black rice, cylindrical, about 2 mm long, and the cut surface was similar to a ballpoint pen refill. .

0	The built-in software is too much and too complicated, not suitable for super novices, even the drivers are very large, and the installation is exhausting. 
0	The facilities are outdated and look unclean. Among the hotels booked by Ctrip, this one feels the worst. 
1	The hotel's facilities and environment are good, that is, there are no markets or supermarkets around, and you can see the endless sea from the balcony of the room. I am really in a good mood. The only thing is that the breakfast is the same thing every day. It's not too far from the airport and the city. (It can be done within 30 yuan). 
1	Another highlight of this book is that there is a corresponding analysis of exercises behind each knowledge point, and details such as exercise analysis, error prompts, and point analysis are set for different knowledge points. The pictures and texts are all rare in the market. A good reference book. 
1	Arrived at 9pm, but the front desk said that Ctrip had not made a decision and recommended another room to me. Due to the heavy rain outside, the phone was damaged by the rain, so I had to move in. Ctrip confirmed on the phone the next day and said that it was indeed ordered for me, maybe they made a mistake at the front desk, or it was a newcomer. Although a little unpleasant, they have a good attitude. 
1	Because it is a honeymoon trip, the hotel will upgrade the garden view room to the super sea view room on the 5th floor for free, you can see the beautiful Victoria Bay, and a bottle of good wine will be given away. The rooms are clean and big, and the hotel service is good. Although the hotel is not in the city center, the hotel's shuttle bus is very convenient. It usually goes to and from Tsim Sha Tsui every half an hour. In fact, when you leave the hotel, there are sasa and body shop, and there is also a shopping center. You can do simple shopping on the first day of arrival. 
0	Delivery is very slow. The payment for the order placed on the 9th was completed in the afternoon of the 16th. The EMS was only available for three days. I can only say that the delivery of the goods is slow. Also, the price reduction is really too fast. Hey, little depressed 
0	The power consumption is too fast, some drivers cannot be installed and the price drops quickly, and the time to buy it is not the time. It is a day or two to declare that I sign for it, but I did not call me when the delivery came, and the packaging was torn. I don't know if it was deliberate by the courier

0	The check-in and check-out payment of the service in the lobby is very slow. The waiter is ignorant to answer questions. The IC card power supply in the room is broken. There are many problems with the electronic control. The water in the bathtub is not smooth. Breakfast will be after 7 o'clock.. ..... Won't go again.

1	The hotel is very nice, the double bed room is quite big, the room is quite big, all the facilities are good, the bathroom has two separate spaces for the bathtub and the shower, the service is also very thoughtful, I even called on the second night of the stay Come to ask any comments and suggestions for the hotel. As soon as you leave the hotel, you will find the trestle bridge, which is a bit far from the May Fourth Square. A taxi is about ten to twenty yuan. Overall it is good, I will choose this hotel next time I visit Qingdao. 
1	I bought a new birthday gift for my girlfriend. This time, Jingdong delivered it very quickly. It was scheduled on Thursday afternoon and delivered on Friday. The speed of the machine is good, the metal feels very good, and it is much more beautiful than the ones seen on the Internet. The screen looks very comfortable, especially the small details such as the switch indicator light are very attractive to girls. 
0	It may be the misleading of other people's comments. This book still doesn't make much sense. It records a picture of a woman with no characteristics in a flowing water! Why are so many published? It is strange! 
0	I checked into the hotel on August 4, but I didn't expect many places to be unsatisfactory. I had to shorten the itinerary and return to Beijing early. I checked online before and wanted to stay in a special hotel, so I chose the deluxe standard room here. But I did not expect: (1) The hotel is being demolished and it is very dirty and noisy. The taxi driver told us to watch it in three years and said it must be different. The house assigned to us faces the road, facing a large construction site, and is extremely noisy. Two of the rooms cannot be exchanged upon request. The front desk was very reluctant to change, and told the house to be smaller than this. At that time, in order to be quiet, I had to agree, but later I found out that I was fooled. (2) The two exchanged rooms are estimated to be ordinary standard rooms. The walls and cabinets in the room have mottled moisture marks. The toilet in one room is often broken. The room is small, only one person can pass between the desk and the bed. The most hateful thing is that the windows have no screens and face the aisle, risking the threat of mosquitoes. After opening the window, it is found that there is no ventilation. Because the aisle windows are tightly closed, the smell of musty and paint in the room cannot escape. What's more, because of the surrounding house structure, some people talk in the aisle sooner or later, and the lanterns in the aisle are on all night. Through the flimsy curtains, I had to endure light pollution. The soundproofing effect of the room is very poor, and I need to endure the sound of watching TV next door. There is no central air conditioning. (3) The service level is average. On the second day of the exchange of rooms, the interrogation front desk requested to change to a deluxe standard room. The front desk said that because they requested the exchange, they did not make up the difference, and said that the existing room was the discounted price of 338 yuan. This is in Chengde! The front desk service is very poor. Although they are beautiful in national costumes, they have a cold attitude. But he bowed to a foreigner before me. (4) Breakfast is difficult to swallow. Because it is surrounded by villages, breakfast can only be served at the hotel. Four or five small pickles; two kinds of porridge, bean buns, steamed buns, and milk powder made very thin. Even if this kind of breakfast is gone after 8:30. Start cleaning, regardless of whether the guests have finished eating. I regret very much that I chose this hotel with the worst price/performance ratio. I wanted to rest for a few days, but the accommodation was really bad. I just stayed for two nights and then checked out. 
1	Too average. The network is slow at the same level as the snail. It’s high speed. It’s really dizzy. 
1	"I still like ""To Our Dying Youth""! It is like an invisible slender hand, unconsciously, it has touched my heartstrings: the same heartbeat, the same sadness, the same youth and frivolous experience. In the head. If there is really a time shuttle that can bring us back to the past, I think I have found it! That is Xin Yiwu's ""To Our Youth Who Will Be Passed""! "
0	It has been popular for 40 years, at least it is also a picture book of 1968. The story of 1968 does not seem to arouse any interest in my daughters. It is not attractive to me either. Hope the children will be more interested.

1	The moment I saw the computer was very excited. I used it all afternoon and I felt that I liked the appearance and it was cute??? But I saw the Jingdong price again at night~ I was dumbfounded. Yesterday’s 6488 became 5866??? Really depressing ??? But just like it. Some things are unexpected. Haha :) 
1	The standard three-star standard is the same as the five-star standard, but the grade looks lower, but it is very clean. The rooms are also relatively large. Some rooms have a small refrigerator, some do not. The service is in place. The environment is also good. Internet speed Very fast, and no money. Pre-authorization is possible and the checkout is fast. 
1	[Recommended Books] It is difficult to choose popular science books for children around three years old. It is necessary for such a small baby to be exposed to the wonders of scientific phenomena, and use books to cultivate the baby’s scientific interest. Don’t say that we readers choose such books, the author I believe that writing books and publishing books by publishers are all very difficult. This set of fantastic science uses vivid descriptions, vivid and interesting. With the help of many animals, it shows the little babies the wonders of science, which is refreshing. Coupled with high-quality and exquisite printing and low prices, it is really the best choice for the introduction of popular science for young babies. 
1	After seeing Chapter 6, I feel that the content is indeed as stated in the book. In fact, many of the daily interpersonal communication skills really have no mystery. They are just small details that need to be paid attention to in daily life. But it is these small details that can play a big role. The content is worth seeing! But I feel that I only need to look at the content and chapter names in English at the beginning of each chapter, not the chapter names in Chinese. Chinese chapter names are not only very problematic in translation (even if we consider it from the perspective of free translation rather than literal translation), but they are basically irrelevant to the chapter content itself. 
1	Enter the BIOS and change the configuration to IDE interface! Poor heat dissipation! It's too hot, it is recommended that the price or less money to buy other models! 
1	"After reading the straw house, I started a new reading. It was ""Bronze Sunflower"" that made me cry several times. I think my children will not only understand the poverty of that era in the book, but also know the current rural areas. Some children are still living this kind of life. I always like to say ""God is fair"", but I can't face the unfair reality that touched me in the book. I often reflect on myself and contribute too little to society! I should take my child out more and take him to help those who are living in poverty! "
0	The environment is noisy and the service is not good. I gave the wrong room card when I entered the room. I was shocked when I entered the room. Someone was living. I quickly went downstairs and asked the counter to say that I was wrong. When I entered the room, the smoke level was very heavy. I said that I was going to do a smoke-free treatment. When I came, I said that the smoke-free treatment is just to remove the ashtray. The smell of smoke will dissipate in a few days. I said that I would spray with a detergent, but the smell of smoke is still very heavy after spraying, which is really unacceptable. There is a lot of mud on the road ahead. The breakfast was delivered to the room and it was not tasty. Service attitude is not good. The washing machine in the room is gone, how can I wash my clothes?

I hope the manufacturer will test it before leaving the factory. , Direct grid disk, anyway, I don’t need linux

0	Dear members: Happy Chinese New Year and safe seasons! Greetings! I am a Hongkonger living in a small place, but I have never seen such a small standard room in a hotel in the mainland. Honestly speaking, this hotel room is so small! Obese brothers and sisters have difficulty walking around! As the previous member said! The seat of the bathroom floor and water closet has hair and cannot stand upright! The hotel and room color is OK! Inconvenient location far away from the stations! The environment is not very good, the houses are too close to the windows! The price of RMB300 is not worth it! I do not recommend! ! ! 
1	"Or maybe, after reading all the four manuals of type A, type B, type O, and type AB, you feel that what is said in the book is not very accurate, then congratulations. In you, a new type of blood has probably been born. You might as well give your own blood type a unique name, for example, Type X, and then you can write a ""Instruction for Type X People"" for yourself. Maybe, many X-types will find resonance because of this, and feel that they are no longer alone in this world. "
0	It feels so-so and knows the truth, but there is no operational guidance. Maybe young girls who have just entered society can take a look and expand their thinking. 
0	1. The usb-cdrom installation system made by mass-produced U disk cannot be used. It is too laborious to install the system without optical drive. Bios should strengthen research and development; 2. The heat generation is not low and the fan is always buzzing; 3. The keyboard is small. 
0	Seeing other comments that it is suitable for children under the age of 10, I bought it for my 8-year-old son. As a result, I decided to give it away as soon as I entered the door. 
1	I have always liked Yishu's literary talent. Delicate and sad. I have always wanted to be a writer, but found that I don't have enough stories. Only those who have stories can write words that make themselves and others like them. . . . I like Bill likes all the characters. When I find myself reading a book, I always get caught in the book. When they are sad, they follow their sadness. They are happy when they are happy. They always feel that reading is very hurtful. It always takes a long time. I will return to my own world, but I still can’t help but read a lot of books. Maybe this is my choice. It’s very comfortable to dance with the book. 
0	I didn’t buy the book, and asked me to write a review. It’s true. Maybe it’s too popular. The sales are so good. I didn’t write out of stock. The book was not sent to me. 
0	I don't know if the book is not good, or it gives too much hope. From the beginning to the end, there are two feelings: 1. The quality of the paper is really very, very, very good, so that it is habitual to turn back one page to determine if it is turned over. 2. This is a book that brainwashes readers. If you don't want to be brainwashed before reading and do not have your own firm values, then after reading this book, it will become a little thing that changes your life. But fortunately, it’s a translation. There is no special tightness between the words, leaving people breathing space. 
0	In a small alley, the average taxi driver cannot be found. The lobby is very distinctive, I thought it had entered an indoor theme exhibition), regardless of European style decoration. Although the room is not big (double bed room), it is acceptable. In the most interesting room, there are so many products on sale, like entering a small supermarket. Drinks, instant noodles, bottled water, tea, snacks, and playing cards are all charged. Walking into the bathroom is more like entering an adult goods store, underwear, and condoms. Aphrodisiac, and there are even DIY tools for women. The shower room is too small. It is recommended that those who are taller than 1.85 meters and weighed more than 180 kilograms must be careful, and do not move too much during the bath, so as not to touch the surrounding walls/glass or roof! Also, the soundproofing of the room is really bad. The sound of people next door going to the bathroom and brushing their teeth is audible. It is recommended that brothers and sisters who are more dynamic should not stay at High, otherwise it is estimated that the whole hotel can share your happiness! But there are also good points: first, free broadband, faster Internet speed; second, bathing water is relatively large; third, the doorman is enthusiastic, which is rare in Beijing. 
0	1. There is a bright spot on the upper right of the screen 2. It should be fine if the memory is larger. A blue screen appears when installing the driver, and it will be normal after the installation in safe mode 3. The system needs to be reinstalled 4. No mouse is equipped 
1	My son is 33 months old. He likes this book very much. I have posted all the books in one night. The quality of the books is very good. I am satisfied. The paper is thick. After the child wants to repost it, it will not damage the paper. . The content covered in the book is very rich, with a few aspects, creative aspects, and graphics distinguishing aspects. Children are very interested and easy to learn. Parents only need to cooperate with the children to explain the requirements of the picture, and the child can complete the sticker completely by his own ability, which is very fulfilling and encourages his interest. 
0	The room is oversized, the noise is loud, and the boss in Zhejiang is always short of weight. 
1	The battery can be charged for about 4 hours! Small and good-looking, very suitable for girls! 
0	Without an operating system, you have to install it yourself; the mouse cord delivered is too short, and the others are looking for it. At present, the sound quality does not seem to be very good. 
0	I live here every time I take a break, not because of how good this hotel is, mainly because it is more convenient to get on and off the highway. The rooms are average and the restaurant food is poor. 
1	The optical drive is easy to uninstall, which is a more user-friendly advantage. And the partition can be changed with partition software. The design of the remote control is also quite novel, you can control the playback of ppt^_^, you can lie down and watch movies. 
0	There are 7 missing pages in the book. To be precise, it is 7 pages of white paper. You save ink, but I suffer from it. It seems that there is no continuity. Sometimes it is incomprehensible and the storyline cannot be connected. Annoying. 
0	This set of books is the most unsuccessful set I bought. I feel that it is a bit messy when I got the book, and the colors are not very bright. Maybe there is still a big difference between foreign culture and Chinese culture! I don't want to read it! I don't know how other babies react to this book? 
0	Objectively speaking, this hotel is not very good. List it for your reference: 1. I arrived at 8:30 in the evening and did not see the doorman; 2. No hair dryer. 3. The network cable was placed behind the TV cabinet. Only after calling the guest room center did I know that there was a network cable; 4. 2. I wanted to check out ten minutes late, but the front desk said there was no way to charge extra money. After staying in so many hotels, I saw such a dull first time. 5. I asked for an envelope when I checked out. No. 6. The water bill was not given to me when I checked out, so I called to ask for it, and asked me to check it after 1:30. Can this kind of hotel be starred? 
1	"The most true and practical white-collar growth story is also the most profound summary of white-collar life and work I have ever read. Not only did I benefit a lot from watching it, but I also found it enjoyable and exciting, and I am proud of having such an outstanding hitman in China. After reading it, there was indeed: ""... what reminds me the most is not the moments of success in the journey of life, but the unforgettable failures or setbacks..."" It shows a true and sincere person, a sincere person. Share with you how to succeed, not a genius story, a working god. highly recommended! "
1	Dangdang is basically buying books. After all, the price of Dangdang is relatively cheap, the quality of the books is good, and there are always more activities, and there are often coupons, so I basically choose Dangdang to buy books. Free shipping activities are also very good now, but when there are more purchases, there is no bigger discount and I feel a little insufficient. In addition, if you encounter a problem, the solution will be a bit slower, and you must have a certain amount of patience. This is not very good. If you can improve it, it will be more perfect. I hope that you can contact us in time. 
1	I live in seven buildings. The general evaluation of the place is: there are many trees, few people, long roads, low buildings, old houses, and slow internet. I don’t know how the main building is, I feel that it’s worthwhile to experience it here, but I won't stay here next time. Just to mention, the service is really good. Before I went out, suddenly the trousers stall opened and I was in a hurry to leave. The waiter quickly took it to help me with it, and there was no charge. 
0	Far from the city, the bath is not smooth, construction outside at night, bad attitude of the waiter, garbage hotel 
1	The hotel is located on Renmin Street, and I feel satisfied in all aspects, but there should be more and better choices at the same price in Changchun, and the hotel price is not high. 
0	The driver installation is troublesome. XP was always unsuccessful when installing the sound card driver. Later I found out that there was no patch for the HD sound card. I was depressed for a long time! Ha ha 
0	If the battery is not installed, there will be a lot of resonance in the rotation of the disc, mainly because the battery position is set on the right hand rest. Others have not been found temporarily. The drivers are also complete. The card reader can only read SD cards. Although SD cards are common, It's still not enough. 
0	Disadvantages: 1. Small hotel, it is estimated that only a few floors are rented for hotel use. 2. The room is very noisy, by the side of the road. 3. The service is not good. 
0	"Have to comment (the local government receives the hotel, it is really a strong sense of officials): 1. Regarding breakfast: This time I checked in on January 28, 2008, and left on February 1, one hour after having breakfast on the morning of January 30 I started to have diarrhea and was accompanied by vomiting (according to the doctor’s instructions, it was food poisoning). I didn’t pay much attention to it in the morning. I took some medicines I brought with me, but it didn’t work. The diarrhea became worse and worse that night. I was sleeping, and I felt cold all over while lying in bed. Secondly, I found a doctor to prescribe the medicine and finally got better on February 1st; 1> In view of this situation, I contacted the hotel to help me buy medicine, the hotel actually asked me Think of a solution by yourself (Later, I contacted the chief mate at the front desk to communicate the situation many times before reluctantly agreeing to help go out and see the medicine I said ""Huanglian Su Tablets"", but the answer to me was that there was no such medicine in the pharmacy; in fact, he answered me Very surprised, because this medicine can be said to be available in every pharmacy, large and small, so I can judge that he did not go out and ask-what is such a hotel??); 2>This situation has happened before living here , But it’s not serious this time, and I’m not sure so I didn’t care; 3>According to the situation of staying in the hotel many times before, combined with this time I can be sure that this is a problem with the hotel’s food hygiene. For a four-star hotel, I don’t think so Any reasons and excuses that can be explained, I hope to attract attention; Supplement: I hope that the 5-star under construction will be opened to welcome guests as soon as possible. Looking forward to... "
1	I bought one and my dad snatched it to his office. O(∩_∩)O, ready to buy another one for me! Anyone needs to develop the ability to manage themselves and time. In order to control one's life as much as possible and lead a high-quality life. This book not only teaches you how to control your time and life. Many times, it will also be a tool to remind you to cheer you up when you learn to be lazy. Regarding the CD, if you are not a teacher or a manager who needs to train employees, it is not very useful. 
0	Please don't stay at this hotel again, it's not that CTRIP is bad. But this hotel sucks. There are three Marco Polo hotels on one road. Among them, Marco Polo Harbor should be the best, Marco Polo Prince is second, and Marco Polo Hong Kong is the worst. At least it was renovated in the 1990s, which is very poor. The room is small with two beds side by side. The sound insulation is not good. Moreover, there is a construction site behind the hotel, which is under construction all day, which is terribly noisy. When you check in, you hold a dual currency credit card, and the front desk does not ask a question, and you directly use US dollars instead of RMB. Other Hong Kong merchants or hotels will at least ask whether to use US dollars or RMB when using credit cards. Just install B. NND. too poor. I will never live for free! ! ! 
1	The graphics card is good and the LED screen is good overall. Jingdong delivery is very fast. . . It was delivered within 24 hours. 
1	The machine is more practical, and the appearance is good~~very practical! I like it very much. Jingdong Express is very timely and very satisfied. 
1	Since Harry Potter, I have always thought that there is no text that attracts me more than Harry. After I came into contact with Mel’s Twilight series, I became fascinated by this magical world. The love story between vampires and humans is always enduring, and Twilight touched me. When I watched it, I don’t think, But there is a deep feeling in the aftertaste. When I first received the book, I thought, why is it so thick, and when can I read it? But when I am really attracted to this story, I feel that the time with Twilight passes quickly, it’s really great~ 
1	"Ole Umbrella...a world that began to germinate from golden seeds...a paradise reached by the road of sheep...a home to solve childhood dilemmas. Li Xiaoman has a nickname called ""Slow Granny"" because she is much slower than other children in whatever she does. She made a wish and got a champion remote control that could manipulate the world around to fast forward, rewind and pause. So, she started 72 hours full of novel experiences...-I eagerly look forward to a wonderful time reading with my daughter under the wonderful Ole umbrella. "
0	Very general, I live in a room on the first floor, with a wall behind the window, and I only see a pile of garbage between the window and the wall. The soundproofing of the room is not good, the sound of the drinking fountain upstairs can be heard, and the sound of the drinking fountain in the room is louder, and it is impossible to sleep without turning it off. The most overwhelming thing is that after staying for two days and getting up every morning, the first thing I saw was Xiaoqiang climbing by the wall. It was disgusting. The computer in the business center of the hotel is 10 yuan/hour for Internet access, and the web page cannot be opened. In short, the overall impression is not good. I also remind everyone that when dining in a hotel, the meal fee is invoiced separately, not together with the room fee. 
1	The childlike stories and cute pictures attracted not only our one-and-a-half-year-old baby, but also our grown-ups. As soon as the books arrived, my father and I rushed to read all the books, as did my grandparents. Finished one after another. When telling a story to your baby, look carefully at those pictures that are full of innocence, simple and a little clumsy. My baby likes it too. There is also an image card of the animal protagonist in the book. The baby took the card and began to say: This is the tears of the little squirrel, this is the belly button of the little bear. . . . . . 
1	If you are a housewife who has to worry about the old and young, if you are a working woman who lacks skills between work and housework, if you are about to marry or just married but lack confidence in housework, if you are like me People who are inherently bad at tidying up the room and often mess up (regardless of gender), then you can put this book in your shopping cart. Inspired by this book, my mother and I began to tidy up every corner of the room. I am very grateful for it, which has brought changes to my home. Especially for me, it was a miracle that I became comfortable in the pigsty and fell in love with storage and organization. 
1	Eight different stories, eight unspeakable stories, each one reminds people of lost youth and obscure light love. There is nothing vigorous, nothing unforgettable, some are just a light touch of love that almost passed away without a trace. When love has become commonplace, what else do we need for each other? When youth is gone, what can we keep? Youth is like a broken blade, we squeeze it through, we are also broken 
1	I bought it for my wife, it looks beautiful, it is enough for girls, and it looks better than my little black :), with a drive disk, it is also very convenient to change xp, it is more expensive if ddr3 memory is added, and it is enough to use it first. The fever is a bit big! 
0	The book was not put on the bed to read. Take it back and look at it in a hurry. Ah. . . . I just put it in the bathroom, just take a look at my convenience. It's really not practical. But the beauty shots are very beautiful, even my husband looked through it. 
0	More than 500 prices, an economic room, the room is very small, it is difficult to turn around inside, the shower is also poor, the quilt is not clean, the cover is itchy, the room is not ventilated, the air is poor, and the sound insulation effect Very poor, I can hear everything in the next house, and I was awakened by a drunkard knocking on the door in the middle of the night. This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. Don't live there. Many budget hotels in the development zone are better than it it is good!! 
0	Seeing the recommendation is good, I bought it. The baby didn't seem to like it and threw it behind the sofa without even looking. Depressed,,,,,, 
1	Love without suffering will not last long. Yuan Xi and He Shi, the problem of the two of them has never been because of the third party, and the four years passed by will not leave love, but nostalgia for their youth. Yuan Xi and Bu Huaiyu, the love between the two of them is so difficult, sometimes they even hate Yuan Xi's stubbornness and irritate her stubbornness. Obviously he is a man a hundred times better than He Shi, and he is obviously a man who is more suitable for her than He Shi, Bu Huaiyu, a mature man who makes people feel they can rely on. 
0	The service is average, the price is relatively high, the rooms are not satisfactory, smelly and dirty... The worst thing is that the waiters are not trained, have no sense of service at all, and have a bad attitude! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
0	Today, I went to paste the film on my laptop, and suddenly found that there was a problem with the network card. I called Jingdong after-sales service. The reminder told me that I was the first to queue, but I waited for 15 minutes and did not wait. I submitted a repair application online. The information is incomplete, depressed, Jingdong's after-sales service is very disappointing! 
1	We are staying in No. 8 five-star building. Generally speaking, it is okay. The service is still lacking. Check-out is too long. Hotel feedback May 6, 2008: Thank you very much for staying at Jinling Liyang Hotel and checking in through the website. Feel the sharing with us. Our hotel has always been committed to continuously improving the hotel’s software and hardware equipment to provide guests with a good check-in environment and a good check-in experience. We have conducted seminars on your comments and made improvements to a series of services such as check-out. We look forward to seeing you again! 
1	"My friend has received the book today. I did not see the texture of the book. But I believe it will be as warm and beautiful as the book in my hands. Just as solid and solid. I am very satisfied with the whole book buying process. Thank you Dangdang. Thank you for the years with ""The Little Prince"" and the farewell in July. Although it will be a long time, I can feel enough warm and beautiful in my heart because I hold the same copy of ""The Little Prince"". "
1	So far, it is the first hotel I want to go to next time. Whether it is the environment or the service, I can feel the 5-star service. Even though it was the Spring Festival when I went there, some restaurants were closed, but the fast response and in place service of the waiter still made people feel considerate. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, just across the street is the bustling Nanjing Road, and very close to the subway station. The hardware of the hotel is good among the 4 stars, and the service is also very good. It may have been opened for a long time, the room is a bit old, and the price of close to 1000 a night is not free and it is a bit inhumane. Maybe Shanghai's slightly higher-end hotels are like this. Overall it is quite satisfactory, will consider staying next time. 
1	The previous part was enjoyable, especially the days in Xiping Village. Amy's patient and meticulous description can remind people of the time when she was in love. When she touches those memories that have been in dust for many years, her mood becomes sweet. The end of the story is a bit regrettable. I think it ended too suddenly and the ending was too blunt, as if it ended hastily in order to end the novel. I like Amy's style of writing, the language is plain, but it can catch people's hearts at once, and it feels very comfortable to read. 
1	This set of books is really worth reading together with adults and children. From the day I bought it, my 2-year-old 8-month-old little treasure pestered me to talk about it. The first part is finished, and she can tell me every book. And, after going out to the mall, I also know that learning and using are tightly holding my hand. The second episode was also turned over by her two days ago. I finished it in one breath before going to bed. The villain's memory is very good. She remembers what the book says, what people are, and what conversations are. Let Xiaobao be charmed! This set of books is very instructive for adults, and even better for children! 
0	I received it only these two days, and I haven't looked at it carefully yet, and I think it's okay, but I can't find some beauty prescriptions of the author, haha! Keep watching! 
1	The workmanship is very good, the appearance is beautiful, the weight is okay, the XP system is replaced by 2G memory, and the speed is super fast. The heat dissipation is also very good. 
0	The introduction of the hotel does not match the actual situation, does not meet the 3-star standard, the room is not tight, and a credit card guarantee is required. After arriving at the scene, the guests were dissatisfied. In the end, they chose rather the hotel to deduct the room fee, and also chose other hotels in Kashgar, that is, the Central West Asia International Hotel, which was not recommended by Ctrip. The price is similar, but it is a four-star standard. . Moreover, the communication between Ctrip and the hotel is not doing well. It is obvious that the introduction of the hotel is quite different from the actual situation, and the price is 30% higher than the price of the local travel agency, but the hotel still deducts all the rooms we booked. Fee, I also have to consider whether to continue to use Ctrip as my choice. 
0	The service is terrible! Checked in on July 9th, at the 11th store in the evening, call the 1168 switchboard and ask for a wake-up service at 645 the next morning, room number: 2319 (for query and confirmation). I didn't do it!! This is the first time I encountered a long-term business traveler, because there was a meeting at 830 in the morning on the 10th and I stayed at the hotel one day in advance. Fortunately, the bed in this hotel is too hard to sleep well. saved me. Hereby evaluate. 
0	The 1.320G hard disk is divided into a 310G and a 10G, which is depressing enough 2. The width seems to be wider than the general 13.3 widescreen 
0	The standard rooms are larger and the pick-up service is good. The reception desk service is not very good. After checking out and check out, make a local call at the reception desk and inform: 2 Jiao is required! 
1	Good price/performance ratio, good gifts, good heat dissipation of the machine, better than expected, and the whole surface is not hot~ 
0	No shortcomings have been found yet! GHOST is a little slow, “I don’t know if I can change it in the BIOS. But most laptops are like this. 
0	Very disappointed, it’s all pictures, a few words to explain wisdom books and comprehensive books. Children will be distracted after reading it. Picture printing is generally not cheap and not worth it. 
1	N280 is a lot better than N270, but the most important thing is that the battery life is really long. It’s no problem to surf the Internet and watch movies for 7 hours, one word, cool! ! ! 
1	It took a long time to choose between 4535G-722G25Mn and this one. At that time, both were 3999. Finally, I decided to buy this one. It was an Intel platform with better performance, and DDR3 memory is also the future trend. There are multiple built-in cameras, and an extra 100 Beijing coupons are given. 
0	"One word-bad. 4 star charge, 0 star service.... There are children in front of the lobby urinating on the ground-no one cares. Ask the front desk for a paper number, and say no without looking at it! TV cannot be watched ""The TV company is repairing, I don’t know if it’s going to be good on the day"". I have breakfast in the morning...9 am I didn’t even have a place to sit and eat. I stayed for 2 nights but the hotel told Ctrip that I only stayed for one night. Take the order).... Bad bad bad... Bad bad bad... "
1	"I bought it after I saw Nan Huaijin's recommendation. It should still be good. I was surprised that a Korean could actually write such a book. The book cited a large number of classics of Chinese Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist thoughts, and combined these more appropriately with the way of doing business and blending with the philosophy of life. Together, it's amazing! Property is as equal as water, and people are as upright as scales! This book once again explains that the highest state of business is ""seeking righteousness instead of profit."" It's worth reading, the only thing I feel is that the book is a little bit verbose, and there are some repetitions. "
1	The configuration is good, the notebook battery life of the GF130M graphics card is already very good, the C side overheating does not appear, the noise control is good, and the keyboard feels good 
0	The reading value of this book need not be questioned, it is a good book. But the quality of this book sent by Dangdang.com is very poor! By the second day of reading, the binding in the middle was loose, and now, more than a dozen pages have fallen out. It's irritating. I didn't expect Dangdang to have such poor quality books. 
0	What is the world's largest Chinese online store, my! Don't talk about random delivery, customer service attitude is poor, processing speed is slow, and not proactive. Want to worry about consumers? 
0	Be firm in the idea and not buy any books that are hyped next time. What kind of writing is so fascinating that he will not be sick when he pinches it. He wants to be so fascinating. He has long been used by state leaders to firmly believe that he will not buy any books that are hype. I feel that this book is a book of superstitions. , 
1	"After I got the book, it happened to be Sunday, and I read it all day! I think it’s not unreasonable to look at ancient Buddhism and Taoism with modern science, but we still can’t explain it! Is light a particle or a wave? Is there still an invisible and intangible world in our world? ""Did God roll the dice?"" Did Copernicus and Galileo break all kinds of obstacles to the creation of heliocentric theory, causality, we have everything Everything is illusory! We are all dizzy! Ready to read Buddhist scriptures! "
1	The whole book is composed of short and interesting stories. Therefore, it is not limited by continuity, and you can read it whenever you want. Especially if you work a long time in the office or want to escape the office environment mentally, you can secretly read a little story or two. It feels so cool, and colleagues don't know what you are laughing at. However, after reading the whole book, there are only two or three places that can make me laugh, but it is enough~~~~How long can I laugh in the current living environment~~~ Finally, I want to say, This book is suitable for people who are more childlike~~~ 
1	A collection of illustrations created by artists from both sides of the strait, each with a unique style. The font size is large, similar to the text size of elementary school textbooks, and the phonetic version is especially suitable for children in the lower grades of elementary school. Can increase children's interest in reading, and can increase traditional cultural accomplishment. The selection of books is also very good. If there is any regret, it is that the abbreviation is a bit too historical. For middle- and high-grade children who want to truly understand traditional literature, they should read the full version. It is a set of high-quality children's books. Zhejiang Children's Publishing House has always performed very well, which is worthy of recognition! 
0	I have great expectations for this book, but I feel disappointed after reading it. It is just a collection of blog posts. The content has many repetitions, and the specific operability is not strong. It feels like the author was driven out to be famous. 
0	1. It is found that the top button of the keyboard is loose on the floor, 2. The CD-ROM drive is noisy when reading the disk, 3. The volume control shortcut keys seem to not work after XP is installed, I don't know if the driver is not installed properly! 4. The one-key recovery system can't be used, and there is a blurry screen. Some people say that the hard disk interface needs to be modified! 
0	The man has an extramarital affair, and the woman has a red apricot out of the wall. I can’t stand it after reading the upper half. The author wants to express nothing through this book, but this kind of book can easily convey an attitude of unfaithfulness to marriage, making the world think this is normal and fainted. . What and what. Criticize strongly! This kind of book can also be popular, alas, the value orientation of this era is really problematic. 
0	"I will never stay in this hotel again, I have never stayed in such a bad hotel before, it is still five-star! ! ! ! ! Metropark was formerly a Hilton Hotel, and it was renamed later. I stayed a few times when it first opened and it felt okay, but then I went to Nanjing and stayed at Golden Eagle (the room rate is similar to Metropark, after all, they are all five-star ), because Golden Eagle is at Xinjiekou, it is convenient to go shopping and eat, but since Nanjing’s Zhongshan East Road is currently under construction, out-of-town cars cannot enter. If you go to Golden Eagle, you will have to detour Zhujiang Road to get there. District, after booking Metropark, you can park the car at the Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway. After this experience, I would rather drive more cars to Golden Eagle in the future. 1. At the time of booking, it was requested to ""make sure to arrange a double room"". Ctrip also responded to the confirmation by SMS, but when I arrived at the front desk, I asked about a twin room. I also asked the front desk that it was not necessary to arrange a double room. ? ! The front desk replied: ""We didn't confirm it like this when we confirmed, and now there is no double bed room."" Forget it, it's important to do business, just move in. I don't bother to talk to her and call Ctrip to ask how it was It's up. 2. In the evening, my friend called to find me. The switchboard said that the guest name in the room was wrong and could not be transferred. My friend thought I had said the wrong room number. He called and asked me. I said the room number was correct. He called again and said The guest's name was wrong and could not be transferred. After four or five calls, the switchboard turned the call! ! ! ! ! ! 3. During the stay, I drank a bottle of Coke and a bottle of Sprite. It was 34.50 when it was carried forward. This is a black shop, but there is no way. People clearly marked the price and wrote it on the paper. I can only blame myself for not having eyesight! ! ! 4. Everything is done, I went to drive home, and arrived at the parking lot (it is open air, just 30 or 40 meters from the hotel entrance), 20 yuan! ! ! Ask the toll collector that the free parking area on the parking ticket has been stamped by the front desk, do you still need to collect money? ! It turns out that you have to pay 20 yuan if you spend the night (the entire side of the parking ticket is densely written on the back of the parking ticket, and the toll collector told me, I didn’t bother to read it), it’s really strange. Live a fart? ! It is not unusual for a five-star hotel to charge for broadband, but it is the first time that I have to pay for accommodation and parking! ! ! ! In short, I will not stay at Metropark again in the future. Golden Eagle, Jinling, Sheraton, and even the four-star Central Hotel are better than Metropark in terms of hardware or service. Supplementary comment on January 24, 2008: The only thing that satisfies me is the doorman at the door. When I went out to eat, he kindly helped me call a taxi and explained to me that it was off work and it was a taxi. Take over, please wait a moment! ! ! Hotel feedback April 14, 2008: Thank you very much for your feedback to our hotel. Regarding hotel parking charges, we will give Ctrip customers special discounts. Customers who book and stay at the hotel can use the hotel parking card to cover the front desk. Take the free parking badge, you can directly enjoy the free parking service. Thank you! "
1	Hara Yanzai developed the whole book through MUJI and some design exhibition designs, and then analyzed the current trend of Japanese design. Before reading this book, I think Chinese designers are following the old road that Japanese designers have taken. I can understand the future direction of Chinese design. For design, I am a layman, but I usually like to see (not appreciate, because of insufficient ability) creative design. This book is for both in the field of design, or like me People who don't understand design should have enlightenment. 
0	When installing the system, although it was changed as everyone said, but the blue screen was still a lot of trouble! ~~ In addition, the heat dissipation is really not very good, although a radiator is provided, the effect is not obvious; the manual is not detailed on the instructions , There is no information on the Internet, only to find out by oneself; 
1	The six-story house that I lived in was not particularly good at first, but the room was good when I moved to the 10th floor. The size is right, although the price is more expensive, but 4 stars is still OK. 
0	After receiving the freight forwarder, I took a look. The printing of the book pages is still quite clear. The cover and the pictures on the Internet are the same. But when I opened it for the second time, the cover was opened and the edges were folded without breaking, but the cracks in the crease were obvious. The quality of the cover paper was too bad. Because I wanted to give it away, I wrote a few words on the paper inside. Unexpectedly, it was overcast. -! I bought a lot of books on Dangdang, the price is really affordable, but the quality is, alas, is it cheap but not good? 
0	One night, if you can kill 12 mountain mosquitoes, for the first time in your life. And the electric mosquito coil provided by the hotel cannot be used. The consequence is that the room is very scary because the customer hits the mosquitoes on the wall with blood stains. 
0	The pre-installed ** system is too complicated, not suitable for home use, and the price is a bit high. In addition, it is perfect! ! ! Ha ha! 
0	A very broken hotel is similar to a guest house, and there are problems with the service. Find more money and give her back. I don’t even say thank you. I don’t even eat breakfast. No one came to pick up the tableware and fainted after the room was delivered. A braised beef is full of lymph and I dare not eat it, and it costs 48 yuan. Only the network speed can reach 2M soon, but it is recommended not to stay too bad. 
0	I don't like his article, it's meaningless, I regret buying it. When he wrote the paragraph with Zhang Ailing, he quite knows how to avoid the important and ignore it, hypocritical. 
0	The book was ordered on June 14th, but it has not been delivered until today! The delivery staff called at noon last Friday to say that it will be delivered immediately, and on this Tuesday, they said that they will be delivered on Wednesday; except for the above two calls Besides, no one saw it. I was in Shenzhen. Normally, I should receive the goods within a week. It has been half a month now and there is nothing. This service is too problematic. 
1	Generally speaking, it feels good for Xiamen Hotel. We booked a double bed room (15th floor) and a twin room (11th floor) in Building 8 for a total of 6 nights. The room is relatively spacious with a little hardware facility It is outdated. For example, the light switch control feels not very convenient and intelligent, and other aspects are good. The waiters are polite, well-trained, and warm and enthusiastic. The breakfast variety is quite rich. I personally like the noodle paste. Duck meat porridge. The milk and soy milk tasted weak when I first went, and it improved significantly after giving comments. The Chinese food on the 3rd floor was done very well, and the private room service was very good. We were a very young waiter that day, but very attentive Thoughtful and appropriate. The surrounding environment is very good. Building 3 is the Thai consulate. The transportation is convenient, and the taxi to the ferry is 8 yuan + 1 yuan fuel. In short, I feel that the hotel is better than the service and environment. In contrast, the 6 to Lujiang Hotel I have used two meals on the floor, which may be due to the good business.Some waiters are very impatient and stiff, which makes people feel very uncomfortable, although the snacks are well done. 
0	I asked for the room to be quiet when booking, but still gave me a room close to the road and hung up the phone to my request. I was very disappointed with this four-star hotel that claims to have no winter. It was also booked on Ctrip. For the Wuhan hotel, I just asked for a higher floor, and the hotel couldn't meet my requirements. Ctrip took the initiative to contact me and explained to me that I was happy to accept it. So the environment is not the main thing, the service is the king! 
0	I don’t know why, as long as it is not a machine with a pre-installed system, it is extremely difficult to install the system and the driver for the HP notebook. It is to upgrade the BIOS and download the driver from an unknown place. The driver download on the HP website is useless! I really don’t understand how such a big company makes its products so complicated! ! ! ! 
1	"The relationship between the two is not deep, and there is no mutual vow, but it is to give people a comfortable feeling. Their childhood sweethearts and two little wives, their pure feelings contain dedication and protection to something. Alas, such a simple feeling can only be found in novels! ! ! ! Every girl has a ""Xi Yu"" deep in her heart. Seeing her is like seeing a fragile shadow, but she can't find Nianxiang who is a sincere person who tolerates, understands, protects, and cherishes herself. The reality is cruel. . This book really allows me to find the purest love in people's hearts! "
0	Personally think that Ctrip recommends this hotel because it does not pay attention to the basic interests of members. Half of the hotel’s rooms are facing the main road, which is very noisy at night, making it impossible to sleep. For each booking, the hotel always claims that it cannot guarantee a quiet room with broadband, and obviously does not value Ctrip's guests. I have gone through many terrible booking processes at this hotel. Ctrip’s coordination ability has always disappointed the guests. I hope that Ctrip will truly consider the interests of its members while making money. Do not recommend such a hotel with rigid services. I will never Check into the hotel. 
0	After installing the XP system, the network card driver is installed and the gateway can be pinged, but the Internet cannot be accessed. After repeated installation, it is determined that the driver is a problem. The driver provided is too bad, and there are problems under the Tongfang website. What's more uncomfortable is that this model of machine is hard to find elsewhere, let alone download other drivers 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
1	The performance is very good! The configuration is good! It comes with its own system and can be used at boot. VIST is easier to use than the legendary. Delivery is fast! Order at 14:00 on the same day and arrive at 11 am the next day! 
1	The waiters are very attentive. The cooperation between Ctrip and the hotel should be very good. Fruits are delivered, and 2 pieces of clothes can be washed and ironed for free. The speed is very fast. When we went there was a meeting. It is estimated that a lot of rooms are occupied and there is no corresponding room , The hotel upgrades us for free and stays in a business room. But the hotel is a bit old, it's time to renovate it. There are no shopping malls around. I want to go for a walk after dinner at night. The surrounding area is full of tobacco and alcohol. No wonder the air in Zhengzhou is so bad... The rest is good. Quite satisfied. 
1	Not bad, the room is big enough, because I have brought the children, I ordered the TWIN BED room, and said that the 3rd and 5th floors are not required. When I went there, there were no rooms on other floors. The front desk took the initiative to arrange a double room and added a bed for free , The attitude is very good. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the display color is bright, the sound effect is good, and the quality is light. It is a very suitable book for girls. 
0	The rooms are weird, the environment is average, the toilets are super-large, the beds are super-small, and the price is high. There is a service charge for delivery. 
0	The memory is a bit small, so I changed to XP directly, and I feel that the shell is a bit loose. But the matte feels pretty good. 
1	Finally adjusted to the new wing, which is their newly decorated floor. Not bad, the bathroom is large, and the breakfast is rich, but quite expensive :) 
1	After experiencing the treatment of Tangkou Hotel and Xihai Hotel, Guomai is undoubtedly a surprise. The rooms are spacious and clean, at least they can guarantee a good night's sleep. In other cities, Guomai may not be enough for four-star, but if Xihai Hotel and others can be counted as four-star, Guomai is really cost-effective. The location is good and the price is cheap. It is the most satisfactory hotel on this trip to Huangshan. 
1	The performance is good, the operation is very smooth, the appearance is simple and generous, the screen is super good, the hp screen is very good, better than the ibm I have used 
0	It is clearly included in the order. Why are other books already received? Why is there no one? ? ? Why? ? ? 
0	Serious misnomer, the so-called quasi-four-star gap is too big. Staying in the deluxe double room, the room is small with only one bed, and the shower space in the bathroom is small and you can't even turn around. The soundproofing of the house is too poor, the voices of the two people next door are clear, and the voice of the waiter in the corridor can be heard from a distance. The restaurant is running wild, where is the mood to eat? This is not a hotel at all, it feels like a KTV remodeling, no, no, too bad! 
0	Lenovo has too many pre-installed software, which is quite irritable. Playing a Warcraft, the widescreen characters are deformed, and the F1 key can't be used. I don't know what is occupied. 
1	"I was recommended to read this book by my elder brother. I will feel it when I read every key word. I will chew slowly and have a full flavor and benefit a lot. The overall framework of the book starts with ""human rights"", which is unique and naturally reflects the value priority as a citizen's rights. The book generally runs through the spirit of liberalism. There are many points of view that can agree with it, and it can also experience the power of political scholars Heart, quite inspired. The author is a professor at Nanjing University. From a glance, I can see that the academic atmosphere there should be full of vitality, but it is really desirable! "
1	There is a one-way street at the entrance of the hotel, which is a bit inconvenient to go out! Other okay 
1	How do I feel that the workmanship is good and the heat dissipation is also good? ? ? ? Is it troublesome to install the system? Set the hard disk parameters in the BIOS, just find an XP and install it. The driver downloads a system update. After the installation is complete, the driver is automatically downloaded and installed automatically. What's the trouble? I wonder if you people will use it or not? 
1	In fact, I also think that classmate Xiaoli should be aware of Xieyi’s revenge, at least he was aware of it, but he may think that he owes Xieyi a lot, and at the same time, in order to give each other a chance to clear up each other’s grievances in the past, it is probably also to find one. The future starts again, so he chooses to be freehand. But when the truth came, I thought it was impossible not to hurt my heart. And I always think that Ayan's broken leg, his pain is torturing himself, transferring the pain in his heart to the pain in his body, at least this will make him feel less guilty of freehand brushwork. 
0	After I received the goods, I watched a few discs seriously, which were much worse than I expected. There are many snowflakes on the screen, which has a great impact on my eyes. 
0	The feeling of staying in is as follows, for reference. 1. Very close to the airport, no car transfer, about eight minutes on foot. It is difficult to walk at night and on rainy days. 2. Not to mention service, all self-help. 3. The bath towels in the room are old and do not feel clean. 4. The indoor swimming pool may have never been open, and it may be fooled. 5. The food in the restaurant on the first floor tastes okay. 6. If possible, it is best not to live. 
0	When playing CS, I have a bit of a card, see the high-definition CPU occupancy rate of 40%, the memory 1G is a bit small, you need to add it yourself, without the burning software! 
1	1. The configuration is good, the price is acceptable 2. The heat dissipation is good, the temperature of the machine is not much after more than ten hours, the CPU is 55 degrees, the hard disk is 49 degrees 3. The small keyboard is more convenient 4. The sound of the machine is lighter, and there is no obvious fan sound 5. The screen is very good, the notebook is relatively large, it is cool to play games and watch videos, and the sound is also good 
0	There are only three usb interfaces, and it feels that they are sometimes not enough. 
0	I bought 6 sets. One of the keyboard and mouse exploded. The new machine was bought. The keyboard and mouse broke the next day. During the exchange, the others have not found any major problems. Oh, it’s still hot. 
0	The binding of the book is very bad. The pages start to fall as soon as you open it. From a literary point of view, Hu is very literary, starting from emotions 
0	It is troublesome to install the system. At least you must tell the specific method. For example, you need to change the IDE option of the hard disk in the BIOS. Non-professional people can't think of it. In addition, the recorder vibrates very much when reading the disk. 
0	The memory is too small, and Vista will definitely not run. You need to add memory. After changing to XP, the memory is basically enough, and you can buy it after the price of the memory falls behind. The housing is mirror-finished, but if it is not easy to use, it can easily become a fingerprint collector. The display is also mirror-finished, which is not good for the eyes 
1	The hotel is located at the most lively Dongjiekou in Fuzhou. It is very convenient to eat, shop and go shopping. The business single room is spacious enough and equipped with LCD computer, which is very convenient. Especially worth mentioning is the hotel's service, which is great! Every night, there are small snacks sent by the waiter on the floor, warm reminders of tomorrow’s weather, and newspapers of the day. It feels very intimate. I will choose this one next time I come to Fuzhou. It’s worth it even for such a caring service. 
1	I just received it at noon today, it looks okay and the performance is good. Added 1G memory, installed XP, the running speed is quite fast, so far, it seems quite satisfactory! 
1	Compared with many netbooks, Lenovo's keyboard frame is too wide, resulting in a small keyboard, HP's frame does not have, but it is too expensive! Money is limited. As for Asus and Acer, the price is not high. Asus is generally expensive, Acer is okay, and the materials used are poor. 
0	It’s too heavy, girls really don’t think about it; the keyboard is a little floating; the touch key on the right is a bit tasteless; 
0	I installed XP for the first time, but the keyboard didn’t work. The model was finally fixed by me. Also, after seeing the mouse that I sent, my colleague said it was fake. 
1	The price is cheap. This style. I have bought it many times. Occasionally there is a broken machine. I have no objection. But your exchange response time is really too slow. Order number 5457723, 
1	The metal shell looks relatively high-end. It is easy to carry, and bigger bags can be installed. There is also a genuine system disk, and I immediately feel more relieved. 
1	Good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good 
0	I haven't seen her lecture, so I bought her book and read it, but I was disappointed. I really can't think of why so many people would pursue this book. Too simple and lacking in depth. On the other hand, it also reflects the strangeness of our public to traditional classics. 
1	Lightweight, large keyboard, battery can last about 5 hours, just because of its battery life, free inner bag 
1	After updating the system to XP, it is still good to use. There is Lingtu 2008 navigation software! You can send the registration card back to Lingtu Company to upgrade to the latest Skywalker 9 version for free. 
1	Generally speaking, this book is not bad, but the content seems to be a little bit less. Reading the entire book is a central idea. There are many contents in Chinese medicine. People who have no basis in Chinese medicine like us can't operate and dare not operate; of course, Some simple operations can be done. For example, I press my feet every night to stimulate the eye position. The main reason is that my couple is myopic. The child’s eyelids have a small white spot a few days ago, so I pressed it for two nights. , No more, I don’t know if it’s the reason for pressing it, I hope so, it’s good to see! 
0	The hotel facilities are outdated, the waiters are stiff, and the location is relatively remote. 
1	"Since the first time, they have held the same view that ""time will polish everything, especially love."" I never thought that love would still be so enthusiastic in five or six years, but until I read this book and saw the comments of netizens,"" Don’t think that time can consume love. Love can withstand the waste of time. If you can’t stand it, that’s not love.” Suddenly, I understood what there is love. In fact, no matter how lonely, it is not true loneliness. In love, still lonely, then you need to think about it, is it true love? "
1	Checked in on July 10th, because the hotel is engaged in activities, so the original 700 room is only 498 yuan. It is quite cost-effective. The location is good. The room is also good. However, if the original price is more than 700, it is a bit expensive. Overall still satisfied of. 
0	"First of all, I am very grateful for the benefits that ""seeking a doctor is worse than seeking self"" for me, my family and friends around me. In the increasingly fast-paced life, everyone forgets that they are a life, a life that can be violated at any time. I think my friends who have read this book must be suddenly enlightened. It turns out that we are so despising our health. So I suggest friends to read this book, I believe it will bring you the same big gains as mine. It is this book that made me understand that having a body without trouble is the basis for all dreams. Health is with you and me, ""seeking a doctor is worse than seeking yourself"" with health "
0	The price is reduced too fast~ I had to wait a few more days if I found it earlier, and it dropped by 500 in just one month. Now I also send a wireless router. Cry~~~ 
1	Hong Kong hasn't made a trip yet. I have read it for the second time. I feel that Japanese things really pay attention to details. Therefore, the book is translated. When the book describes things related to Japan, there is an inexplicable sense of superiority, such as Japan. Family hotels run by people feel a bit weird, but fortunately there is very little space. After reading the map of Hong Kong, it feels a bit clear to my chest. I really want to go to practice when it is full. It is suitable for friends who visit for the first time, but the book is a version from 2006 to 2007, and there may be a gap in reality. Right! I'll tell you when I get back. 
0	It is a flashy work of the time, with a strong commercial atmosphere and limited medical standards. Just flip over, don't take it too seriously. It is better to have no books than nothing. 
1	The small book is relatively reasonable, catching up with the special price, I feel comfortable! ! JD shopping is quite enjoyable! 
0	The room is clean, but it can't move after the extra bed. The facilities have a two-star level, which is pretty good on the mountain. The room is only equipped with two down jackets. Children with extra beds must be able to withstand the cold. The front desk cannot discuss it. 260 yuan/day is just the extra bed fee, excluding down jackets. The restaurant is definitely a five-star price and two-star service. 
0	This is almost the best hotel in Jiangyin, and many foreigners live here. The size of the room is okay, the decoration and facilities don't feel like a five-star standard, it's about the same as a four-star. The most unbearable thing is the parking lot of this hotel. I went there on an ordinary day, and it turned out that someone got married in a hotel. The underground and the ground were full of cars of people attending wedding banquets. As a result, the people who stayed in our store had to park their cars far away across the road. It was still raining that day. There was a Frenchman, a Filipino, and two Chinese in my car who had to carry their luggage and braved the rain to escape one puddle after another to the hotel lobby. The security guard at the door seemed to have taken no surprises at this situation, and looked blankly at the four of us jumping around. It sucks. 
1	I stayed at this hotel for the first time, and the overall feeling was good. The waiters were greeted with smiles, and the service was attentive. The rooms were clean and warm. The deluxe room was also equipped with an LCD computer for free internet access, and the internet speed was very fast. Next time I go to Shenzhen, I will stay at this hotel. Hotel feedback August 5, 2008: Dear guests, hello! First of all, thank you very much for your praise of our shop. At the same time, I am very happy to inform you that the network fiber of our shop has been upgraded from the original 2M to 5M, which greatly improves the network speed, making it more convenient and faster for business office or Internet surfing. Continuously improve service levels and provide guests with better service is our aim! We sincerely welcome you to visit again! 
1	Not currently used. I didn’t find a bit, it looks correct. The first time I bought something from this store, the shipment was very timely, and no quality problems were found. I was buying a wireless router and used it to talk about my feelings. 
1	After all, you get what you pay for! I can't demand too much at this price! I use it well! It’s just a bit troublesome to install XP, just re-zone and format it to install it! 
1	Due to the location, it is not easy to get a taxi at some time. Of course, this is not the hotel's fault. 
1	It is said to be one of the most expensive hotels in Qingdao. The rooms are very warm, but the bathroom seems a bit old. Everything else is fine. 
0	The surrounding environment is very quiet, not far from Tianmen Mountain and the airport, and the pick-up service is also very convenient. It is very inconvenient to walk around, and it is far from the downtown area. The rooms are relatively small, dirty and old, and the sheets are not very clean. The metal under the cold kettle has fallen off and is moldy. I dare not use it. Even the cold water has precipitated impurities. I did not dare to drink. The shower room is prone to leaking and the floor becomes very wet. Breakfast is not very good. Not good. It feels a bit fooled to see the overall score. 
0	I don't understand why so many people are chasing this book. I was also influenced by the thoughts of Chongzhong. I bought a lot of books in one breath to read for myself and to give away friends. But when I watched it halfway, I couldn't stand it anymore. The whole book is a hodgepodge of patchwork, from various health books that are now popular, or some so-called beauty books copied from somewhere, plus the author's hard work to show off his so-called happiness, it is not readable. Of course, the author is still very smart, knowing what is the selling point, knowing the psychology of women who are already old and about to be old. Maybe it’s not written by a 31-year-old beauty at all, maybe it’s the work of a sloppy, shabby man editor. 
0	The sunny deluxe executive room booked was actually much smaller than the deluxe room booked by my colleague. If I didn't happen to visit my colleague, I would let the wine pass. The price difference between the two types of rooms is ￥150, and the expensive room is much smaller in size-not even as big as the standard room, and there is no change in other facilities! This kind of disguised cut-off approach is a fraud to consumers! There is no staff on duty on the executive floor of the hotel, nor any special services for executive guests: no executive lounge, no Happyhour, no dedicated service. 
0	The hotel is average and the facilities are okay, except that there may be some bugs on the bed. I feel itchy in the morning. The colleagues who live with me also feel the same way. I dare not live anymore. 
1	The order placed at 2 am today was received at 3 pm. It’s really fast. I wanted to inspect the goods beforehand and swipe the card. Hehe, but the deliveryman didn’t let it go, but I understood that I went home and opened it. The customer service made 2 calls and asked about the backup and driver installation problems. The customer is very good. The email is sent to my mailbox. There are various xp driver information and precautions. 
0	My family stayed on June 7th and Out on the 8th. I was very dissatisfied with the full glass shower room and the movements of the people inside. It was clear that I had to walk out of the sink after taking a shower and put on clothes. There are more than ten children The age is embarrassing, and the toilets are extremely small. The most infuriating hotel is a five-star hotel. The five-star fee but the product brand is far below the standard (referring to sanitary ware, faucet, hardware) . Special reminder to the residents of the room on the parking lot, remember to draw the curtains when you go to the toilet, don't think it is from reflective glass, your beauty inside is really heart-pounding! ! ! 
1	Cheap and powerful. Go to Zhongguancun to get 3,600 tickets, this time only 3,299 tickets. Cheap enough 
1	Traveled to Henan on National Day and stayed at Zhengzhou International Trade Center for two nights. The location is in the southwest of Zhengzhou, so travel is fairly convenient. The room is larger and the equipment is relatively complete. The TV is so old-fashioned, sorry for the five-star price. The hotel is also composed of two buildings side by side. The arranged room is facing the building next door. There is nothing outside the window, which is really uncomfortable. The waiters are very good, let us feel the enthusiasm of Henan. The parking lot is large and convenient. 
0	The visual effect of the screen is not good. It is not as refreshing and bright as before. It is said that it is energy-saving, but it is actually torturing the eyes and feels fooled. This time Jingdong’s distribution is simply better than the snail. It is extremely procrastinated. The order and request to cancel the order has been issued many times, but there is no response. The money is already in the bag, and the return request is ignored. 
0	The translation is not very good, a bit convoluted, and there are some points to learn from, but considering that the status of Korean women is different from that in China, the angle of this book is not suitable for me. 
1	"From the perspective of ancient Chinese, this book analyzes the origin and cause of ""being"" in detail. It is a longitudinal study, in other words, a good book worthy of reference for the study of current linguistics. But for some reason, the cover of this book was very dirty when it was sent to my hand, a lot of soil and a lot of abrasion. Fortunately, for the hard-bound version, I had to throw the cover away, hoping to send it out after the next inspection. In addition, when I bought the book, the title of the book was ""Study on the Origin and Causes of the Chinese Word ""Shi"""". I was a little surprised to know that it was all in Traditional Chinese when I bought it. "
1	The location of the hotel is very good, at the corner of West Street. The hotel has a beautiful environment, but the buffet breakfast is too expensive and there are not many varieties. Stayed for 3 days in July and it feels good. 
0	A screw was small, and the memory was supposed to be installed on site. The staff member said that installing the memory would have to lose the bar code (he said that there was a screw under the bar code), so he didn’t install it for me. I came back to read the manual. No screws are fooled, a bit unhappy 
0	The place is remote, and the concierge is not serviced at all. When I went to live a few days ago, the air conditioning was not available. The hotel excused that it had been turned on, but there was no sound of it. In order to save money, it was an exaggeration. I will definitely not stay in this shop next time. 
0	I also decided to buy this book after reading all the reviews. Some of the reviews were very positive. Not many people said how good this book is. I think this book is not popular enough. The content method in the book It is only suitable for short-term use by a small number of people, not long-term use. So friends who read the book, you must consider your personal physique before using the methods in the book. I always think this book has a very high commercial nature. 
0	In the aggerssive book, the body and back of the aggresive book have this kind of error. Please give the reader a reasonable explanation and correct this error! This is also a business reputation issue! 
0	I thought that the best room is that the carpet is clean. The room is quiet, soap and shower cap are available. Unfortunately, after I checked in, I found that the carpet was terribly dirty and had an unpleasant smell. I didn't know what machines in the room creaked and made it impossible to sleep. The feather box in the bathroom was empty! ! ! ! Too scary! ! ! This is the case for the most advanced rooms, so how can the standard rooms live? ? ! ! ! By the way, there is breakfast! ! The coffee is cold! ! ! The weather is the same as Qiqihar! ! ! 
0	The appearance of the hotel looks good, but the items in the room are too old. The Simmons bed turned out to be uneven. As soon as you lay down, people would roll to the side. After calling the housekeeping department, a waiter came soon. I didn’t look at the situation very much, so I did the action skillfully: Throw the quilt, pillows, sheets, etc. on the luggage table, then turn the Simmons bed over, and finally spread the sheets. The whole action is very consistent, really. In one go, it can be seen that the waiters have done the same thing a lot. The large bath towels in the bathroom are worn out very, very thin, and they will not be used by guests in other hotels for a long time. Slippers like paper will not last long, and there are no combs. TV channels are also very few, so don't think about HBO or anything. The advantage is that the transportation near the hotel is very convenient, many buses have stops, and there are many restaurants nearby, so eating is not a problem. 
0	Poor service! ! ! The attitude of the waiter is very bad! The environment is also average 
0	The battery is 4-cell, tasteless, not a 9-cell battery. The 6-cell battery should be regarded as the standard configuration. It is not kind 
1	Do you know where the network cable interface is? It is more hidden than the tunnel entrance of Gaojiazhuang. Behind the bedside table! Don't think about it? It depends on how you use it. 1: Bring your own network cable above 4 meters; 2: Bring your own small bench: 3: The trash can in the room can be turned over to sit... 
0	"I booked a single room with a double bed for 400 yuan a day through Ctrip. The price/performance ratio is very poor. Yinchuan Youxiangyu and Baiyue seem to look good. Why doesn't Ctrip? ? 1: Hotel facilities are too old. The carpet is also very dirty, not worthy of the four stars and its price. 2: The water in the bathroom shower is very slow, and it will be flooded. I live in room 2702. After the central air-conditioning in the room is turned off, there is still sound from the axial flow fan, is it caused by the internal valve leakage? I all know why the professional maintenance workers don't know? Haha 3: The toilet flushes when it is pressed down, but it won’t pop up. You have to fix it yourself. I told the hotel that I just fix it once and use the same problem next time! ! ! ! ! ! Speechless! ! ! ! ! 4: Except for maintenance workers and service personnel, they are also quite satisfied. The MM of the IT department is very good. My ""little black"" has a system problem and a black screen. She hit the nail on the head and helped me find the problem, provided a repair plan, and offered praise. And the taxi from the western restaurant that GG booked me to Lingwu was very good and praised again! "
0	This is the worst hotel I have booked through Ctrip. The first is that the corridor carpet is very dirty, and the surface after entering the room is okay, but the quality is very poor: the room does not have a network cable, after calling the service desk twice, a waiter came and sent a network cable and left, but the result was not It was easy to use, and then called again. A male waiter came and checked and checked, and finally determined that there was a problem with the room’s incoming line, and then asked and changed the room. The network in this room is good, and then I found the water heater in this room. It was bad, the waiter only changed one after calling three times. There is a charge for two small bags of tea in the room, and there is a charge for drinking water, there is nothing that is free of charge. I want to charge everything. It is strongly recommended that Ctrip cancel the reservation of this hotel with Ctrip in order to harm others. 
0	The fly in the ointment is: the quality of the gift-the bag is a bit problematic, but Jingdong does not allow it to be replaced, which makes people feel a bit regretful~~ 
0	It's far worse than expected, and there is nothing to move. The language is plain and the characters are pale. In short, I can't understand those who say this book is moving. 
0	The environment is average, the facilities are old, the deluxe standard rooms are not as luxurious, the bathroom is slippery, and I almost sprained my feet. I will not live here anymore 
0	It's not as interesting as I expected.Maybe for the child, it is much more suitable.In fact, there are not a lot of useful tips in the book.A lot of mistakes listed by the writer is related with wrong spelling.To me,it's not really funny. 
0	1. There is only one memory slot, you can only change it if you want to add memory. Almost bought an extra 1G. 2. Built-in sim card slot, 3G module cannot be used, no installation. 3. The packaging is still not good. The machine that came has been unpacked. 
1	For a small holiday on May 1, staying at Huzhou International Hotel, I feel good, and the price/performance ratio is quite high, especially in the most lively shopping area in Huzhou, you can enjoy the festive way of the citizens during the May Day holiday in a small city, or you can choose calmly Huzhou’s specialty silk and brushes, because the specialty store is next door to the hotel. I often visit the green mountains and green waters. This time I came for pure shopping, which is not interesting. The service of the hotel is also good. Next time there is a need will stay. 
0	I have never stayed in such a bad 2-star hotel: the white bed lamp shade is moldy and black. The bathtub was so rusty that there were 5 spots, just like the giant spider that I saw on Weizhou Island this time lying there. (My son didn't dare to stand inside and take a bath) The entire sink was marked by cracks repaired by cement... The 2-star hotel in Beihai is also very well rated! ! ! Except for the satisfaction of the service staff in the entire hotel, no part of the hardware can be said to be a 2-star hotel. It can be said that it is not as good as a newly built guest house. Throughout the trip to Beihai, this hotel gave us a great regret, hey! If I hadn't procrastinated and booked the hotel by the sea in advance, I wouldn't have made the entire seaside hotel full, and I would have stayed in this hotel at zero hour. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good. Walking out is by the Songhua River. If you live in a room near the river, you will have a chance to see the rime by opening the window early. The transportation is also more convenient, and taking a taxi from the train station is just to skip the meter. The hotel's facilities are not old, and it feels like an old three-star hotel has been renovated. The room is relatively large, but the layout is not very good. The shower head is not big enough and always looks like there is not enough water. 
1	The order placed on Saturday, arrived on Monday, I am very satisfied with this notebook, and thank Jingdong, come again next time. Thanks to one of the male operators for helping me inquire about the delivery status and calling me to reply 
1	The configuration is relatively high, the workmanship is good, the sound is good, and the sound is pleasant, especially when watching large movies. The screen is large, and the resolution is 1680*1050, which is different from the resolution stated above. The heat dissipation is good, and the battery life is good. It has been used for 4 hours when browsing the web and not playing big games, and it has 10% power. give it a like. The price of Jingdong Express 6399 is still worthwhile. 
0	1. Although it is close to Lu Xun’s hometown, the vendors in the hometown are not open at night, and there is no light at night in the hometown; Xianheng Hotel only provides packages, with a three-person package of more than 360 yuan. Shaoxing’s water village scenery no longer exists, so I live here The significance of it is worth weighing again. 2. You can't ask the tricycle driver to help you find the hotel. According to the tricycle driver, help customers get to the inn, and the inn will give the driver a rebate of 20 yuan. 3. The inn cannot provide 24-hour hot water. 4. The room is not clean, the facilities are outdated and the computers placed are in vain and cannot be used at all. 5. The doors and windows are not tightly closed. They belong to the old house, but they are completely different from the renovated hotels in Dali and Lijiang. If you are timid, you must carefully consider it so as not to sleep well. 6. The 24-hour free pick-up and drop-off service promised by the inn is: Pick-up: You need to contact the inn after arriving at the train station or passenger transport center, and plan the waiting time; Delivery: Only after 8:00 in the morning, you have to catch a train or car If you need to make an appointment with the inn in advance; breakfast will not be available until 7:30 
0	Although the hotel and service in Hefei are relatively poor and understandable, I have never seen such a poor service and hotel facilities! It is also four-star, and it is not as good as the small hotel on the street! The quality of the waiter and the lobby manager is extremely low! The room is simply The garbage room was built, and the hotel also said that the room booked through Ctrip is this kind of room, and it is still the worst. Either it is booked at the front desk of the hotel, and the room rate is much better...Halo! Strongly condemn this The approach of the hotel! Resolutely will not stay at the hotel again! There is a post hotel next to the train station. 
1	I think Denmark is worthy of the kingdom of fairy tales. They make these children's literature, the story angle is always very novel, the pictures have tension, and the strong appeal. Our Chinese children, the cuteness of the children who should have been, has been made a little bit by our traditional education methods...let our children become more like children and more adorable. They should have their boundless world to imagine, they have the right to enjoy the whole world 
0	I just thought it was good. Who knew that after buying it back, it was not good at all. The author actually doesn't understand Chinese women, let alone the national conditions... Depressed, any book can be popular these days? 
0	Stayed here many times in the past 18 months. This could be a good place to stay if the hotel would maintain the facilities, but they did not. The last two times I stayed (Feb and March) the shower and TV did not work EVEN after I reported them. Will not stay here from now on! 宾馆反馈 2008年5月16日 ： Thanks your problem , We will chang the shower and Tv ,I will hope you come here again 
0	It is very troublesome to make the system and cannot install the goss disk. I am lazy. I don’t want to drive, and my enter keyboard key is not working. Also, the USB interface for checking the mouse can’t be used. What should I do? what 
1	The room is big enough, the facilities are average, you can surf the Internet for free, but unfortunately there is no breakfast; the parking lot is large, and the transportation is convenient for self-driving; the downstairs facing the nightclub with super good business, it was noisy until 2 in the morning. The overall feeling: in Shantou, the price is still acceptable. Additional comments October 30, 2007: Stayed twice, the 9th and 6th floors, I feel the same. 
1	The appearance is okay, in fact, it is not as cost-effective as black. Girls like this color, no way, the speed is okay. Alone obviously also deals with general games. HD video is completely fine. It's too heavy. The same as the 14-inch. 
0	The content is very ordinary, I don't think there is anything new. And the understanding in some places should not conform to the original intention. Not a book worth buying 
1	"The book ""History of Modern Arabic Literature"" was written by Mr. Zhong Jikun, a well-known professor in the Department of Arabic at the School of Foreign Languages of Peking University. . The book outlines the development trajectory of Arabic literature, and gives a detailed and pertinent description and insightful commentary on the revival of modern Arabic literature. The language is concise and beautiful, and highly readable. The paper quality is very good, and the layout is also very beautiful. It is very suitable for collections by students majoring in Arabic or studying comparative literature. "
1	Cost-effective, perfect screen, power-on time is only 3 hours, motherboard is GM45, JD data is wrong, and Bluetooth (this is better, eliminating the trouble of disassembling and installing Bluetooth modules), the hard drive is Western Digital, Western Digital feels better than Hitachi, The Hitachi disk used in the previous 49 series has a click sound every time it is started, and Western Digital cannot hear it. The memory is modern. 
0	That's how Beijing hotels work! Five-star hotels are at the level of three stars, not to mention four-star hotels. 
1	A large amount of formula data and detailed engineering illustrations are very practical for design and manufacturing, but they are also very professional...Standard textbooks are suitable for firearms enthusiasts above the intermediate level, mainly suitable for the internal structure, operation principle, and component design of firearms Those who are interested in stereotypes...need to have some foundation in engineering. Basic readers and curious ones can basically avoid it, because they can't read it or they can't turn a few pages because they can't read it. However, this kind of book is hard to find in the market, and the price is acceptable, so it is worthwhile to start a book. ! 
1	I bought it for 4499 yuan. The overall performance is relatively balanced, the sound is good, the appearance is beautiful, and the keyboard feels good. I tried to play a few 1080p high-definition movies, and they were all smooth. 
1	The hot water system and the bathroom drainage system are relatively bad. The water is difficult to adjust. It is either too cold or too hot. After a shower, the bathroom is water in the same place. Others are OK, the location is very good, and the relative price is more attractive 
0	"Only because of Lee Ang's movie ""Lust and Caution"", I bought Zhang Ailing's novel to read. After reading it, I felt disappointed—so short and confusing—how could Director Li make the award-winning film? A woman wants to booby and kill a man (traitor), and at the last moment suddenly feels that this man may really love her-he is buying her a diamond ring, but she is going to kill him, it is impossible to justify it, so she is in a hurry Let him go. But the man wouldn't let her go...Lexus almost killed the man, and sexuality (and precept) really killed the woman. I think the essence of the novel probably lies here. There is nothing new about such a theme, but there is something intriguing about the writing. What I admire is actually the title of the novel: Lust, Caution "
1	The room is clean and tidy, and the service is OK. At this price, it is not bad. It is recommended that you book a room with windows, but the restaurant is not good enough. Once the mushrooms were sour, there is no supermarket nearby, which is not convenient. You have to go a long way to buy fruit, 
1	The CPU speed of the machine is very fast, more than 20 web pages are opened, sql server 2008 is on, visual studio2008 is on, the machine is still very fast, nothing to say 
1	After watching it for a while, I turned it over. To master some relevant essence is to face every day actively. It is useless to complain. Instead, it hurts others. . . To change such a bad habit, the practice of a purple bracelet mentioned in the book is good. In fact, sometimes what you think is different from what you do. It would be better if there was an outside supervision. . This book is not for reading, but for practice. If you develop a successful habit, it cannot be measured by money. . . 
1	I remember the first time I went to the county to study when I was in high school. With a passion for books and foreign literature, I searched every large and small bookshelf, and the only one who could find a relatively complete foreign literature was Yanshan, so I was silly at that time. I think that of course the best foreign literature in China is Yanshan Publishing House, and I am full of affection for her. . . Of course, the knowledge at that time is not the same as the current knowledge, but when I read Yanshan's book, I always feel a kind of intimacy like an old friend. . . Of course the quality is good, the translator is also a well-known translator, hardly any quality and content problems have been found, great 
1	The room is relatively comfortable, the hotel service is good, the lobby is bright and clean 
0	My baby is ten months old. He is usually interested in all kinds of colorful books and pictures, but he is completely disinterested in this set of books. I just read the first page and the last back cover and left it aside. I Guess maybe he is not old enough to like cartoon books, so he can only try to read it later. 
0	1. The heat is quite severe; 2. The noise is very loud, especially when watching movies in the dead of night; 3. The hard disk partition is unreasonable; 4. The protruding part of the battery seriously affects the appearance. 
1	The service is very good, the surrounding is very lively, it is very convenient to take a taxi and eat. The room for 330/night is relatively small, but clean and tidy. Although it is a four-star, the overall feeling is still very good. There are a lot of fish in Huaqing Pool. They are very beautiful. You can buy fish food at the front desk to feed them. 
1	The heat dissipation and noise of the machine are at a good level, which is incomparable with Thinkpad, but it is quite good compared to others, and the appearance is of course very good 
0	The memory frequency is low, it is still ddrII 667, the screen is 16:9, not 16:10 looks comfortable 
0	The product itself is a bit scratchy, but it can be tolerated, but the delivery of Jingdong is really annoying. 
1	The room feels average, not very good, but it's not bad. I chose it because it was close to the destination 
1	"Everyone has a childhood, and the contradiction is that everyone may not feel its preciousness when they are in it. When they are older, when they look back, they know that it is really ""you don't have to worry about it! Every child has a beating heart, whether it is a ""good"" child or a ""skin"" child, compared to adults, they are novel, happy and full of energy! No matter what every child, when the parents look back, when they remember, there will be so many mischievous fun things! Let us go back to our childhood together, let us walk into Lindgren's ""Naughty Bag Emil"" and find ourselves! ! "
1	The front desk is not as slow as the legend, it was ok when I went. The overall service is not bad. I went in March and the room was a bit cold, and I was shivering when I took a shower. Internet speed is ok. 
1	The best hotel I can find in Jilin City. The speed of check-in and check-out is okay. The room is in good condition, the bed is not as comfortable as in Changchun, and it feels harder. 
0	1. Vista garbage, just installed, delete the trial software that comes with the machine, it completely crashes, and can not be restored with F11. No recovery disk 2. There is no partition, just a C drive, and important files should be backed up continuously. 3. The details are rough, and the wire ends can be seen wherever the LCD screen is connected. 
0	The interface distribution is not very reasonable, the heat is large, and the temperature of the right palm rest is high. I don't know if everyone has this problem. 
0	The hotel service is not very good, the cafe’s food is very tea (the variety is small, the style is old) The soundproofing effect of the hotel is very bad. The people next to the room on the first day talked as if they were in the room, and they were talking in the corridor after changing rooms I heard very clearly. I had to hide in the bathroom when I called. Anyway, there is no privacy. The hotel facilities are relatively outdated, and it is inconvenient to go out on the side of the expressway. The price of the city is 620NET (not including breakfast), and my friend is through the travel agency 610 (including breakfast), the so-called 500 yuan is only the first day's price, which is very deceptive. 
0	The fuselage is slightly thicker, and there is room for optimization. The mirror paint is too strong for fingerprints. Some components are cheap and seem not detailed 
0	Fingerprints are easy to stick, and it’s a bit heavy. Changing the screen to 12 inches will make it more comfortable. The left half of the keyboard is a bit false, and it will sink when pressed. 
0	I just want to say that this book is a shameless confession of a shameless person. There were people like Hu Lancheng back then, and there are now. Greedy and turbid, selfish and shameless, and even take oneself as an onion. 
1	This is a book that is not easy to read, a book that makes people unhappy. I am studying ecology, and I can understand and accept most of the concepts, but I am not very clear to others. One by one example hurts me a lot. I read it on the train. I read 115 pages in 8 hours. This is very rare for me. I haven't calmed down to read a book in a long time. I feel only heartache. This book is not a literary work, nor a documentary report, but a science, a truly rational science. So I advise those who want to read this book to pay attention, this is not a good novel, but a serious science. 
0	The endless harassing calls in the evening make people really dare not compliment. Additional comment December 14, 2007: I made 1 point, how can I get an average of 2 points? baffling 
1	Very high cost performance, highly recommended, no matter from which way the hardware is not a big problem, it is definitely enough for the average person 
0	The 240 yuan standard room per night set by Ctrip is really poor. 1. The peculiar smell of hotel passages and rooms is particularly strong, and it is a long time to sleep at night. 2. The room facilities are too simple, the water flow in the shower is very small, and the time to take a bath at home is equal to the time to wash your hair in the hotel. There is no hair dryer in the room, and you need to borrow it from the customer service after washing your hair (the customer service said that there are only 2 hair dryers in the hotel, and they have been lent out~) 3. After getting up in the morning, I found that the water in the bathroom was hot water, and the child could not Tolerating hot water simply did not wash. 4. Breakfast generally doesn't matter. The waiter is only responsible for removing the dishes and not changing the tablecloths. The tablecloths are very dirty, which is unappetizing. Changed the hotel immediately the next day. 
0	This is a rather bad hotel. I don’t know how other people commented on it. They have extremely distrustful expressions of customers and work style, self-righteous, arrogant, and wanton deceiving customers. They didn’t put customers in In my eyes, I advise friends who have read this post, don’t live in this black shop! Remember! ! ! 
1	The service is very good, the waiter in the room will pour you a cup of tea, very warm, although the hardware is poor, but the price is very high, next time I go to live in Shanshui 
1	The room is not very big, but the bathroom is very creative. The breakfast is very good, variety, and taste good, and the attitude of the service staff is also very good. 
0	"It's been a long time since I finished reading a book so quickly. Can capture the reader's psychology to write stories, the language is simple and fascinating. It can be a good pastime in the fast-paced life. It happens to be teaching Liu Ji's ""Sellers of Oranges"". Most students don't understand him. Students don't like the solemn and cold introduction of Liu Ji in textbooks. I took advantage of this to borrow from the book, and replaced it with a relaxed language, interspersed with a few short stories, the students were very interested and quickly learned some about Liu Ji. I also recommended this book to students. Thank you ""Those Things in Ming Dynasty"". I want to buy a few more books and read on! "
0	The use time is not long, no shortcomings are found, it is just a bit hot, the screen is not ideal, and the backlight is. 
0	7-in-1 card reader. I guess all consumers think it’s an external one. It’s also a red letter. It’s a bit silly. It’s actually an SD slot on the laptop. Basically all computers have it. 
1	Good performance, good overall! high speed! The appearance is quite satisfactory and the size is moderate. The delivery speed is also super fast. I ordered it yesterday afternoon and received it at noon today. 
1	I saw the comments from netizens saying that it is better not to have rooms on the 3rd and 5th floors, but unfortunately they are still designated as the 3rd floor. Ask the front desk. If you ask, it is still a question of nothing. The room facilities are average, the cold water in the washbasin is super small, only hot water is the big one, which makes my laundry super uncomfortable. The service was ok, the room attendant immediately gave us 3 more bottles of water after tipping. The biggest advantage of the hotel is that it is super close to DFS, big and small bags can be put back in the room and continue to go to other places. 
0	1. The mouse is not included, which is a bit inconvenient; 2. The screen saver and keyboard film are not included; 3. The sound quality is average 
1	"Spring Festival hotel special offer, I immediately refunded ""Home Inn"" and switched to Sheraton. The superior room is only three-star standard, which is too small. After changing to the deluxe room, it looks like a five-star. I don’t know how the five-star room standard is set. Bed Bedding and bedding are the characteristics of ""Sheraton"", down pillows are still so comfortable!! Service, this is a bit inferior, especially the bellman, I don't take over a big bag on my back; the front desk is okay, and the room change is very efficient. For the sake of the special price, don't care about it. If it's normal price, it's not worth it. "
1	The glitz and tales of the past are written wonderfully, and it can be used as a popular book of ancient romance. However, no matter how unique the author's opinions are, he is ultimately biased towards history, too personal, and lacks historical support. For those who like poetry, it is really a very good book. The words are beautiful and elegant, clear and delicate, and they have deep feelings. The tone is mostly sad, narrating the thrilling love in the far past, sad and sad, and using classical poetry to take you into the world of ancients. 
1	Anqing Hotel is really good, it feels very comfortable, but it also has disadvantages. Advantages: 1. Quiet environment. 2. Fruits are available every day, and the air conditioner is turned on before you return to the room. It is very comfortable after entering the room. 3. The room is large and comfortable. Disadvantages: 1. I live on the second floor, the windows cannot be locked, and it is not safe enough 2. There is no elevator. 3. Breakfast is better before 8:30, and there is nothing to eat after 8:30 4. Checkout is slower overall, Still pretty good, next time I go to live 
0	"I thought it was so pretty. Alas, he was really a ""well-intentioned"" author. I posted a lot of wrong English pictures of our Chinese people. I didn't laugh to death, and I was ashamed. Some articles are purely I think they might still be compiled. For example, when I talked about watch aunt, is it possible? ? ? Unless it is deliberate when joking, it is difficult for anyone who has studied English at junior high school or above to make this kind of mistake, right? After reading a few stories, my enthusiasm was greatly affected. I wanted to read it as a joke book, but I didn't expect it to be difficult to laugh. . . "
0	I was so disappointed to go to the blue sea and blue sky during the May Day holiday. In the past, the overall impression of Nandaihe and the blue sea and blue sky was not very good, but at least it was clean and tidy. In addition, there were windsurfing to play, and the impression was always good. This time I specially mobilized a few friends to go there. I didn’t expect that Nandaihe built the road in a comprehensive way and it was very inconvenient to get in and out; secondly, the overall environment of Nandaihe was very dirty and there was dirt everywhere; again, there was not only no change in the blue sea and blue sky, but also Dirter than the outside environment. The price of the room is not low. It is said that it is a sea-view room, but there are only construction sites and gutters at the door. The sanitation in the room is also very bad, and the tap water is yellow. It is suggested that there should be more resort hotels beside Yiwei Road. 
0	Yesterday I put a keyboard film, and I will post a screensaver another day. If these are also delivered together, ha ha Another problem is that when I used it last night, I heard the operation sound of the notebook. The one that my colleague bought with me doesn’t have this problem. It’s not the inside of the machine, right? ? 
0	I checked in on February 27th after the Spring Festival. The hotel is very poor; it is said to be four-star, but the service is not in place at all. I stayed for five days; the waiter entered the room for three days to fold the quilt and make up disposable hotel supplies; the floor was not cleaned; the small confetti I dropped on the first day was not even changed in the lying position on the third day; It's ridiculous! It was noisy at night, and the door opening sound was very loud; it was really bad; I suggest that everyone don't live. 
1	[Recommendation] The most feared thing in life is that there is no guide. I always think that everything is right. I don't know how many detours I have made. When you are upset, opening this book may ease your emotions; when you are confused, opening this book may help you point your confusion and get back to the right path; when you are unhappy, open this book, maybe It can help you regain your confidence and see everything with a brand-new vision... Stop for a while, calm down and read this book, and improve your self-cultivation! 
1	The location is good, in front of the hotel is the trestle bridge. If you are lucky, you can see the sunrise on the TV tower on the trestle bridge. On the opposite road is the bus stop. You can take special line 311 to Beijiushui (departing from the railway station at 6:45, 7:45, and 8:30 in the morning, it is recommended to wait 10 minutes in advance, and the journey takes 1.5 hours). The service is satisfactory and it feels good to have breakfast while watching the sea view. Since it was built in the 20th century, the decoration is general, but the sanitary equipment is a new Kohler. The soundproofing is really not ideal. The sound of the next door can be heard in the middle of the night. It is recommended to send a card to keep quiet at night when guests check in. There are few places to eat in a better environment, but a 10 yuan taxi ride will definitely find a satisfactory restaurant. The small foods in the hotel corridors are children’s favorites, but everyone consciously uses them in moderation! 
0	The original note is in English, why can't you leave it in English? Isn’t it better to have ten words? All in simplified characters, the pictures are not necessarily attractive, they will be given to others 
1	I think it's okay, a very good computer. The goods were distributed to me on the 20th, but why the price cut on the 20th didn't help me maintain the value? I returned 500 on the 21st, and I was really dizzy. 
0	I bought this book because it was very hot, I stayed on the list for a long time, and because of my personal love of literature and history. However, when it came time to watch it, I felt disappointed. Of course, this is more related to personal hobbies. I don't like its language style very much and lack a sense of reality. However, it has been lingering on the list for so long, and perhaps its attractiveness, but I haven’t found it yet. 
0	I feel that the author's views are completely opposite to my own, and it is difficult to agree with the author's views! There may be cultural and regional differences! I bought more than a dozen books, and I think this book is the most useless. A waste of money! 
0	"The overall feeling is very bad, especially from the Disneyland Hotel the previous night, == But objectively speaking, this hotel definitely does not meet the four-star standard. With such a high price, I would expect one Better, clean room environment, and satisfactory service. It was also because of the rush to book a room. Despite the reviews of many people, I finally booked this room with anxiety. It is said that it is very close to the subway, but in the process, I saw a gorgeous Guangdong Hai, which looks newer and more modern in appearance, and is closer to the subway station. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk staff were very unwelcome~~~~~ There was no smile. The two of us were already frightened on the inexplicable bar street == 0, and we had to look at the front desk when we arrived at the hotel. Smelly face, unhappy! The room has a very strange smell, uh, of course it is a strange smell! It feels very old, no matter what, the bathroom is like what you said, the sink is broken, the water is slow, and the shower is not easy to use. I called the front desk and asked for repairs, but the front desk couldn't understand Mandarin, so I ""consciously"" switched the call to English service. Even so, no one came to check in the end. When I was sleeping, I found that the quilt was still dirty and black, and my heart was cold again. In view of the fact that we had to stay in such a place for a few nights, we had to close one eye, deceive ourselves and live in peace. The next day I put 20 Hong Kong dollars on the bedside table, so the hygiene of the second day is better than that of the first day,,,==0 It is recommended that friends who live here go back to the hotel at night and detour to Hennessy Road, and go out from exit b to the left. The street is much more normal. It seems to take less time than exiting from c. All in all, the price is too expensive for this hotel, and it is not economical. Anyway, I will never go to this hotel again! ! ! ! ! "
0	A very general book, full of imaginary idealism, it is recommended that fresh graduates in the workplace should never read it. 
0	The single room is very small, only a small bed and a small sofa can be put down. The air conditioner in the first room is broken, and the room is changed, even the sofa is gone! The room facilities are outdated, but the bathroom is ok. It is not up to the four-star standard at all, and even business hotels like Home Inn can't keep up. It is strongly not recommended 
1	Overall it's OK. When installing the system, you need to enter the BIOS and change the SATA mode to IDE to install. 
0	It's just relying on the name to attract people's attention. The content is empty and has no practical meaning. It is all nonsense that everyone understands. 
1	The room is not bad, but it is a bit old. There is no yogurt for breakfast. 
0	A room of 388 yuan is worth 248 yuan. Internet access is charged and the IP is manually configured. If you die, you will no longer live. 
0	This hotel is a residential building, changed from the 31st floor to a hotel. I stayed in a one-bedroom, one-bedroom unit. Although there is an open kitchen and a cooking stove, there are no cooking utensils. The hall is very large, but it only has a double-seat sofa. The twin room is pitifully small. The bed is only one meter wide. The bathroom is also very small. The shower tank is close to the toilet and sink. The remaining space can only accommodate one person. It is advisable to drink tea in the restaurant downstairs quite economically. The neighborhood is all high-end residential areas, there are no shopping, the price of $370 is really not worth it. 
1	The configuration is good, and the advanced version of Vista installation disk is good, although I don't like it! It is not easy to leave fingerprints on the A side, the weight is OK! The esata interface can be used as USB~! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	Take the children to Hong Kong through Ctrip's free tour. Langham Place, who has lived in Mong Kok, chose Lang Court because he still likes Tsim Sha Tsui. The lobby of the hotel is nice, I don’t know why so many people are too small. I was lucky to be upgraded. I booked two rooms but the other one didn't work well. The lady at the front desk gave us a 100 yuan tax-free shop voucher for each room and took us all the way to the room, which made me flattered. The rooms have just been renovated and have oak floors, which are rare in mainland hotels. I can see a little sea view from my window. Later I saw the notice on the table and realized that the upstairs was being renovated. But we went out during the day and didn't feel it. Those days were very cool, which was really unexpected compared to 37 degrees in Shanghai. My child has been to Disney in the United States twice, so we only have the cable car and sea view here, which is the best! On the last day, I told the hotel to check out late. Children can swim and take a bath before leaving after a half-day trip. The 3-day trip was very tiring, but the hotel bed was very comfortable and I slept well at night. 
1	The hotel generally feels pretty good, but one of the better ones is that they have a large indoor swimming pool. According to the staff, it is currently the best swimming pool in Yangzhou with rockery, artificial waves, and excitement. I suggest you try it when you stay in the hotel. In addition, the room we stayed in was also good. It is said to be newly renovated. The size of the room is basically the same as that of the suite, and the equipment is very advanced. 
0	It is really a very ordinary hotel and should not be a choice of residence in Hong Kong. Because: 1. It is difficult to find in a small alley; 2. The price is expensive and the room is small, which means that the small domestic single room dare to call a standard room; 3. The front desk service is indifferent and always rolls eyes towards mainlanders . 
0	The machine is very thick and a little heavy. This trust must have to carry power and other things. The machine plus battery power is more than 6 kilograms. 
1	Cheap 4699, high configuration, 2.16 cpu, 2g memory, 1g video memory, relatively invincible, big, large screen, stable shape, also with a camera, the same price configuration is invincible, the same configuration, the price is invincible 
0	The delivery time is too slow, 8 days have passed, is there no system or something? Why doesn't it move after opening it, showing root localhost, can anyone help me explain, what should I do? Should I contact JD or Acer? 
1	The room in the annex building is a bit old, it really needs to be refurbished, especially the carpet part, otherwise it is good overall. The breakfast service is still okay, still good. 
0	Although TV, Internet and other media have hyped Dan, I don't appreciate her comments on the Analects. Perhaps the benevolent see benevolent, and the wise see wisdom. 
0	The bathroom in the room is poor and unsatisfactory. The general feeling is not very good. However, the hygiene of personal products is still very standardized, neat and packaged. 
0	It is easy to leave fingerprints, not a perfect screen, there is a point, the screen is lg. The touchpad is a bit hot, and the battery is only 1.5 hours. Not alone, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t play large games 
1	After turning on the TV, a welcome message to the guests is scrolling on the screen, which makes it warmer. The rooms are relatively clean, the bathroom facilities are relatively complete, and the transportation near the hotel is relatively convenient. 
1	At the time of the dispute between Liu Bin and Koji, I would like to say a few more words. I feel that there are not so many grievances for ordinary people, but at critical moments, such as the advent of war, the people will be kidnapped by the state apparatus and involuntarily involved in disputes. Pure nationalism cannot solve the problem, and of course it is not abandoning principles and unconditionally accommodating compromises. Improving national strength and deepening understanding are feasible ways to resolve grievances. 
0	The hotel is really not very good, I don't know how to rate it four stars. The room is small and old, there is nothing to eat for breakfast, the service is not good, and there will be nuisance calls 
0	The layout is too small! It’s not very good. It’s great if it’s a big version, it won’t be obvious, and the characters can be bigger, isn’t it great? The child doesn't like it very much now. 
1	It is a 15-minute walk from Gongbei Pass. It is very convenient. The deluxe standard room in the hotel is too small and the bathroom facilities are a bit old, but the hot water is sufficient. The change to the 07 series room (such as 1607 1107) makes a big difference. I learned from the local travel agency , Through them, the reservation price is 300 yuan, which is different from the 350 yuan price of Ctrip. The breakfast is not enough to eat, but the service is good. We have to leave at 7 in the morning, and the hotel arranges to pack it to the room before the breakfast start time. 
0	Why do I need to brush the motherboard and import the code certificate to install VISTA? There are too few USB ports, and it is very inconvenient to plug in the mouse. 
1	The receptionist at the front desk was a little rigid and could not take the initiative to introduce various matters to guests, and the service was relatively passive 
0	There are a few small flaws on the screen, which can be ignored; there is no anti-virus software, maybe it is the special price 
1	"It supports XP perfectly. I didn’t dare to buy HP and ACER because I was afraid that I could not install XP. This one did not disappoint me. In BIOS, ACHI can choose IDE. All XP drivers can be downloaded by entering the product number on Lenovo website. The price is 4999. It is reasonable, the screen is good, and the heat dissipation is average. After a period of time, the touchpad will get hot. If you need to disable the touchpad for an external mouse, you need to install an old version first, select ""Disable TOUCHPAD when there is a USB pointing device"", and then Only install the new version, install the new version directly, without this option! "
0	It feels full of plastic, and the material feels crisp and thin, the quality of the screen is really not good, the keyboard is a bit uneven, and the keyboard is not flat... 
1	The real thing looks much better than the picture, which is quite unexpected. The piano-painted shell and abundant interfaces are really surprising. 
0	Just use the battery for 5 hours! The camera is basically unusable at night, it is too dim! Unless there are headlights shining on you! 
1	The quality of the book is very good, and the plot is even more attractive. I have read it twice, but I haven't understood the author's witty words very much. It may have something to do with age. Now that I'm in a siege, I can't help but admire the author's wonderful ability to use language when I look at the siege again. Humorous, witty, teasing, and profound metaphors fill the full text. When I first read it, I laughed until my belly hurts. The more I look back, it gradually turns into a bitter smile, which makes my heart uncomfortable. Turn to think deeply. The works from 1946 can still be seated one by one today, and there are no lack of such people around you, or me or him. 
0	It is annoying to disturb the phone at night. The quality of the food is not good and the price is not in line with reality 
0	Very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good 
1	"Staying in this hotel several times gave me a feeling of ""customer is God"", especially every time I checked in, the receptionist Mr. Wan Peng gave meticulous and thoughtful service, which made us feel very happy. This is why we like to stay in this hotel every time we come to Nanjing. I talked to my friends about the situation in the hotel, and they also said that they would try the hotel next time. "
0	"Being fooled, there is nothing substantive, but some living habits of the author, the idea is showing off here, and the title of the book is suspect. I prefer the book ""Internal Factors Determine Appearance"" "
1	The hotel is small, but very cozy. The plane arrived at midnight at midnight, and I saw it as soon as I got off the bus at Nanjing Road. It was not as difficult as imagined. In particular, the traffic is very convenient. It is the subway to go out, and Temple Street is a little walk away. This price is really great to live in such a place. There will be a chance to live in the future. 
1	I read the Internet first and bought a copy if I thought it was good. I am deeply touched by the heroes and heroines in the novel who still love each other after being separated for seven years and can still be together happily. There should not be many such things in real life. I think the author's title is pretty good. Not everyone can find someone who is right for them. Even if the right person is right now, there is no guarantee that the right person will be suitable for the future. Therefore, people are always moving forward in turmoil. Not everyone has the courage to go back and chase the scenery that has been missed. In the same place, the scenery may have changed, so it is most important to grasp the beauty of the present and live in the present. 
1	"The love of the Three Lives and Three Worlds is unrepentant, and under the witness of ten miles of burning peach forest, the two finally hold hands happily, but who can tell the twists and turns? After everything was calm and light, the sentence ""Shallow, you come"" that came across thousands of mountains and rivers was moving and sighing. The text intersperses modern language into the ancient plot, which is funny and humorous, but at the same time it makes people cry in laughter. There are many northeastern dialects. I don't know where the son is from! This book is definitely worth reading! "
0	Only after I bought it, I found out that these short stories have been included in Zhang Ailing's book that I bought many years ago, so I feel fooled. 
0	After reading this book, I found that it is not as good as everyone said, and the things written on it are not applicable. The author has too much nonsense and has no substantive content. I doubt the authenticity of Dangdang rankings. Everyone The situation is different, but the author has cited many examples to write, which is not suitable for everyone! I will definitely not buy the second and third one! 
1	Because the language of ancient Chinese poetry is more animalistic and refined, it needs a quiet environment to appreciate. As their carrier, the quality of the printing and binding of a book is better than other types of books. Have a more direct impact on readers. This book can really only be described in two words, exquisite, if the revision is properly accompanied by exquisite illustrations, it can be said to be perfect. In addition: I was pleasantly surprised to find that the page number of this book is actually Chinese characters in antique form, which adds a kind of antique beauty, which is really good! 
0	I bought it only a day later. Another model with similar configuration, but the price of a higher model is much cheaper than this one after the price is reduced. Lost in buying! ! ! 
1	"I feel that the quality is better than ""Three Rescue Marriage"". The content gradually moves from family to society. It is mixed with responsibilities, cares and emotional entanglements between characters. Layer after layer, thrilling. The heroine Xie Huaimin's medical skills are indeed quite professional. It seems that in modern times, the learned Chinese medicine came in handy and became her foreshadowing. However, at the end of the book, it was simply too unexpected. I don't want to be true. Hui Kong in the book said that she can mourn the world. I guessed that if the person she loved was a king, it would be very possible. I hope so. "
1	"Because of my children, I am simply addicted to reading picture books. I still like this set of picture books. ""Follow the Bear"", the child laughed cheerfully as soon as the story was finished. A brave rabbit wants to catch a bear... Do you know what wonderful story happened? ""Kiss in a Pocket"" is really great for preschool children, it is very suitable for children aged six or seven to read. ""Five Little Monsters"" is actually telling children the secrets of nature, and the author's imagination is really rich. ……The other books, please read carefully~ "
0	The vent on the right is not ideal. Installed XP system, but no driver, only V driver, I found some on the Internet, but Bluetooth can’t be used, and some shortcut keys can’t be used, just need XP driver 
1	The room is a bit old. And the room I stayed in was not cleaned after I went in. The front desk and the waiter did not cooperate well. Additional comment December 9, 2007: The service of this hotel is not as good as before, and the facilities are also old. Up. 
0	When the delivery service was poor, the invoice amount was 20 yuan less, and the deliveryman also said that I was asked to find Dangdang directly, he was not responsible. 
1	The environment of the hotel is good, the transportation is convenient, and the quality and attitude of the service staff are even better! This time I went to give us a free upgrade to a business room, the room is big and beautiful! We will definitely choose it next time we go! 
1	Older five-star hotel, the management and maintenance of the hotel is still very good 
0	"It took a long time to get the wireless connection. It turned out that there was a physical switch that had to be turned on. . . First press ""Fn+F11"". . . Then you can. . "
1	The price/performance ratio is good. I have seen it on pconline and it seems that the price has been reduced recently, 3899, but I still get so many things to buy 3999 here, it’s okay! 
0	"""Different Carmela"" is indeed different! With so many books at home, my son has a soft spot for them. Take it off the shelf when it's okay, and read it by yourself. Or just ask me: ""I'm Carmela, who are you mother?"" Let me play the story in the book with him, over and over again, without getting tired of it. It can be seen that this book has been deeply imprinted in his young heart. This is a different book! "
1	With the basic system installed, the operation is fairly smooth. XP drivers can be found in the CD, but not complete. I hope that manufacturers can consider more for customers. 
0	I bought 7 copies in total. Most of the books are of poor quality and light, like pirated copies. I hope the administrator can indicate the quality of the paper. If I find this problem next time, I will return it. . 
1	I brought it up to the Guangzhou headquarters on May Day. The machine is very good, especially the keyboard and stereo. The speed is good, the screen is comfortable, and there is a bright spot, but it's good. It’s been a long time since I turned it on, there is basically no heat, and the fan sound is very small. Determined to be the GM45 chipset. The self-promotion waiter has a good attitude and is very patient. 
1	The environment is good. Check in on August 18th, and the elevator was installed on August 16th. The reservation staff did not understand this information. The best hotel for travel in these few months, the price is high. 
0	It’s not a mirror screen; the fan hasn’t stopped since it was turned on, and the sound is louder; it’s a bit heavier; the express delivery is irresponsible, so I didn’t ask me to sign for it myself. 
0	"The whole book gave me the feeling that after a peasant became rich, he was afraid that others would become rich and squeezed his position. But I don't want to expose my fearful thoughts so obviously, so I use the word ""fair"" to neutralize it. ""Fairness"" is not used like this! Not recommended to buy. If someone who is really curious wants to buy it, I sell this second-hand copy in my hand and contact me. "
1	This series of books are pretty good. I think the books are relatively small. The ancient books have phonetic annotations. You can bring them in your bag and read them when you have time! I don't really like big books, luxurious hardcover editions, or gimmicky books. I like paperback books with more sophisticated layout and printing! Voice Enlightenment is more rhyming, suitable for reading aloud! It's just that there are relatively few notes when editing, and there is no introduction to some rhythms and poetry systems. The average reader may not understand it, and the effect of reading will be compromised! I have been waiting for almost a year. I haven't bought all of this set of books. Some of them are always out of stock. Why? 
1	The appearance is beautiful, I have seen it in the physical store, and I was not disappointed when I received the goods. Everyone said it was good. The heat dissipation is okay, because the heat sink is used, and I didn't observe it. 
0	Agree with the comments upstairs. Each room will be charged 8 yuan in addition to the listed price. 
0	I first saw my friend borrowed this book, studied it carefully, and found that it was good, and then I had the desire to buy it. I also found that there are many different versions, so I found the version I want to buy and my friend’s book online. When they are exactly the same, I chose your book next to the book, even if the price is more expensive than others (you are 18 yuan, the different editions are generally 16.5 yuan, 16.3 yuan, and 15.9 yuan) I would like to buy it. When the goods are opened, they are still in the diamond version. Why is it not the same as the normal version you posted on the Internet? It feels a bit deceived. Do I want to change the line? Can you give me a contact? Can we communicate? 
0	It may be because of the 6-cell battery, which is still heavier. It feels more expensive than the 12-inch x61. I bought the Linux system and it’s exhausting to install the xp. 
0	Why are there no gifts for me? The gift was given that day, and I ordered the same day. Why is there no gift for me? 
1	Very good hotel, except for the service attitude of the front desk. The room facilities are very good, Philips LCD TV, and computer backup. However, it may be because of the reason that the booking was made through Ctrip instead of direct booking. The location of the room is very poor. 
1	I have read it on the Internet before. I bought it and wanted to collect it. I didn’t want to read it again, not because it’s not good-looking, but because I’m afraid of sadness again. After reading it last time, I stayed there for the next week My heartache and sadness, but this time I can't help but open it up. Maybe everything is arranged by fate. Ning Xi and Si Ye are like sunset and night. They can never coexist. Two people who don’t understand love are there. Feeling love in each other’s hurt, maybe since Ning Xi was born, she was destined to die like a cherry blossom withered~~beautiful and tragic... 
0	It is clearly included in the order. Why are other books already received? Why is there no one? ? ? Why? ? ? 
1	The location of the hotel is good. There is a subway station nearby that can reach everywhere. If you want to save money from the airport, you can take the A31. The room size is relatively large, and the room facilities are relatively complete. Hair dryer, refrigerator, safe, toiletries , Facial tissues are available, the key is that there is a sofa bed in the house, it is very convenient to bring children. The service is also in place, and the overall cost performance is relatively high. 
0	I really don’t have the ability to resist the current cosmetics. As soon as the store advertises and others say it’s good, I get dizzy and follow the trend to buy it. In fact, the simplest things are also the best. After reading this book, I pay more attention to recuperation from the inside out. 
1	The workmanship is very exquisite, comparable to imported SONY notebooks, the one chosen for my wife, is much better than the workmanship of my HP and my friend’s Dell, super quiet 
1	The service is good and the waiter is very friendly. The best thing is that the room is big enough. . The layout of the writing desk is very good. The transportation is also very convenient and the surroundings are also very lively. It is very cheap to walk to the stalls on the top floor of Zhongmin Parkway in 10 minutes. The taste is also good. The only downside is that the breakfast was received a bit early. 
1	The advantage of the computer is the long-lasting battery, which is enough for 6 hours of normal use. The computer display is also great 
1	The weight is relatively light, and the appearance is also good, especially the few indicator lights are cool. Both memory slots are on the back cover, which is convenient for adding memory. With a total of 3G of RAM, there is no problem installing Vista Ultimate. 
1	The life in the city is totally different from our current life. There is no luxurious clothes and no gluttonous food. There is only a school in the cold mountain and the innocent smiles of the children who can read~~ Let me know the world and redefine it. Values don’t matter. Money. We should firmly choose what we love and love. Many people have dreams because reality cannot be realized. But now we are living reality and we do choose by ourselves~~ It is better to say that we have no chance to realize our dreams. Open now and dare not take risks to realize dreams... 
0	I just took it home, installed the XP system and drivers, and the others can be used. My friend copied a few movies, installed Baofengyingyin, opened the movie, it crashed after a minute or two, turned it off again, and it crashed again after a few seconds. Reinstalling a player is still the same. After reinstalling the system driver, watching the movie is still the same, still crashing. 
1	Most of my friends who come to Beijing live here. I feel that the suites facing south are not bad, and the other orientations are not good. The price should be lowered by one level. Especially the two ends, which is particularly bad. My friend is very dissatisfied. In addition, parking The fee is very expensive, and it costs more than 10 yuan to eat a meal. The parking should be free of charge!!! 
0	The battery is not as good as said. After half a month, I have been using the battery for 67 hours, starting with 8 hours. The effect is not as ideal as expected. 
1	"Bing Xin’s book has been kept by her side since junior high school. She was tired and irritated, so she picked up her prose and read it. As the text progressed, her heart calmed down...Bing Xin’s Those words, the ones I like most, and the ones I read the most are prose. They don't have the ups and downs of novels, the power of rejuvenation, and the sharpness of a dagger. However, the broad and profound love that permeated the text was deeply embedded in my life and melted into my soul. Therefore, I learned about simple happiness very early, knowing how to ""be contented and happy"", knowing tolerance and love... "
0	This is the second time to stay, because it is very close to the customer, it is convenient. Let me talk about the first time I checked in. The air conditioner was not cold and the room was like a sauna. I classified it as a problem of luck and ignored it, but the internet speed was so slow that it could only be described as unbelievably slow. China Telecom's broadband service in this hotel is actually slower than dial-up Internet access. I am an eye-opener. Let me say the second time, starting from the checkin, I decided not to come to this hotel for the third time. The male employee at the front desk should not say anything, plus a nonchalant tone, asking for three sentences. I barely returned a few words, I thought, maybe it's the boss's son, otherwise I really can't think of the reason why the hotel uses this kind of staff. The chef in the breakfast cooking area didn’t know how to educate. He always hid and wanted to get a bowl of noodles. After standing for a long time, he couldn’t see anyone. The lady at the service counter just pretended not to see me. I hope that one thing is worse than one thing less. The room equipment is normal this time. It's so easy to drive away a guest. There is no way to find or manage the inapplicable employees, that is the problem of hotel management. I can only say that if your hotel feels that you don't want to be a four-star hotel at all, then I apologize for my fault. I also apologize to the vast majority of dedicated employees. 
1	I booked a double room for 430 yuan. The room size and facilities are good. The bathroom only has a shower room, which is very practical, which I admire. The breakfast is also good, both Chinese and Western. Disadvantages: The hotel restaurant closes at 8pm. In order to remind the guests who are still dining, the lights are turned off. It makes people feel like eating in a bar. It feels like this service is not four-star enough; the hotel does not have a parking lot, and the parking is right there. The small piece of dried tofu at the gate, and it also charges for the hotel guests, which is not convenient for motorists; the hotel gave us two rooms close to the elevator, and the clinking of the elevators stopped one after another overnight, making it impossible Fall asleep. I have encountered many times that the rooms arranged by the hotel for Ctrip guests are relatively unsatisfactory, I hope it is not this time. The shop opposite the hotel is famous for selling thousands of packs. I couldn't go this time because of the tight schedule, so I must try it next time. After getting off the highway and driving across the South Taihu Bridge in the evening, the evening sunlight and the newly lit lights flooded the bridge and the new city along the way. It was very beautiful. The first time I went to Huzhou, although I was in a hurry, I left a great impression. I plan to stay internationally next time I go on vacation (hope that the elevator bell will be improved next time). However, the consumption in Huzhou is not as good as that in Shanghai. The price of Ctrip is not very competitive. force. In recent years, Ctrip's housing prices are not competitive. Ctrip is equivalent to a travel agency and should be able to get far better prices than individual customers. Should we respond to many loyal users in this regard? 
0	The pre-installed system is Vista and it consumes resources. So I didn’t ask for the 1g one for 7000 yuan. I was afraid of stuck, but the disk I sent was XP. 
0	The price is ok, but the location is a bit back, many taxis are not well known, and it is a one-way road so the traffic is not very convenient. But considering the price factor, this store is okay. The room with a window is exposed in the corridor, no curtains are not good for sound insulation. So privacy is not very good. 
1	Very light The keyboard is comfortable. The heat dissipation is very good. The noise is low, almost no. 
1	Because of Zhang Ailing, Hu Lancheng was known. Because of Teacher Chen Danqing, he started to look at this life and this life. I have to say that reading this book is extremely enjoyable. Words, beauty; sentences, beauty; articles, beauty. In the text, I can see the man in the long gown with a little Jiangsu and Zhejiang accent, unhurriedly talking about everything he has seen and experienced. The text is charming but not vulgar. Because he understands women and knows the goodness of each woman, this Ming Dynasty woman, every woman, whether traditional or current, is so cute. 
1	I first found this book while waiting for the plane at the airport. I thought it was very good, so I kept reading it standing there. Because the airport does not offer discounts, I bought it on Dangdang as soon as I got home. I have read a lot of her books, I like her and I like her books, the intellectual beauty, the confidence of success, but only after reading her books can I know that, so success is also paid, and all efforts will be rewarded. There are many kinds of beauty of women, but the beauty of the author is not only diminished by the passing of youth. Outside of busy work and life, reading this book will make you think a lot. 
0	"As the child grows up, this book has become the child's favorite (1 year and 7 months), and it is necessary before going to bed for more than 2 months. The child’s favorite is the last page. Sometimes when I talk, I turn to the end all at once. When I said David’s mother said ""I love you"", the baby girl also looked up and waited for me to say ""I love you."" "" "
0	Hardware facilities are too old, next to the street, the environment is very noisy, the price is high, not 4 stars 
0	Piano paint shortcomings easy to leave fingerprints Fingerprint collector C drive 220G, DM can be installed when the hard disk mode is changed from ACHI to another, XP High Difinition Audio driver can not be installed, can make a sound, let it go, disable it, it will not prompt installation

0	The internet in this hotel is simply terrible, it has delayed a lot of work, changed a few rooms, can never send out emails, and cannot open web pages. 
0	It is probably the reason for the lightness. Eyes hurt. I am worried that it is the snowflake screen. If you darken your eyes, you will feel comfortable. The case is relatively old. The case is marked April 15th when it leaves the factory. There is even an unpackaged power cord, which is a bit suspected to be a repair machine. The battery can only display the percentage during use, not the remaining time. 
1	The location is very good, beside the South Lake, you can see the South Lake through the window of the room, which is very pleasant. The hotel’s service is also good, but the hotel carpet looks too dirty 
0	1. The keyboard is good-looking, but it’s a bit shaky. 2. It’s more troublesome for novices to install windows. I installed dual systems, and it’s okay with vista home basic

1	I fell asleep when I watched it last night. I woke up this morning and grabbed it and continued to nibble. It coincided with the end of the novel, and just as the author expected, I was taken aback. This is the most unexpected fact when I read Keigo Higashino's novels. There are many kinds of love, but when it becomes a burden, is it still love? Love has many manifestations. When a certain behavior makes the other person feel guilty, can it still be called love? Love can last a long time. When this eternity becomes a nightmare, can it be attributed to the original love? Love can go deep into the bone marrow and cannot be cut off. When it accepts unpredictable variables, can it be consistent? 
0	I don't like it. The content of the book is very scattered, similar to the form of a blog. I write where I think about it. There is no systematic summary. There are many questions and answers between patients and doctors, which are not universal. Although some of the content and viewpoints are good for reference, overall I don't like this book very much. I plan to forward it to the elderly. Maybe she will like this book if she has time to study hard. 
0	When will the book arrive? It’s been 10 days and I haven’t seen the goods yet. It’s not so long before the cash on delivery. Really, I don’t feel nervous after receiving the money. ! ! ! ! 
1	"Although I repeated a copy, I couldn't resist the temptation and bought the second album. My daughter really liked ""I Don't Want to Be Eaten"". From the moment I got the book, I couldn't wait to tell it. I told it three times in one breath. , But ""I like her so much"" but didn't even look at it. Maybe I don’t like the name, so I don’t even listen to it. "
1	Nice environment, room facilities are very good, very high-grade, next time I will consider staying 
1	Nice hotel, but the TV is a bit smaller, I will stay next time. 
1	Apart from being close to the airport, there is nothing to say. There should be no 5 stars. 
1	Small business book, calm style and exquisite workmanship. The keyboard feels good and the size is good. The screen is 10?, the eyes are not tired when working. The configuration is also remarkable. 
1	Good workmanship! Not too heavy! high speed! It's not hot either! ! The camera is very clear! The keyboard is also good! 
0	I booked two standard rooms through Ctrip at the beginning of August, 340 yuan each. I thought the four-star standard room should be very good, but when I went there, it was the standard of a guest house. The decoration was old and the room was small. The 25-inch TV is still locked in the cabinet. Very worthless, I will definitely not go here again next time. 
1	My girlfriend bought one. I saw that it looks pretty good, and the price is so cheap. I just thought about changing the computer, so I decided~ The speed is okay. I originally bought a 1G RAM and wanted to expand it to 2G. Unexpectedly, when I opened it, I found that there was only one memory slot. I didn't take this into consideration. Hey, the 1G bar was discarded. The weight is still a bit heavy, but I basically don't run around with it on my back. 
1	He booked a hotel for a colleague. His brother just came back from Dongguan and asked in detail about his impression of Guangdong Hotel. He said it was hardware and software: excellent! So praise 
1	The room is clean and tidy, the waiter is very nice, but the restaurant is average. The set meal on the breakfast voucher given to me does not match the set meal in the restaurant 
0	Very poor, I ordered a deluxe suite but I feel that I have just been vacuumed, nothing is really bad, let alone I am in 
1	Reasonable configuration, fast speed, no system, no software. The screen is not broken. The appearance is okay, I bought this for the first time, no experience and not much money 
1	"I saw this book by chance, which made me, a person who was very afraid of entering the hospital, brightened up. The phenomenon mentioned repeatedly here is not what we often say is faulty, and the various machines in the hospital can’t find it. ""Sub-health""? I also figured out how to treat my ""sub-health"" with my surrounding relatives and friends. So I bought a set through ""Dangdang.com"". After reading it, I liked it very much, so I bought a few more books for my friends and elders. , I believe they must like this book as much as I do. "
1	My colleagues bought notebooks from several major manufacturers at the same price. Lenovo’s black L3000 is the most beautiful, with good heat dissipation, a good keyboard feel, and a reasonable socket location. The LED backlight has uniform brightness and bright colors. highly recommended! The lines on the C side are very bright, like one. Lenovo's after-sales service is also very good. No pre-installed system, download a Lenovo oemxp online and get it! 
0	"The configuration looks good, it is known as the game king, but I run cs1.6 (the original system), the card ~ and the heat is large, there is no official driver for the xp system, and xp has not been installed. It is said that after installing xp, it may ""desktop navigation"" It won’t work, so I haven’t tried it yet. The display will vibrate like a spring when touched "
1	The configuration is balanced (additional memory is required, otherwise the memory is a short board), reasonable price, good heat dissipation, and well-made. The screen is great. . Perfect screen, running for 250 hours without any problems. 
0	It's not that I don't like it, but the content of the story is too chaotic, giving people a sense of complexity. Since my personal literary accomplishment has not reached a certain level, my personal evaluation is: average! 
1	Samsung perfect screen, Samsung memory, Western Digital hard drive, power adapter is quite small, I installed Tomato XP, and there is no black screen phenomenon yet. 
1	The environment is very good, the garden is large, the service ecology is also very good, it is very close to the airport and very convenient, not bad, consider staying again next time 
1	I bought it for a friend and I think it's not bad! The cost-effectiveness is also beautiful, and the basic performance can be handled as long as you don't play big games. 
1	Personally like poems, I naturally like the stories behind them. Every time I see classic works, I think about the wonderful picture scrolls displayed by poetry, it is really a wonderful feeling. The author asks today through his own walking antiques, showing us the stories behind the classics and unfolding a beautiful picture. The magnificent rivers and mountains and the rustic style are constantly on the paper. Personally, the disadvantage is that the author's text is slightly dry and not rich enough in some chapters, which is a pity. The illustrations in the article are typical of traditional Chinese ink and wash landscape paintings. 
1	"A friend once said that once a man starts to love, he will be more serious than a woman. Shen Xianfei is such a man. ""If there is a distance of 1,000 steps between us, as long as you take the first step, I will take the other 999 steps in your direction."" A plain but MAN confession~~~ A misunderstanding and an accident caused The two separated for five years. But there are traces of each other on their bodies, even if they are lost, they can finally find each other. Sang Yu's persevering pursuit is absolutely comparable to the jade-faced little flying dragon. The story of Ah Zheng and Zheng Wei continues perfectly in this book~~~ "
1	The things are very good value, I bought a few things and used a 2000-100 East coupon, saving 100 yuan, haha. Thank you for the JD coupon provided by this member: http://club.360buy.com/person/grbkrufw-1-1.html 
0	It’s been a long time since I bought books. Why haven’t the books I bought through Alipay arrived a week later than this, I really don’t know what’s going on? Have I been cheated by you! 
1	The material is very good, the weight is not heavy, it is suitable for girls, and it is small. The keyboard is also large, and the 6* battery fluid is very durable 
1	"""Long Leg Papa"" is a good book, and this is Yu Fanqin's translated version, very punctual. It is an English-Chinese contrast, and the stick figures drawn by the author in the letter are not deleted and are very thorough. This book writes about the growth experience of an orphan. She shows us the optimism of people, and changes people's moral views on orphans, and more importantly, orphans' views on themselves. The vast majority of orphans face the charity of others either with justification or inferiority overwhelming. Therefore, I think girls who have read this book may be optimistic, and can more accurately grasp their ideals and pursuits. "
0	Very general, not recommended. However, the title of the book is very good and misled me. I have always been in favor of reading to children and developing the habit of reading. 
0	"It was because my son liked cars and the book received rave reviews, so I decided to buy it. But after buying it for a month, he only read it once, and he refused to read it again. I thought this set of books was bought for nothing, but recently my son suddenly became fascinated by it. He has to read it two or three times a day. Before going to bed at noon and before going to bed at night, I have to read it for a while, and it has become a compulsory course. . Of course, the favorite to watch is ""Lun Lun Lun Zhuan"", he is no longer satisfied with my narration. While watching it, he pointed at the ground with his little finger, while saying ""crash"", ""wheel broken"", big mouth rubbish. Car?...Wait, that little appearance is serious. This set of books has become our family's book treasure. I only rated it with two stars last time, and there is no way to change it. I have to give it a big five-star here! In addition, I personally suggest this: For families with young boys, they can buy it for children over 2 years old, especially for boys who like cars, just buy it. "
0	The rooms are ok, the facilities are simple, not like a four-star standard. The breakfast is pretty plentiful, but I have to go early. The reception, settlement speed and attitude are pretty good. The backyard parking lot is very characteristic. Two cars were scratched in one night. It’s really scary. The most important thing is that the security guards and the little boss still don’t want to admit it. 
1	Dear Andre, the conversation between mother and child is broad and open. I, who is about the same age as Andre, have learned a lot from the letters from my mother, Long Yingtai, and also know that I am growing up. Some difficult problems. I think the life experience of parents is always richer than ours, but the communication between us is getting less and less, and we may be able to experience the suffering when we are parents. I also like this young man Andre. Ms. Long said that the fate of our parents and us is to watch us leave again and again. As we grow up, we also begin to get used to our parents' old age... 
1	"The ending of the book was very optimistic, but after reading the extravaganza, in the end Jiaqi was still with Meng Heping and gave birth to a lovely daughter named ""Meng Memorial"", in memory of Ruan Zhengdong and also in memory of that period of youthful years. As written in the book, ""I thought it was just a relationship to let go, but in the end it was a lifetime"", this book taught me to cherish, cherish life, cherish friendship, cherish love, and cherish life (Ruan Zhengdong is too pity). ""A Dreamlike Flower on the Sea"" is also very beautiful! "
0	As a well-known online store in China, how can Dangdang sell books of such quality? The cover of the book has been torn apart, and the delay in contacting and returning the goods is really disappointing. Everyone has learned a lesson from my book purchase, and I have to re-examine Dangdang! ! 
1	I went with my parents, so I lived in the family room and didn't see the invincible river view. Generally speaking, the hotel is relatively clean. There are particularly many Koreans. But there is always a strange smell in the room, the toilet leaks occasionally, and the shower head is designed to splash water easily. Breakfast is not good. Although there are many shortcomings, it is already regarded as the top hotel in Dandong. 
0	I read a fairly good review and set a standard room, but both the hardware and the service are disappointing. The hardware facilities are not as good as the average farmhouse. The windows and doors are side by side in the corridor. The ventilation is very poor. The strong smell of musty and cigarettes comes from the door when we enter the room, which prevents us from closing the windows and bathroom all night. There is no water retaining strip on the floor of the shower facility, and the floor is full of water as soon as you take a bath. The front desk service was cold and cold. We arrived at 11 o'clock and said that the room hadn't been cleaned yet. Let us wait in the lobby. After that, no one took care of us. After half an hour, we went to the front desk to ask before we went through the formalities. . 
0	1 The hotel is rather inconvenient to take a taxi. 2 There is a KTV upstairs in the hotel, which is very noisy at night, especially for the guests living on the fifth floor. 3 Front desk reception, blunt attitude. Those who book through Ctrip are not welcome. The lady who received me gave me a business card and asked me to book a room and call the hotel directly. It is annoying to say that Ctrip has to send a fax back. That lady seems to have a surname Feng. 4Too much water in the house price The price of the room price is 516 yuan, but the general booking will usually be sold at 318 yuan as long as the price is negotiated. 5The day after I checked in, after I checked out, I had to check in because I had something to do. The front desk heard that it was booked through Ctrip and directly answered that there was no room reservation (the city did not have any major events on that day, and it was not a tourist season) 6 rooms The price inside is much higher than outside. A bottle of mineral water worth one yuan outside is priced at 5 yuan in the room. And there is no shopping place near the hotel. 7The sense of service is too bad. I asked the front desk staff about the local weather forecast and said that I don’t know. 8Breakfast is poor, some dishes are still cold 　 The hotel has good facilities but lacks effective management, poor service awareness, and even a bit of a big shop, although it is not a big shop 
1	1. The screen is good, the colors are bright, and no dead pixels are found. Highlights. It is AUO's panel 2. Unique appearance, blue paint, very stylish 3. Dolby sound effect 4. Samsung memory, Samsung DVD burning, Western Digital 250G hard drive When buying digital products online, you are afraid of second-hand goods. After receipt, the packaging is intact. The notebook seal is intact. SN is correct. Some rest assured. 
1	When I first saw this book, I picked it up and flipped through it...I was attracted by one of the wonderful little stories...However, behind each story, there will be related reasons behind it! Reading it, it feels like a wash of the soul. Let us learn to look at the various human relationships that happen in our lives in a better state of mind... People in busy cities often ignore these most common and simple happiness and Happiness... and this book is a good list of the happiness and happiness that everyone has forgotten, release the shackles of the soul, and obtain real happiness and happiness! 
0	Poor price-performance ratio, worse hotel integrity, I tried to stay once and decided not to stay again. Hotel feedback July 7, 2008: The guest originally booked a standard double room and wanted to change to a double room after arriving. These two room types exist The difference in price has caused misunderstanding between both parties due to the difference in communication. We apologize and regret this guest. 
0	I only bought it when I saw the high evaluation of this book on the Internet. But after reading a few pages, I regretted buying this book. Can't stand it anymore. It's a waste of time. Looking at the author’s resume, I seem to be a pretty good person, but what is written in the book is the words of Che Yu. The same content is repeated over and over again in different languages, as if to cheat the manuscript fee. Rubbish. Now it’s on the shelf and I don’t want to look at it. 
1	Traveling in China for the first time in more than ten years, I stayed in a hotel with such good service, very careful and enthusiastic about details, and actively providing services to guests. Mr. Hao is more cordial and feels far better than a five-star hotel. I highly recommend everyone to come. Staying here is absolutely good service beyond your imagination. I personally think that this is the best hotel in China. 
1	It is still one of the best value-for-money hotels in Liuzhou. The scale and quality of the hotel rooms are justifiable, and the location is also good. Basically close to the four-star standard. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and Love, Liuzhou Hotel is committed to creating the most cost-effective hotel in Liuzhou. The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
0	Really bad hotel, poor service attitude. I was still locked in the elevator, suffering! Breakfast is special! It is better to choose the lakeside hotel to stay in Qiqihar. 
1	"I thought it was a very thick book when I received it. After disassembling, I can't wait to read it, and it took a few hours to read it. I originally thought that the novel of the same name in ""Secrets That Cannot Be Telled"" should be as great as the movie, but after reading it, I felt that the author of the novel seemed to have distorted the content. Is Jay's script written like this? The novel is not very good, the bookmarks and scores are very good, the scores are really super feel! Separate into a book, as well as playing skills of stills and scores. When I think about it, it seems that it's more worthwhile to spend this money on piano scores. Overall, the price/performance ratio is still very high. "
0	After I bought something in the store, I always called me, saying that I became their member because I bought something, and then I promoted Dae Jang Geum, health care products and so on. How many have I received? Ten, so annoying. Dangdang's management of the shop in the shop is too bad, how can we give our contact number to others casually. It's been almost half a year, and there are still calls. It's really intolerable and annoying. 
1	"Love this book very much! The quality of the book is very good! Examining historical events is the focus of this book and the essence of the whole book. This book, along with Qian Daxin's ""Twenty-two History Researches"" and Wang Mingsheng's ""Seventeen History Discussions"", is also called the three major historical masterpieces of the Qing Dynasty. But this book is even better. The author is knowledgeable and profound, based on historical facts, focusing on induction and deductive reasoning, which is convincing. The publication of Phoenix (Ancient Books in Jiangsu) is reassuring! If you are weak in ancient Chinese, don't buy this version. In a sense, this book helps improve the level of classical Chinese. "
0	The heat dissipation may be a little bit worse and the performance is average. Generally, there is no big problem for 3D games, but large ones may not work well. 
0	Take it back and install the system, and the machine keeps ringing until half of it is installed, like it is about to explode! ! ! Was taken aback. Forced to shut down and reinstalled, during which the optical drive suddenly made a strong noise, just like a drag racing, fearing it will fly. After the system was installed, I couldn't shut it down, and it crashed. I was so depressed all afternoon with fear. 
0	I took my family to stay for one night during the Dragon Boat Festival. I felt that the service was poor and could not reach the four-star standard. Below I will make a comment from both hardware and service aspects: 1. Hardware 1. The hotel is well located and prosperous; at night Very quiet (I stayed in the East Building); 2. The hotel room is very small (especially the bathroom), which is comparable to Hong Kong hotels; 3. There is no door handle in the room’s closet, which makes it very difficult to open; 4. The Simmons mattress is very Soft (good Simmons should be harder); 5. The soundproofing of the room is not good. On the night I checked in, there was a wedding room next to it. Many people were in the room and the sound was very clear; 2. Service 1. There was no toothbrush in the room, I I dialed extension 16 and asked for it, but the operator asked me to call another number (the hotel check-in card clearly stated that there is a requirement to dial 16 directly); 2. Go to the Chinese restaurant on the second floor for dinner, and the waiter told the Chinese restaurant to move to the same day The abalone restaurant is on the first floor; the waiter gave a menu of the abalone restaurant on the first floor. I asked the waiter for the Chinese restaurant menu, but the waiter said no. I asked, the Chinese restaurant moved to the first floor. Hasn’t the menu been moved down? At this time, the waiter reluctantly gave me the menu of the Chinese restaurant; 3. Because the reservation was made through Ctrip, he gave me a 20 yuan point card. After the meal, we gave the point card to the waiter. Since the waiter has already printed the bill and didn't want to reprint it, he said that you will use it again next time. We are from another place. I don't know it will be the year of the monkey next time; 4. Went to eat breakfast the next morning. Because the child (16 months old) refused to eat breakfast and was crying, the waiter came over and said to my child that he would spank if he cried! We can say this as parents, but your hotel attendants should never say this. I hope you apologize! 5. When you come and go after the meal, when you walk to the entrance of the restaurant, the waiter will look at you with his eyes, without even saying hello. Lived a lot of four-star, five-star, I have never seen such a rude. Hotel Feedback June 17, 2008: I sincerely apologize to you on behalf of the hotel for the unpleasantness that occurred during your stay. Thank you very much for your comments and criticisms, and we have also fed back your problems to the relevant departments , Conducted training and rectification. We hope to have the opportunity to provide services to you again, I believe it will make you feel different. 
1	When I read this book, it was in my unprecedented collapse. After reading it, I had a lot of inspiration. I knew that although my emotions could not be suppressed, I should let him go and learn to surrender. Thoughts and fulfillment of what I wanted have made myself a great change in the present. From a sadness to an effort to adjust. Then I watched many books and movies mentioned in the books, and I became clearer and clearer. The pain comes from my own thoughts, and my current life is also related to my own thoughts. From a negative to a positive, although I can't apply it flexibly, I have benefited a lot. 
0	1. I live in a standard room by the road. The facilities in the room are simple, and there is a layer of curtain wall glass outside the glass windows of the room, and it cannot be opened, resulting in the room cannot be naturally ventilated and the lighting is not good. 2. Eat three breakfasts, the variety is pitiful. 3. The restaurant on the second floor is rented out, and the price is very expensive. It turns out that when ordering meals, I told the guests that they can get a 10% discount (it is clearly stated in the room service guide, but when the checkout is made, it is told that seafood and beverages cannot be discounted, and there is no invoice. It is difficult to find the manager the next day Get the invoice. In general, the gap with the four-star is too big! 
0	"This is a hotel that makes me less satisfied. Because it was too late to book the hotel, I did not book the ""Junyi Kangnian Hotel"" next door. I thought the Cullinan and Junyi Kangnian would be separated by a wall, which would not be too bad. The result was too disappointing for me: 1. It’s so bad that you can still hear sounds that shouldn’t be heard in the corridor and the next door until 2:00 in the middle of the night; 2. The equipment is average, and the facilities are basically aging; the thing that makes me very sick is that the disposable toothbrushes provided are very soft. And the most terrible thing is that the toothbrush shed hair unexpectedly, the toothbrush bristles that fell out can be felt on the tongue but can’t be found. It made me rinse my mouth for a long time before feeling refreshed in my mouth; I changed another toothbrush the next morning. The effect is the same, dizzy. Because of this disgusting experience, I still have to come up to review the hotel after more than a month. This hotel is too bad for the housing price of Changsha. If you have to live nearby, I strongly recommend going to Junyi Kangnian next door. "
0	This book is not as good as it is stated in the propaganda. After buying a home, I am not interested in reading it. Originally I wanted to buy it for my children to learn English. After I got the book, it turned out to be Chinese with English words. I don't agree with this method of learning English words out of the article. 
1	Perfect screen, I haven't noticed a single point for the time being. The machine takes about 4 hours to power on the hard drive, which is acceptable. The memory is added to 4G, which is a bit slower than my desktop, but for individuals, this configuration is sufficient. 
0	The optical drive is not very good, the noise is too loud, the camera is not clear at all, and it is 1.3 million. 
1	1. The room facilities are relatively old, but they are very, very clean. The quality of moisturizer, shower gel and shampoo are all good, better than many 5 stars, and smells good. 2. The location is located in the commercial area. In the center, [Highly recommended] Exit the door of the hotel and turn left to the small road behind the hotel. There is a small octopus ball. His chicken skewers and small balls are very delicious, but the facade is very small and the business is very good. 
0	Why don't we notify if there is no stock? ? ? I just received the book I ordered, but this one is missing, so depressed! 
0	1. There is no hard drive indicator; 2. The left half of the keyboard is soft, and the keyboard on the left protrudes downward when typing; the three I bought are the same. 3. The battery can be used for up to 2 hours and more than a quarter of an hour; 4. The body There is no button to adjust the volume. Everything else is acceptable 
0	I have been posting here a few days ago, and you can send them all. It’s not too late for the evaluation. Now it’s okay. For personal reasons, I need to transfer this machine and bring Jingdong’s warehouse receipt and invoice at a price of 2500 yuan. Transfer, thanks! ) 
0	The memory is small, only 1G, not a discrete graphics card, no camera, and the hard disk is not 320G. The interface layout is not very convenient, but if you want to arrange it like Pop, it is estimated that the heat dissipation is not good. Those who want to pursue discrete graphics cards and cameras are not at this price. The VISTA system is very uncomfortable. 
1	If you like Michelangelo, if you are moved by his paintings and want to learn more about him and his works, then this is a very suitable book. The writing is humorous, the description is informative, the hand feel of the book is also very good, and it is very comfortable to read. It is one of my treasured books. Michelangelo's unique artistic style and his tense and extremely distrustful personality made him my favorite artist. Those who like him but want to know more about him, please come and read this book! 
1	The location is excellent, the room is warm and the service is good. Business travel options. 
1	After using the machine, it feels that the speed is good, the appearance and workmanship are good, and the temperature is not high. Quiet. Install vista performance. 4.0 all good 
0	There is indeed a smell in the room, and there is also in the elevator. The first impression is not very good; the service attitude of the waiter is not very good and expressionless; does not feel at home; the standard room for 200 yuan is not very big, but it is ok The remote control is not easy to use. I called the front desk several times before I came to see it. They said that the contact was not good and there was no extra to replace; the TV was turned off manually before going to bed at night; it was close to KFC Very close; If there are other options, I will not live in this house again; 
1	Transportation: Convenient, just call a taxi, you must know; Decoration: the style is relatively deep, the style is good. The toiletries are decent, the bath towels look old; Service: Order a supper, can give a clear solution, let us order a takeaway, but It seems that there is room for improvement if you have to check the phone through 114 on your own; Breakfast: 2 words. There is nothing to eat. At the same time, if it exceeds 9 o'clock, there is almost nothing to eat. Compared with similarly priced hotels such as Meiyuan, there is A big gap. It is also the worst breakfast I have eaten at a similar price. Others: the mm who checked in is worthy of praise. I arrived at the hotel 10 minutes after the Ctrip phone booked, and the hotel has not received the fax. Can help me contact Ctrip, and my attitude Very sincere. The mm who checked out was quite satisfactory. The doorman, he was stingy when he went out of the hotel and said something like: Goodbye, goodbye, sir. Maybe I'm picky? 
0	Wrong address, bad environment, inadequate service, a bit fooled 
1	"The author uses a poem-like language to speak clear and transparent thoughts like water, like an experienced and wise old man who solves life’s problems one after another for us, allowing us to transcend spontaneous self and secular concepts and guide us We are moving towards the bright and rational side. What is especially amazing is that in such an early age, the author had such a deep understanding of some psychological problems and was able to analyze some life problems so profoundly and thoroughly! It is indeed very valuable! Compared with the previous ""Meditations"" by the Roman emperor, I don't know how many times better it is. "
1	It was found out of the box that one of the USB ports was broken, and the left button of the touchpad was also broken. HP's quality control system can be described as rubbish. To request a replacement, the customer needs to go to the maintenance department of the factory to provide a test certificate. During the replacement process, there is no response to the repair form for multiple days. The waiting time for after-sales calls is extremely long. The service promises 10 days to complete the replacement cycle and it actually took 15 days. During the replacement process, the intermediate price was reduced by more than 400 without price guarantee (not used once), and the goods and services were all garbage.

0	"The Skerry Golden Childhood series is really good, I have bought all 4 albums. The child liked it very much, and I cried for it the night I forced it away. The pictures are very rich, and the text is much more than ordinary picture books. , So I personally think it is suitable for parent-child reading for big babies. My child is just two and a half years old. The entire 4 albums are reserved until she is older. The first and third albums arrived together and showed them to the children. Every day, I must watch ""Lun Lun Lun Zhuan"", <<Busy and Busy Town>>, and the third series all 3 books. I like to find golden bugs. Then one day I took her to the post office and she said that there were some in her book. Sometimes. I really have to admire the children's memory! "
1	During the Spring Festival, I went to Jinhua and stayed in China World Trade Center for a day. The overall feeling is very good. The hardware and service of the hotel are very good. There is a charge for accommodation and parking. Although the charge is not high, it feels awkward. This seems to be a common problem of Jinhua Hotel. Also, the breakfast is 88 yuan, which seems to be too high and not worth it. 
0	1 When the notebook was first started, the fan sounded a bit, but later it stopped. I don’t know why. 2 There is a red dark dot on the top right of the notebook. 
0	If Hu Lancheng feels as comfortable as the article, then it’s great. Some people say that Hu Lancheng is ignorant and cruel. It is like a child who is ignorant and destroys something. He is still asking for credit and rewards, hoping to get everyone's approval. If others are best to clap and applaud, then he will have a clear conscience. Why can't text and people equate? I don't understand! 
0	My goodness, my son really likes to turn around, and he almost turned to pieces in less than a month. Now it can be said that you are memorizing the book backwards. If you reverse the page, he will know what is on the previous page and what is on the back. 
0	The check must be delivered to the account, but the check was given, but it was not there for two days. It took a day to find the check there. The order placed on the 18th was delivered on the 28th, and it was still paid in cash, and the check still did not arrive. I don't know which unit can tolerate such service. 
1	Stayed for two nights in September 2007. Overall evaluation: 1. The service is okay. There are a lot of guests, especially for tour groups. It may be a cheaper and better hotel in downtown Zhaoqing. 2. The room facilities are older, but clean. 3. It is worth living in a viewing room. 
1	"When I was young, I often saw ""Father and Son"" on the back cover of ""Story Meeting"" magazine, and I was very impressed. After seeing the book, she immediately bought it and gave it to her children. The daughter who didn't want to be in the first grade fell in love with the book as soon as she saw it. She even slept next to the pillow for fear of being taken away. Watching the child watching ""Father and Son"" attentively, listening to her laughter from time to time, is really happy. ""Father and Son"" is indeed a good book. The life scenes in the book make everyone feel familiar, and the simple principles contained in the book benefit a lot. I hope it will bring happiness to all readers. "
0	When I got the book, I turned it around and found that the book suddenly jumped from page 154 to page 186 and the words were all upside down...Then it went from page 186 to page 155...The back was normal. ,,,...Looks so inconvenient...affects mood 
1	"I stayed in the ""Superior Room"", but felt that the room hardware was average and not very spacious. The service is ok. "
0	The biggest disadvantage of this hotel is: noisy! The big speakers on the opposite side have been playing during the day, and there is a restaurant inside it! Almost no rest during the day! 
1	The sea view room in the west building actually faces a construction site and is under construction, but fortunately, it does not affect sleep. Free upgrade to a family suite with 3 beds. But the bathroom is smaller, especially the washbasin. Hotel service is good and friendly. That's why there is only one person in Check out during peak hours at noon. Hotel house keeping will not make up slippers. 
1	"My daughter is over 3 years old. After buying these two books, she clamored to do questions every day, saying that she likes rewards. I always say, I want to finish this book before I eat or sleep. These two books are better than the ""Whole Brain Development"" I bought before. The topics are interesting and suitable for children of this age. They also have stickers, writing and painting, and do it while doing it. In particular, the cards designed are very good. Not in the book. There is only one shortcoming. Is it too thick? It can be divided into several volumes, because my daughter always says ""I want to finish it all at once!"" "
0	The book is basically the living environment in Japan, and there is still some difference from the country. Maybe I haven't lived alone, so there is no resonance. I put the book aside before I finished it... Fortunately, I bought a copy of hers. book 
0	I just came back from Jiuhua Mountain and booked the Baisui Villa from Ctrip. The general feeling is okay, but the hall is filled with wonderful fragrance, I don't know what it is, it is a bit pungent. The room is OK, very compact, and the facilities and bath water are good, but there is a strange smell of dampness and not ventilation, and there are traces of uncleanness on the sheets. Fortunately, if we only bet for one day, it will be done. 
1	The environment is good, but when I went to live in the afternoon, none of the three rooms booked were cleaned. 
0	"If the traffic is not convenient, it is very inconvenient if it is not your own car. Especially when they call a car in the morning, they have no sense of time! Room attendants love to lie! The front desk is ok! There are ants and anonymous bugs in the room! I will never live there anymore! I would rather go to Kaiyuan for the same money! Generally speaking, it can be summed up in one word as ""bad"" "
0	I have not received the book and asked me to comment on it. I don't know how Dangdang works, and I don't notify when it is out of stock. I know to collect money~~ 
0	The bathroom of the standard room couldn't get hot water. Later, the waiter and manager were called in and it took half an hour to fix it. . . First time in such a bad room! ! 
0	It’s time for the people at the front desk to attend the training class. It’s always a poker face. I’m a customer and didn’t lend you money. Why do you have to look at your face? The facilities in the room are getting old and the towels in the bathroom should be changed. Convenient for work. I will never consider staying at this price. I have stayed many times before, and I will consider changing hotels in the future. Is there any comment really useful? After staying in another hotel and leaving a comment, I will see the hotel management reply, such as Dalian Yinfan Hotel. How did Xinxietong’s reply have never been seen before, so it didn’t improve. The hotel management doesn’t even think about making progress, let alone the subordinates. 
1	XDJM who likes small animals, especially cats, should take a look, very interesting! People who don't like small animals should read it. The world of cats or animals is no different from you! 
1	"I think a good book has good writing and good stories. This series of books uses humorous words to write vivid stories, and is matched with childlike paintings. Let children and adults like it very much. I read it to him before the child can read the word. He listens happily and I am also happy to speak. It is a great book. For the little ""turtles"" who don't like to read Chinese books, their mother said that they would also like to read them, which is attractive enough. Thanks to the original author as well as the translator for their efforts. Through a good translation, we can appreciate such a good book. "
0	I just signed for it yesterday and the system has not been installed yet. I heard the sound of the fan running after a short while after turning it on, I wonder if the heat dissipation is really not good 
0	The screen performance is very general, especially the system font looks a little fuzzy after installing Vista. It is recommended to buy an HP business jet if the budget is sufficient. 
1	Very nice hotel. Dry-cleaned clothes will also indicate where there are oil spots and where the thread is open. And have done the corresponding treatment! ! ! ! Thank you very much! ! Nothing to say about the scenery, very good! The room is antique and comfortable! Will stay here next time. 
1	The room booked for a friend is said to be pretty good, so I will try it myself. 
0	The environment outside the hotel is very dirty, not only the carpet inside the hotel is black, even the tiled floor is black, too far from the city 
0	This hotel is very strange. To say it is also very careful, the details are very good, including the folding of towels into the shape of various small animals, and the rose petals in the toilet. But the service is really bad. The environment of the hotel is not good. Looking at the hotel introduction in the room, it is said that with the room card, you can get a 20% discount to play various items of Ocean World, but from the reservation to the check-out, there is no staff member to tell us this. The most outrageous thing is that I saw a mouse in the lobby! This hotel is terrible. Additional comments January 25, 2008: Forgot to say that the front desk service attitude is not only bad but also unprofessional. After checking out, I returned to the hotel and rented the hotel car to the airport (the fare is 100, which is convenient). When I asked for a room card, I clearly told them that the room card had been returned to them and confirmed that it was returned. And a check-in lady started complaining to each other. . . . I was amazed besides being surprised. . . . sweat! After I got in the car and drove out for a while, the driver was also interesting and asked me if the money had been paid (they asked me to pay the front desk, and someone came out to sign and arrange the car) and then called back to the hotel to confirm if I was right The money has already been paid. . . . Waterfall Khan!

0	A lot of the content of the article is something I haven't seen before, I have thought of it, and it is practical! But the level of the translator is really not very good, especially when it comes to person conversion that makes people dizzy. It is recommended that Dangdang can have the original (English version) to buy.

It does not support dual-channel memory, and the integrated graphics performance is also average, worse than INTEL's integrated graphics. But the heat is small. Some. The advantage is that it is cheap and cost-effective."" "
0	Conditions are too bad! The room area is too small, it is not like a 4* hotel! 
0	1. The sound effect is rough 2. The machine itself and the screen love to vacuum 3. The built-in vista home is not practical 
1	I am a junior high school math teacher. My child is in the third grade of elementary school. He often visits bookstores. There are few such good extracurricular math books. Reading this set of books with my son is a bit deep for children in the third grade of elementary school. It involves the content of junior high school and requires simple explanations. Understanding and not understanding are second, the key is to cultivate children's interest in learning mathematics. Such difficult knowledge is shown through comics and stories! it's actually very good! ! Because it is a translation, some language descriptions are a bit awkward! Why can't Chinese writers write it? Overall, very good! ! ! 
1	After reading this book, I think it is still very good, but I feel a little late. Why didn't there be such a book twenty years ago? Hope to recommend it to young people. However, having said that, I am afraid that not everyone can learn the principles inside. After all, personality is still difficult to change. In addition, some chapters of Mr. Yuan are too academic, otherwise they will be more popular and interesting! It may be related to the author's own experience, and he was enrolled in famous universities! I am very impressed! I hope to write another book for those born in the 70s. It is not easy for people who are caught in the middle at home and outside when working hard in the workplace or starting a business! 
1	"This book guides parents how to help their children get rid of negative emotions. It is a very thin book, but the sentence is classic and extremely practical, and it is highly recommended. The book was republished in 2007. The author added some new content and wrote a preface for Chinese readers. I feel that every time I read this book, there will be new gains, because the children are growing up and the parents' hearts are constantly maturing. Many concepts and methods in the book need to be digested continuously in the long practice. If your child is almost 2 years old, or has shown signs of ""Terrible Two"", be sure to study this book quickly. "
0	When it is discovered that the motherboard is a problem, the replacement time has passed. I strongly recommend that you do not buy things with high after-sales requirements, especially computers. You will have to buy the system for a long time and you will not give away other things. It seems that the price is a bit cheaper than outside. 
1	I have read most of the articles. When I bought it at the time, I wanted to see if there were any good-looking photos in it. Unfortunately, they were all in black and white. The color photos would be better. As for what I said, Wen Qing's pillow book is a bit past, I think. It can be seen that the work done by the author for the interview is really onerous. I bought it for more than 20 yuan. After reading it, I threw it aside, and I might be able to use it as historical data that day. All in all it's fine, but not as good as I thought. 
0	Although it is a work of a fellow villager, it is still a bit far-fetched from an objective point of view. Although the author has a rich experience and a good literary style, he does not like the structure and style. This time I followed the trend and made the mistake: ( 
1	1. The font is not that small, 10 inches is just that there are fewer things displayed on the page, and the font has not become smaller. 2. Lightweight and good speed 3. The hard disk is large enough 
1	This is a very useful tool book. Especially under the premise of current economic globalization, China's financial institutions are still weak and financial products are relatively scarce. Of course, taking into account the factors of the financial turmoil, the introduction of financial derivatives and the corresponding supervision must be cautious. However, since you can't give up because of choking, even if it is to prevent risks, you must learn more about the management process of mature financial institutions in the world, so this book is a more classic choice. 
0	Very remote, road construction outside, very messy, rooms are ok, service is average 
1	I stayed at the hotel on August 1st. I came to Hong Kong mainly for SHOPPING. So in terms of location, the hotel is in a relatively biased location, but I feel worthy of the price I booked at HKD550/night. The room is very clean and I have The semi-sea view room you stayed in can really see a wide sea view. It feels very good. The bathroom is very spacious and very comfortable. The only thing that is lacking is the TV, which is placed on the side of the bed, which does not seem very convenient, but it is okay , Anyway, it’s not for watching TV. In terms of traffic, I didn’t encounter any major problems. It’s just that I went back and forth to Sheung Wan, Central, and the hotel many times that day. I felt that the hotel was a bit far away from the shopping spots. Generally speaking, I went out from the hotel to see it. It provides SHUTTLEBUS at the time of departure to the MTR station (ie Central Station) and then transfers to Sheung Wan and then transfers to the tram (commonly known as Dingding). Because there are sea views along the road, it feels very pleasant. I have one more thing to add to the reservation: it must be booked early, I have been comparing prices before choosing to start on August 1 (of course, those days or the animation festival will kill two birds with one stone), and then I approached 8/1 and checked At that time, the price has become more than 1,000, the hotel is the price of seafood so I have a deep understanding. 
1	Very light, almost no noise, even the sound of hard disk spinning is almost inaudible. Configure the mainstream, tested with related software, the cpu temperature is only 39 in such hot weather today. The workmanship is very delicate, and the appearance is not said, which makes people feel like they can't put it down. It is indeed a rare notebook. 
0	After a business trip from Xuzhou to Xiamen, I originally wanted to relax, because I arrived at 9 o’clock in the evening, so I booked a superior room. It doesn’t matter what the front desk service is. I got the room card and opened the door. It was completely different from the Ctrip picture. Typical decoration in the 90s, it doesn't matter, I only stay for one night and it will be done. After all, the fruit that was placed in the room in advance told me that it was a Ctrip customer, but the waiter who came after changed my mind. She told me straightforwardly that the front desk asked her to remove the fruit, asked the reason, and sent it wrong. That's it, but there are fruit drinks on the Ctrip website. I was embarrassed. I called Ctrip and the customer commissioner would coordinate. When the final feedback came to me, the front desk simply didn’t know that I was a Ctrip customer and didn’t know me. It is a Ctrip guest. How does he know that the room booked is a superior room? How does he know when I will arrive? I don't know if our clothes are improperly dressed, or whether we come from a small place and this problem is caused by the negligence of the staff. It's a pity, I originally wanted to go to 1912, so I got out of the mood and went to bed early. (Later I refused to apologize for the lobby manager, upgrade the room, late check-out, etc., to protest my dissatisfaction a little) I think next time I go to Nanjing, I will carefully consider my choice. 
0	The service was very bad. When I checked in at the front desk on the first day, because of doubts about the pre-authorized signature, the receptionist told me that if you don’t want to sign, please ask someone else to pay for you (this answer is simply letting people) Speechless)! When I checked out the next day, I used another credit card to check out. The pre-authorization of the card used for the deposit cannot be unfrozen. It will take 10 to 15 days to inform. According to the front desk theory, you must see the duty manager and the notice will take 15 days to arrive. It can be thawed in one month. Later, I called to ask and was told it would take 45 days. I was surprised to call the bank and learned that if the hotel did not do anything, it would naturally thaw for at least 45 days. If you want to unfreeze in advance, you must fax the hotel to the bank. I feel very angry about their explanations and their handling. Such hotels can still get 4 stars and the service is too poor. Whether it is software or hardware, the improvement of hardware can cost money, and the improvement of personnel quality is costly. Money can't buy it. 
0	On April 25, booked by Ctrip, stayed at the West Building of Sichuan Hotel. After arriving, the clerk at the front desk said that there was no reservation, but he still checked in smoothly because the price at the front desk was the same as that of Ctrip. This hotel is not easy to find. The Sichuan Hotel is divided into the main building, the south building and the west building. The three buildings are far apart. It took a long time for a taxi to find it. The reason why I chose this place is that people's comments on the Internet are relatively high, and it is relatively quiet and close to the business district. But the problem came at night. My room was facing the street. There was a group of people drinking at the night market downstairs. The glass in the room was seriously not soundproof. It was noisy until three o'clock and I didn't sleep well. I went to Mount Emei on the second day and returned on the 27th. I still plan to live here because the room facilities are relatively clean. I specifically emphasized to the front desk that I wanted a quiet room facing in, but I did not expect that a new and bigger problem appeared again. The noise of the air conditioner or boiler outside the room made people’s ears extremely uncomfortable, let alone sleeping Up. After enduring 12 o'clock, I called the front desk to inquire, and was told that it was the sound of the air conditioner, but the air conditioner of this hotel was turned off, and the air conditioner of another hotel next door was still ringing, and they could not help it. She offered to change a room, but she had no choice but to clean up the things spread out one by one, and then change to a room facing the street. This time it was okay. No one was making noise downstairs, but the bathroom smelled off, and the room was full of smells. I really didn't want to toss about it anymore, so I put the soap my mother was carrying on the bedside to resist it a little. Alas, in short, the Sichuan Bin West Building is very uncomfortable this time. I need to stay in Chengdu for another two days when I return to Chengdu on the 1st. This time I definitely can’t stay again and change hotels! 
1	Absolutely super cost-effective, perfect screen, absolutely sufficient for daily office, good appearance, high-end machine is definitely misunderstood by others 
1	More than two years ago, I saw many reports of Operation Red Wing on the Internet. I didn't expect that this book would have a Chinese version, and it would be so well written, of course, thanks to the good level of translation. The American soldier who grew up on Marcus this farm wrote very simple and humorous articles. I thought that the two parts of recruit training and childhood experience would be the least interesting to me. I didn’t expect all things to be described so vividly by him. He has a good memory, and he looks like watching a movie. The article has a strong sense of picture. . My advice is, no matter how much you think you know about SEALs, don’t miss this book! 
1	"From ""Dream of Xiaoran"" to ""The Prime Minister of Youth"", it is impossible not to say that Xiao Yi's essays can always touch people and shock people. Whether it is Qi Ran’s devotion or Yi Han’s dedication, the heroine is not as fortunate as in other articles. The author always seems to play the role of stepmother, setting various tribulations for her to grow, let People are pleased to see it. Who can say no? Rainbow is always after the storm, and people grow up in constant tempering. The only difference is that they have different goals and become different people in society. Seeing Linyu's growth, pain, and happiness, I am also happy. "
1	I am very pleased to live in such a hotel in this small western city. The free airport pick-up service provided facilitates my travel. It is located in the city center and shopping is very convenient. The breakfast is rich and the service staff are very friendly. Recommend everyone to try it too, I think I will still stay here next time I come here. Additional comments August 15, 2008: Special thanks to the room attendant. When I got a nosebleed, I sent a humidifier. I was really moved. 
1	The pre-installed linux can save a lot of money, the cost performance is good, the appearance is not bad, the warranty is three years, the delivery personnel, and the service are good 
0	The content of the book is rather rigid, and you will find it boring if you read it. It should still be ok in terms of application. 
1	The environment is very good, the garden is large, the service ecology is also very good, it is very close to the airport and very convenient, not bad, consider staying again next time 
1	The room facilities are a bit dated. The good news is that the broadband speed is okay. Hotel Feedback January 14, 2008: Thank you for your recognition of our broadband, we will also work hard in other aspects, welcome to visit us again! 
1	I like the bathroom in the room most. Big bathtub. There is also a shower in the bathtub. very convenient. The separate shower room is also very spacious. Will choose in the future 
1	People who have experienced car accidents will have some shadows in their hearts. I have a deep understanding of this... Xiao Li must belong to the type of people whose shadows have not disappeared, so the reaction to the freehand not wearing seat belts is so intense ! It's so pitiful, but it's still unclear. So, I thought this guy who didn't smile was moody and moody. It was really miserable! 
1	High cost performance. After IBM was acquired, it changed from an aristocratic machine to a popular machine. Everyone can enjoy the addiction.

1	The notebook looks very good. Although it is a vista system, it still feels very fast 
1	The price is too favorable. Other brand netbooks have the same configuration, the same appearance, but the price is different. This one is actually 1000-1500 yuan cheaper than other brands, which is too good value. It is the price of the copybook and the quality of the branded machine. 
1	To be honest, when I bought this book, I just thought it was cheap. When I bought it, my goodness, I am a person of blood type B, and what it says is exactly the same as mine. I was thinking about how this is happening. A Japanese book is amazing. It seems that there is a certain reason for the blood type to determine the personality. Although the book is a bit shorter and thinner, I think if you are also a person of blood type B, you should really watch it. People like us who always feel that others don’t understand themselves, reading this book is really like meeting a soulmate. , Haha Today I bought a blood type A book for my friend again. Haoshu strongly recommend it.

Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! Sure enough, it is another preaching essay! 
0	I bought this book because it was very hot, I stayed on the list for a long time, and because of my personal love of literature and history. However, when it came time to watch it, I felt disappointed. Of course, this is more related to personal hobbies. I don't like its language style very much and lack a sense of reality. However, it has been lingering on the list for so long, and perhaps its attractiveness, but I haven’t found it yet. 
1	The stuff was very good. It was delivered at half past six in the evening. I guess I will be the last one. The look is very beautiful, the appearance of the mirror screen design is currently in use. 
0	As soon as I saw the beginning, I couldn't stand it anymore. Her narrative style made me feel like a junior high school student. I just flipped through it and threw it aside. 
1	"After reading ""Tibetan Code 2"", I couldn't help feeling the richness of the author's imagination and knowledge. From ""Tibetan Code 1"" to ""Tibetan Code 2"", it is like a 360-degree turn, turning us from the beautiful and mysterious snowy plateau to the thrilling and equally secret American continent. Seeing the experience of Zhuo Muqiangba and others, I was really impressed by their courage and courage. This is a thrilling and exciting trip. Regarding the experience and fate of Zhuo Muqiangba and others, I really sweated for them. I hope ""Tibetan Code 3"" can let me see the fate of the characters in my heart. Expect…… "
0	The facilities are not bad, but a guest house. My towel was hung in the bathroom, and when I needed it, I found bed bugs crawling on it. Can only throw it away. The restaurant price is also high, a scrambled egg with green onions costs 25 yuan, other dishes can be imagined. The location is good, the service attitude is okay, and you can swipe your card all the way. 
1	The two words of education seem to be simple, as simple as daily authoritarian education. So the child becomes the growth carrier of the parents' wishes and personal preference. Many times parents do not think about whether the child is willing? So children can only passively enjoy indoctrination. For thousands of years, we have faced this concept as usual. This kind of education is worthy of our reflection. Recommend such a book to all parents and those who will become parents. Of course, this book is not only about the above topics. Let us learn and try to have a better future for our children and love our children! 
0	By the way, the previous thing that said that the key-insertion needs to be photographed to work is not new. I do this every time. The most funny thing is that I unplugged the card and the power was still on. Construction is underway at the back of the building, bulldozers, pile drivers, cars, and the shouting of workers, the scene is too strong! Do not rest at night. The front desk team was indeed crying and crying. They called the assistant manager of the lobby at different times just like they owed her 800 bucks. No one ever answered. 
0	The quality of the book is good, but it feels that the layout is not very reasonable. After opening, it feels very messy and dense. Children don't like it. 
0	The price is too expensive, the room is still too small, sometimes the air conditioner is not turned on, and the toilet in the room is broken 
0	"One word----""Great disappointment""!!! Before I went to Guangzhou, I studied on Ctrip for a long time, and then I chose Elan at the request of my husband because of the ""CHINA----lonely planet"" he brought from Europe. I recommended this hotel with perfect words. Looking at the pictures and introduction online, I think it should be good (no reviews). I thought it should be similar to the level of ""One Family"". But when I entered the room, I found that the picture is really good The difference is too far. The room is very small, there is no place to put luggage, there is even no place to sit. A very small writing desk has a very small ""LCD TV"". If you want to lie in bed and watch TV, I'm afraid You need a pair of clairvoyance; if you want to use that desk, you must be very slim to sit in that position, and you need to bring a laptop smaller than 12 inches, otherwise you can’t put it down. The room is not clean, first of all The 330 yuan double bed room I entered, there was still hair floating in the toilet. Later, I immediately changed to a 560 yuan suite, which is actually a little bigger, with more sitting space, sofa and table and bigger Ordinary TV. The room facilities are very old, some parts of the floor have been turned up, sound insulation is not good, and the hot water pressure is not enough... The front desk service is not bad, the waiter can speak English; but I did not see the baggage at all. Personally, it is not worth the price; personal opinion, it is not recommended to stay! "
1	I recommended this book to my colleague before I finished reading it, and my colleague couldn't read it and bought another one. I arranged a free time and space for myself, sat down and watched it seriously for an afternoon, drew a lot of lines on the book with colored pens, and recommended it to my husband. In general, the benefits are great, and many principles and points of getting along in marriage are worth learning. The book is a short story, the author incarnate as Mr. Zimu or Mrs. Zimu to give analysis comments and suggestions, it is worth seeing. 
1	The location of the hotel is good, but it is a bit noisy near the road, because the windows are not double-layered and the waiters are more enthusiastic. At that time, an electric kettle was quickly delivered to the room. It is recommended that the hotel pay attention to the cleanliness of the pillowcases 
0	The XP driver is a little troublesome. The built-in driver disk and XP driver basically have it, but there is no wireless network card. It was very complicated to pretend, and it took all afternoon to get the problem solved. In addition, the drivers under XP are installed manually and cannot be installed automatically. 
0	Stayed more than a month ago. Very impressed. The exterior of the hotel looks very good. The inside is pretty average. What impressed me was that my butt started to itch on the second day. It made me go to see the doctor. Fortunately. No problem. Maybe the quilt was not cleaned. There are bacteria on it. It must not be disinfected. It is impossible to change the quilt. I suggest that you stay more expensive in the future. Don’t be greedy for cheap. It’s only one or two hundred fast Things. As we went to Dongguan to live in Haiyue later, it was very good. More than 500 nights. The rooms are big. Very new. The environment is also very good. The attitude of the waiters is also very good. In short, everything is very good. Very satisfied. Very good value. I believe Haiyue in Shenzhen will not be bad. I dare not live with 3 stars and 4 stars now. Hey, don't worry. 
1	"The quality of the book is very good, very interesting. My daughter is 2 and a half years old. She really likes it. Every day she goes home from get off work, she pulls me and sticks stickers. The picture is very warm, casual and lively and interesting painting style, adults and children like it and the language expression used for the question makes the child respond at once. Every time I finish reading the question, ""Let's paste...""! The daughter replied loudly ""Okay"" and then seriously looked for the target! Although the posts are crooked and crooked, but I am very happy to play and look very fulfilling! Great! ! "
0	The hotel is relatively old, and the sea view room is also very general. The slippers of the hotel are said to be not disposable, but it is not stated on the package, and you will need to charge 10 yuan per pair! I did not find this slippers compared with other five-star hotels What’s the most significant difference! I’m really sorry to charge for the slippers for such a low cost-effective room rate! So you have to be prepared that the slippers can’t get wet and dirty during your stay, which means charging! Maybe the hotel will justly give you environmental reasons ! I won’t live again next time, I really don’t see any particularly comfortable place! You can try Haiyue Jianguo again! Anyway, the sea view room of this hotel is not interesting! And the room is quite average! The service is nothing to be praised Yes! It's definitely not even comparable to the Zunhua Ramada in Tai'an, although Tai'an is a small place! 
0	1. The surface is not easy to wipe after touching by hand 2. The pre-installed system starts too slowly 3. The original package is a bit thin, and it will bulge up with a little decoration 4. The price does not include a mouse, which is suspected of multi-view ticket sales 
1	In Linyi, this hotel is relatively high-end, and the service for foreign guests is also relatively qualified. Unfortunately, TV content is relatively monotonous, and there are few foreign channels. Service attitude is good. 
0	It's too realistic. I think there should be a snack machine. It is not good to take money seriously. People should live in a simpler life, not even if they are rich and powerful, the most important thing in life is to learn how to live an optimistic life. 
0	In Nanyang, I am still the only one in Nanyang. I have no choice. Of course, I have to choose when I go for the second time. I hope that Ctrip will work hard to add other hotels in Nanyang. The price of Golden Hyatt Oriental is too expensive, which is too far from the price level of Nanyang. Moreover, the rooms reserved for Ctrip are all leftovers around the corner. I am really annoyed. I always have the feeling of being held down by others. I can't find a sense of God. In short, bad! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Service, bad! ! ! ! ! ! 
0	1. Fingerprints and traces can be easily left on the piano paint surface; 2. The touch pad design under the keyboard feels a bit wide; 3. The interfaces on the left and right sides are dug out on a slope, which makes it uncomfortable. Other acceptable 
1	The heat dissipation is great! Graphics card! Playing games is not stuck at all. Fingerprints provide a lot of privacy. 
1	In those years when humanity was annihilated, Li Guangtou and his brothers depended on each other for their lives, and forged a family relationship that was not related to each other, but had the same siblings, and the blood was thicker than water. In the second half of the novel, after Li Guangtou became yellow, he still can’t forget the brothers The brotherly love is definitely closely related to this experience. The charm of the brothers lies in the authenticity and deep emotional description, but there are many pornographic clips, such as Li bald peeking at his butt, hosting the beauty contest, Li bald and Lin Hong’s description of sexual relations, how should I treat the large number of sexual descriptions in the book, I think it’s worth exploring 
0	The disadvantage is that it is too difficult for girls to install the system. Others are really nothing. You can only buy a small book. You choose ASUS and you will not regret it! ! ! 
1	1. Fully functional, stylish and atmospheric 2. Without VISTA, you can install your favorite OS 
1	"I feel very tired recently, so I bought a few books to read. When I first read the first few chapters of the book ""The Road Few People Walk"", I felt that my mood suddenly became brighter, relaxed a lot, and I had confidence in work and life. With the reading of the next few chapters, I feel that there are many places in this book: the words are not clarified, and I feel that the author always explains half of the problem, and then goes on to explain the next question. However, the overall feeling is still very exciting and can inspire life. When there is time to read it again, the ancients said: Learn the new through reviewing the past~~~~ "
1	The weight is light enough, the 13-inch screen is just right, and it is uncomfortable to look at it small, the appearance is good, the performance is decent, plus 1G memory for two or three years should be no problem. 
0	What kind of broken hotel is that? Ctrip also recommends it. The service was extremely poor. I moved into 708, the door of the room was made of paper, and the water in the washbasin was broken. Ask the waiter, the hotel was renovated 10 years ago, and Ctrip introduced it was renovated in 2006. The breakfast quality is very poor, the waiter's service attitude is also very poor, I don't want a spoon. There was no plate even after eating. In fact, I feel the worst is Ctrip’s service. I recommended an unverified false information to a diamond VIP, and then asked the customer to ignore it and let the customer find a place to live in a strange city by themselves. Until January 1, 2008 There was no feedback on the complaint, but I can understand it because the Ctrip staff handling the matter is on vacation. As for what kind of opinion the customer has, haha, let's talk about it after the holiday. Goodbye Ctrip. Hotel Feedback January 2, 2008: Thank you for your valuable comments to our hotel. We apologize for the dissatisfaction you experienced during your stay in our hotel. Our hotel opened in 1998 and has been operated by installments since then. The floor has been renovated, and it is known for a variety of room types for guests to choose from, such as special standard rooms suitable for business guests (mostly large beds, new in 2006), family rooms suitable for couples traveling with children, and ordinary large beds Wait. Regarding the catering, it is indeed due to our negligence in management. It is not until the Spring Festival. It is very difficult to recruit workers. I hope that we can understand it. However, this is not a reason. We must strengthen training and improve employee customer awareness. As an apology to you, we will We will reduce your room rate for the day and give you a gift to apologize. We look forward to your visit again! 
0	It is purely the style and quality of the state-owned enterprise guest house. The whole hotel looks rather old. 
1	"When Zheng Chou didn't know how to communicate learning problems with his children, a friend recommended this book! When I carefully tasted the content, I suddenly found that many of the other examples were experienced when I was a child. Fortunately, I have not been led away by those counterexamples. It can also be said that my child is lucky! There are many kinds of sayings in one sentence, but the meaning and taste of each saying and tone are different. The positive examples in this book are compared with the negative examples, so that you can learn to ""speak"". I have read it twice. The main task is to read the book thinly, and then read it for the third time! "
1	Is it a so-so 3-star hotel? The location is OK, very close to the square. But the surrounding environment is too bad and very noisy. And there is no taxi at the door, which makes it inconvenient to go out. 
1	"As a workplace apocalypse, it’s not true that there is no introduction to victory story like Du Lala, but it also tells you in a relaxed way how to survive in the workplace and how to climb higher and higher, portrayed with concise and clear graphics. The ""workplace helium"" needed in the workplace makes people eager to try. As for why it is called ""Starbucks Workplace Revelation"", I personally think that there is a bit of suspicion of advertising in it, and it does not seem to have much to do with STARBUCKS. , You need to keep trying "
0	The room is too small, there is no elevator, the surrounding environment is ok, but the road is being built, it is very noisy 
1	Books are very good and cost-effective. It looks like nv's graphics card is not as strong as ATI. The main reason is that Intel has less heat 
1	Is it a so-so 3-star hotel? The location is OK, very close to the square. But the surrounding environment is too bad and very noisy. And there is no taxi at the door, which makes it inconvenient to go out. 
1	The overall price/performance ratio is pretty good. Insufficient: There are too few USB ports, close enough, and still on the left! Trouble trouble. . . Summary: The overall price/performance ratio is pretty good, alas! My friend said that he would like to wait until 2999 to notify him to buy it. . . 
1	It's lighter. After upgrading to 667 bus, it is faster than 533. The pre-installed system is xp3. 
1	The battery really lasted for more than nine hours of standby, and it was used for about seven hours. rare. The workmanship is fine, the battery design is reasonable, and the keyboard typing is relatively smooth, perhaps because of my small hands. The microphone reception is not bad. In addition to the so-called 3G, the functions are relatively complete, even if the quality is average, at least it has the functions as a second computer, portable enough, of course, except for the optical drive, and the game is free. Regarding the problem of small words, it can just limit your online time, which is also an advantage, haha. 
1	"After I read the book written by Chenchen, I felt that he was a relatively introverted and slow-heated person. He wrote all his true feelings in it, and it also made me understand how Chenchen came along. Hard and not easy. It also made me understand that Chenchen’s journey is not only supported by Le Oranges, but also Aunt Wei and Uncle Wei who care about and support Chenchen more than Le Cheng. In their hearts, their son is the best! Not only I read this book, but even my parents read it. They all said, ""It's not easy for this child to get to this point today!"" They also asked me to learn from Chenchen! This book is worth reading! "
0	AMD platform, the performance is still good, but the fan is really loud, if you play games, the fan will always be ringing, it may be that the quality of the fan is also average, a lot louder than the fan of my Toshiba M301, and the heat is good Well, the air outlet is at the back, but it feels like hot air will blow to the lower part of the screen 
0	The price is a bit expensive, the hard drive is not quiet enough when it is turned on, it is okay in operation, and the right palm rest is slightly hot. VISTA is too rubbish, not as good as XP. 
0	The fan sound is not small and intermittent; this machine does not have a small line of touch screen on the power button, please pay attention to purchase; the speaker is average, my dorm girl bought a Toshiba, the sound effect is not as good as hers, but the overall comparison Mine is much more beautiful, haha, it is very comforting 
1	The books are not bad, the screen has no bright spots, and the heat dissipation effect is very good! The shell material also appears to be very upscale. 
0	When the delivery confirmation sheet is signed, please confirm whether the parts are complete and so on. But the delivery person said that there is no need to dismantle, they only care whether the goods are right, and they don't care if there are missing items. So I signed it directly. Although there is really nothing missing in the disassembly, if there is a case, it is hard to say. 
0	The external environment is good, but the room is too old, and the balcony door must be covered with something to sleep at night. The price is not high. 
0	The service is terrible, there is not even a pair of slippers in the dignified five-star hotel room, which is not as good as an ordinary small hotel. 
0	The driver under xp is a problem. Some hotkeys cannot be used and the sound is not good. It is said that it is a driver problem. I don’t know what to do? The screen effect is average, if only led is good, the production date of the screen inspection is the first week of 2006. 
0	It feels a bit thick in the hand, and the screen will slosh with the vibration, and it feels like it is not strong. The left hand rests, after a few minutes, it is obviously warmer than the right. 
0	Although the character style is like small balls, it lacks the exaggeration or humor that should be a comic. The primary school diary, which is more like an illustration, is hard to resonate. 
0	The fan makes a loud noise when it is turned on and after it is turned off. There is no system and drive disk. It would be nice if it could be done in one step. 
1	Lala 1 bought it a long time ago. The first time I read it is to watch the excitement and the plot; when I read it again, I have already marked up the key points of the workplace listed in the book. In fact, this book is intended to summarize the author's experience and skills in the workplace, but the cleverness lies in her combining all the dogmas into a vivid story and creating a vivid white-collar image. The difference between Lala 2 and 1 is that the story in 1 is more ups and downs, while 2 is more focused on the summary of workplace experience. In short, while it is a good book, it can teach us many things. 
1	"It vividly depicts the life and mental state of children. I think many of Apollin’s behaviors are exactly the same as those of his son. After reading the dressing book, my son often shouted when he took off his hedging clothes: ""How big is my head!"" It was really funny. It can be seen that the author did observe the child's behavior very carefully. However, Apollin is a girl, and she has many actions that are closer to the state of a girl, so I think it should be more suitable for girls to read. "
1	I stayed at the hotel on August 1st. I came to Hong Kong mainly for SHOPPING. So in terms of location, the hotel is in a relatively biased location, but I feel worthy of the price I booked at HKD550/night. The room is very clean and I have The semi-sea view room you stayed in can really see a wide sea view. It feels very good. The bathroom is very spacious and very comfortable. The only thing that is lacking is the TV, which is placed on the side of the bed, which does not seem very convenient, but it is okay , Anyway, it’s not for watching TV. In terms of traffic, I didn’t encounter any major problems. It’s just that I went back and forth to Sheung Wan, Central, and the hotel many times that day. I felt that the hotel was a bit far away from the shopping spots. Generally speaking, I went out from the hotel to see it. It provides SHUTTLEBUS at the time of departure to the MTR station (ie Central Station) and then transfers to Sheung Wan and then transfers to the tram (commonly known as Dingding). Because there are sea views along the road, it feels very pleasant. I have one more thing to add to the reservation: it must be booked early, I have been comparing prices before choosing to start on August 1 (of course, those days or the animation festival will kill two birds with one stone), and then I approached 8/1 and checked At that time, the price has become more than 1,000, the hotel is the price of seafood so I have a deep understanding. 
1	Generally speaking, it feels good for Xiamen Hotel. We booked a double bed room (15th floor) and a twin room (11th floor) in Building 8 for a total of 6 nights. The room is relatively spacious with a little hardware facility It is outdated. For example, the light switch control feels not very convenient and intelligent, and other aspects are good. The waiters are polite, well-trained, and warm and enthusiastic. The breakfast variety is quite rich. I personally like the noodle paste. Duck meat porridge. The milk and soy milk tasted weak when I first went, and it improved significantly after giving comments. The Chinese food on the 3rd floor was done very well, and the private room service was very good. We were a very young waiter that day, but very attentive Thoughtful and appropriate. The surrounding environment is very good. Building 3 is the Thai consulate. The transportation is convenient, and the taxi to the ferry is 8 yuan + 1 yuan fuel. In short, I feel that the hotel is better than the service and environment. In contrast, the 6 to Lujiang Hotel I have used two meals on the floor, which may be due to the good business.Some waiters are very impatient and stiff, which makes people feel very uncomfortable, although the snacks are well done. 
1	I bought a set of those things in the Ming Dynasty. I have seen the sixth book. It is enjoyable and super enjoyable. This is the best-looking and best-understood history. If all history is written in this language, I think the most The students who are happy should be the students. It should be a few years earlier. Learning history would not be a painful thing, especially if the author himself can walk into history and analyze the people and events of the time from multiple angles. These things happened right beside me, and I felt like I was there, not bad! Pretty good@ 
1	I have stayed in the field covered by this book for more than five years. The college describes the industry as good as this, very good! On the other hand, I was relieved that I had forgotten how many business courses I learned when I was in university, ha ha. It is really difficult for college students not to combine with practice. The current students are at least living in the information age, and they can open a series of websites involved and print the knowledge points in the certificate. But even so, I believe it is relatively limited:) 
0	I really don’t like this kind of little woman living a life that she thinks of being a petty bourgeoisie. Every time she thinks of the scene of Shanghai at night, it is not very comfortable, only a decadent feeling. 
1	In general, this book is just like the male lead Abe Seimei, flat and calm. The FEEL is very comfortable and warm without strong winds and waves. Some are just the romantic feelings under the cherry trees in the afternoon! The hostess is not as capable and smart as she is lazy! But not annoying. There will be some hilarious words and thoughts in the article, but because it is so plain, I can't remember the content of the book a bit, and I am not impressed. The author's writing is good, the characters are well portrayed, and he does not deviate from Abe's original character. Is it an absolute clear water article? 
1	Recommendation: Zhu Yuanzhang is an emperor who has exerted his imperial power to the extreme, but I think it has something to do with his experience.Although he is smart and clever since he was young, he doesn't read much and has experienced ups and downs, which has developed his complicated character , Calm, tough, violent, suspicious, the greater the power, the more exposed. 
1	This notebook microphone can be matched with Philips computer microphone SHM1000? 
1	The hotel is an older four-star hotel with outdated facilities, small rooms, and a bad health scale. The overall feeling is average, but the price is still based on the new four-star, so it feels not very worthwhile. 
0	My daughter doesn’t like it very much. I bought it from the introduction and thought it should be good, but when I took it, the story was not very interesting, and the cartoon image was average and dull. My daughter seemed to be a little enthusiastic only when she first bought it. There was no enthusiasm when I opened it. It may be caused by different cultures, it is best-selling abroad, ha ha. In comparison, my daughter still likes the Dudu Bear series very much. There is a question that must be mentioned, which is more offensive. As children’s books, especially children’s books, can publishers control the quality of the ink. The price of this book is very high. Even if it is in children’s books, the smell of the ink is still so choking and too big. I think it's smoky, and children will be willing to take it! I put it in the living room for a week before the taste can basically be seen. Isn’t it too much to print children’s books with this ink? 
0	The standard room is too bad. The room is not as good as the 3-star and the facilities are very outdated. It is recommended that the hotel improve the old standard room. 
1	"My son is 17 months old and he bought a few baby bear picture books with the idea of trying it out, including this book ""Take It Up"". The son likes to read it very much. There are many toys in the book, which are the same as his son's. Kindly, after the first time I told him, my son didn't hear enough, but he said it 5 times before turning off the lights and going to sleep. And through this story, my son is still willing to pack up his toys. It’s useless to tell him before. After reading this book, my son and I said, “Didn’t you tell me the little bear? If you don’t play, I will put it away next time. Play again!"" As a result, the son tidyed up the toys very cooperatively. "
0	The memory is a bit smaller, but now the memory is cheap! The operating system needs to be reinstalled; cup amd often moves and the stability is not as good as intel; but I rarely move it; type integrated graphics; the fan sounds very loud; Linux system is very troublesome to change windows 
1	Nice hotel, good location, just out of the train station. The first floor is a bit noisy, there are tour groups and guests for dinner, but it does not affect the accommodation 
1	High cost performance, good workmanship. The fever is better than expected. Reached the level required by general computers. 
1	It seems like staying for the second time, this time the standard room environment is not good, the room does not feel clean, the TV is not good 
0	The pick-up service was not bad. The hotel called for a taxi to take us back to the hotel. At seven o'clock in the morning of the next day, the next room was actually under construction with a percussion drill. It was too bad! I will definitely not live next time! 
1	With curiosity and anxiety, I started to read this book about weight loss written by LULU. At the beginning, it resonated strongly with myself. . . Unlike many weight loss books. . . LULU uses her own personal experience to tell us how she changed herself. And it also allows us to see the hope of weight loss success from the picture. I think this book is worth reading for all girls who love beauty. . . Whether you are slim or not, you can follow the method in the book to make yourself more beautiful. . . So I recommend this book. 
0	The heat dissipation of the notebook is relatively poor, and the temperature rises to 80 when the game is on, which is terrible! ! There is a serious shrinkage of the battery, and the battery life is over 1 hour! 
0	The accessories are a little bit less, basically just an optical machine, the remote control that used to be equipped with Y430 is also gone, and I didn’t even find the small mouse that others said on the Internet... 
0	Most women want to meet a man who loves them infatuatedly, no matter how they treat him, he will not leave. . . I think this is just YY. Why can the selfish, radical and always suspicious heroine treat the actor as he pleases, and the actor still loves her so much? I can only say that there is no reason for love, a bit silly~@~ 
0	Dangdang is well advertised on the Internet, but the content has no practical significance, and there is no new knowledge and ideas learned from the book. The quality of the book is not good, you can just look at it after you buy it. 
0	It was found to be as wide as the 12-inch X61! depressed! Wireless encryption does not support WPA2! ! ! ! ! ! Very depressed, I am playing remote networking and network security! Cracking WEP and WPA is not difficult now! I thought that netbooks are very fashionable, but I didn't expect some built-in things to be so bad! 
1	Marriott’s hotel hardware facilities should be quite good, just because of the Spring Festival stay, it looks very deserted, almost no other guests. Most of the supporting facilities are also closed, except for the fitness center. The female cleaners of the fitness center are actually right The guest asked where the slippers and bath towels fell on deaf ears, and replied that you were looking for it yourself. You could not find it. So my daughter went through the long aisle with bare feet and only wore a bathing suit to enter the pool. In addition to being cold, it was indecent. .unacceptable. 
1	The shell is beautiful, and the actual product is 320G, which is larger than the introduced 250G, and the price is affordable. It also has a high-definition interface. 
1	The LINUX system is quite disgusting. I don’t know what the idea of this dog day is to force us to use it. I bought two computers. One VISTA system. One is LINUX. I didn’t see an XP online sales. The most important thing is to fight as much as possible. Don't involve after-sales service. Try to do it well. In fact, online after-sales service is worse than no after-sales service. My THINKPAD SL400 is because I thought it was a small keyboard problem during the replacement period and I didn’t bother to change it. 
0	I stayed in the West Building on October 24. The room is very spacious, but the facilities are older. Its room has two doors. This is rare, so it is very quiet at night and the sound in the corridor will be much smaller. The same price at the time, if you go Look for it on the nearby pedestrian street and there will be surprises. Fortunately, there is still a TV signal. It was a coincidence that Chang'e was launched that day. 
0	No Bluetooth, no paper instructions, although I want it to be useless, but if you give it away, people should need it 
0	I bought it for a friend, and I read it roughly. I like the one written by Teacher Qu Limin better, but my friend likes it very much. The biggest advantage of this book is that there is a set of human acupoint maps 
0	I placed an order on November 7th and November 9th. The order placed on November 9th was received on November 20th, but the order placed on November 7th has not been received until today. I don’t know what it is. Going on 
0	"It's not 4 stars at all, I don't know who rated it. The front desk service attitude was very poor. When checking in, the lady at the front desk had already had a dispute with the two guests in front, and she was not sorry for her attitude, and she chilled me for 10 minutes, and asked the other lady why she didn’t give it to me To register, her reason was ""I thought you were with them"" dizzy. . . The room cost is 768/night, which is far from the room facilities. There is not even a brighter chandelier. It is all dim headlights, which makes the mood very depressed. The soundproofing facilities are also too poor. At 6 o'clock in the morning, the traffic on the road was so noisy that I could not sleep. The so-called breakfast, I really don’t know how to describe it. There are only a few in total, and there are only 2 to 3 things that can be eaten. The waiter in the restaurant is more interesting. I don’t know if it’s over enthusiasm. You are still eating, but the plate There is not much left in it, so they always come to collect your bowls and don't ask if you still need them. It feels like there are fewer plates in the kitchen and they are eager to recycle them. In short, whether it is facilities or services, there are only 3 stars. "
0	This VISTA is too uncomfortable to use, and there are so many messy things pre-installed, I don’t know what to leave~~~ It’s too much trouble to change XP. 
0	I didn't even receive the goods, and later I didn't know who I could find to solve it. I just gave the money for nothing, but didn't receive anything, what should I do 
1	"After choosing for a while, I finally decided to buy this 541. Needless to say, the performance of the business machine is ok. In addition, I am a loyal user of hp. The hp2205 purchased in early 2006 is still in service. It is difficult to install the xp driver. It is recommended that the purchaser use the ""driver wizard"" software to solve the complicated driver when modifying the system "
1	The front desk service is very good and attentive, but the hardware facilities are aging because they can't keep up. 
1	I watched the first two parts of the trilogy before the New Year, and I felt it was just average, I just bought it because I wanted to finish watching the last part of the trilogy. However, after reading it, I think this is the best written in the three sets of books, and it is also quite good among the novels I have read. The character portrays are fuller, and the plot is also very turbulent. The ending is not bad, everyone can do what they want. However, the image of the heroine created by the author hasn't changed much. They are all deliberate and will not harm others. It is very different from the previous popular court novels. This is good. 
0	When I first read, I still felt that it was good, and I felt that the contrast between the front and the back was too great, just like the experience of Hutton, a girl who only went to junior high school! 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the weight is relatively light, and the sound is very small in operation, and it should not affect others when used at night. The bag is very strong and easy to use. The screen looks more delicate. 
1	I went for the reputation of Marriott, but I was a bit disappointed. Apart from the good location of the hotel, the other performances were mediocre, especially the decoration of the room. I hope the hotel authority will update it soon, otherwise I am very sorry for the more than 800 nights. The room price (no breakfast yet). 
1	The rooms are clean and comfortable, and are ideal for business trips and vacations. The service industry is very good.

1	In fact, I have watched this TV series on the Internet a long time ago. Later, I heard that there was a discrepancy between other people’s stories and the Internet, and then I tried to buy a book and read it. After reading it, I thought it was better. There is a feeling, a more imaginative space, unlike the filming on TV, the actors picked too rubbish, the filming is not realistic, perfunctory Yes, I like this book very much, if you want to read it, Don't watch TV, it will be a big discount in your heart. Although the plot of this book is relatively simple, it really moved people later and taught me to cherish the people around me who love me. . . 
0	1 Pre-installed VISTA, it is troublesome to change XP, need to re-partition 2 The partition is unreasonable, the recovery partition will default to the C drive primary partition when the system is installed 3 There is no recovery disc, and one-key restoration is not available after re-partitioning. It would be better to change to a matte surface 
0	Too far from imagination. The content is just to see, there is not much connotation. If you can, only a 2k word press release can explain the problem. 
1	This book is a good book. The author has really experienced many places and spent a lot of time writing it. The authenticity is very strong, and it writes Chinese cities well. I personally know very little about the culture of the city. , So I don’t understand many places when I read it. This is related to my personal level. Some people say that the author of this book is biased, but I think the author is not biased at all. Really, he did not deliberately talk about the mainland and Hong Kong. Good thing, the opinions written are very real. 
0	The black border is too big, the screen can be bigger, there is no optical drive, the Rising is still the CD version, the memory stick needs to be installed by yourself, the vista system is too difficult to use, and it is not compatible with many software. It is not convenient without a touchpad. There is only one partition, which is a bit depressing. 
1	I feel that the male protagonist is a very deep person, always smiling so seemingly harmless. It is estimated that the female protagonist is dizzy. The more so, the more curious the female protagonist wants to approach. People are like this. It’s getting bigger. 
1	I have seen reports on this book in many places, so after I bought it and read it, I thought it was worth it. The two books focused on different aspects. The first one gave me the feeling that it was a tough Dura. Pull, encountering any difficulties will not make her regress, always insist on what she wants, and work hard for it. The second book seems to be teaching methods of doing things, giving people a kind of wisdom. Although it is a book about the workplace, it has not brought me many aspects. At least it has changed my mentality recently and decided to take the postgraduate entrance examination. Because it is strange, so brave. 
1	The room is large and the attitude of the waiter is very good. It's just that the mall is attracting investment, which is not very convenient! 
1	Checked in on July 10th, because the hotel is engaged in activities, so the original 700 room is only 498 yuan. It is quite cost-effective. The location is good. The room is also good. However, if the original price is more than 700, it is a bit expensive. Overall still satisfied of. 
1	Unlike other business management books, the author tells you in the form of a novel what you should do, what should not be done, how to do it, and what the scale is. It’s clear and logical, and there is no feeling that Lao Tzu teaches his son. Experience the storm and grow up with the protagonist. What the author says is also self-explanatory. It is easy to accept and does not cause resistance. A good book on how to be an employee. However, the author’s description of love is a bit cumbersome. After reading the whole article, I don’t know when Lala fell in love with Wang Wei. I was a little disappointed~ 
0	Let's start with the parking lot. There is no security guard. The parking lot is free to enter and exit. It feels like parking the car on the open space on the side of the road. There is no sense of security at all. When I entered the hotel lobby, there was a pungent musty smell, and the red carpet was so dirty that it almost turned black. The first feeling after entering the room is that it was thrown into the basement by others. Even this room dare to be called a deluxe room? ? Immediately after the request to check out was refused, the hotel offered to change my room, saying it was a more luxurious room, but the result was still,,,,, but fortunately, the window can be opened, so I opened the window to sleep for a while, My bath towels actually have a peculiar smell (musty smell). I really don’t know what mentality Ctrip signed with such a hotel. Is it because of the price? ? ? It's close to four hundred, which is also called cheap? ? ? I advise everyone not to live here. The only thing that can be counted in the past is that the service attitude is pretty good. 
1	In many cases, we cannot say no to our parents and family education. Because our parents cannot choose, so family education can only bear. Even if there are many questions, they can only accept it silently. However, as grown-up adults, we can perceive, introspect, and reflect on the problems in the education of our parents. Teacher Wu's book allows us to read more clearly and understand. Through this book, let us grow up and treat our next generation in a truly good way of education, and believe that they will grow healthier and happier. This is the enlightenment this book can give you and me. A good book. 
0	The hotel is very general, the facilities are very old, the location is relatively biased, seriously does not meet the price 
1	I thought that the workmanship of the book at this price would not be any better, but when I got it, the workmanship was really good, at least better than the 5k dell. . . Performance is decent. . . 
0	I bought this book because I read a lot of good reviews. Although I don’t have much money, I’ve never been a person who spends money in a random manner, especially if I am interested in a lot of flowers. This book is a special case. . I really don’t understand why so many people give good reviews. It seems that everyone’s requirements for books are too low these days, and you can write books as individuals! Forcing myself to read most of the contents of this book, I still didn’t get any substantive things. Now it’s a time-consuming society. Even if I wasted my money, I can’t waste my precious life anymore! It's not big anymore. This book is like a chicken rib. A dear guy said it is good, hype, yes, it is hype, and it is very exciting. The above is purely personal humble opinion, for reference only! 
1	After reading this book for a long time, perhaps the bits and pieces in the book happened in the history of our ancestors. Family history is something that no one of us can forget. The words and deeds of our parents have a profound impact on future generations. It can be said that the prototype of my ancestors is highlighted in this book. In an era of turbulent changes, how can we go better and how we can make the family prosperous, this is worthy of every one of us to ponder, think about the destiny of the family, and think about our own destiny. What kind of life journey is what we want. 
0	The hotel facilities are outdated, the waiters are stiff, and the location is relatively remote. 
1	"This is a good book. Just because at least it emits a free sound. I just received it today, I can’t wait to start reading. After reading the first article: Song Qiang's ""Internal Affairs ""Angry"" that Must Be Faced"", it is comforting to know that there are editors and TV producers who are in charge. At the same time of consolation, now I no longer hear the hymns of ""events"" in the TV news; I see the presence of national leaders at the CPPCC meetings; I understand that there are finally voices of opposition in the various votes, not always Passed unanimously. "
1	Compared to other brands, I prefer the black, frosted shell, which has a good texture and is not easy to leave fingerprints. Needless to say, heat dissipation is very ok! I personally like the pre-installed VISTA, but the compatibility is too poor, so I can only change to XP! 
0	Fooled, each article is very short, it looks very unsatisfactory, it just feels like it is over. But later I learned that Zhang Ailing’s articles are in this style. 
1	The attitude is good, but the service is almost inadequate, the other is nothing~~~~~~ Supplementary comment April 4, 2008: The service staff spoke very badly, saying that the problem arranged by Ctrip has nothing to do with them~ 
1	This is the first book in this series. I have read the whole series (at least until now). I admire the author for such a large structure, and now there are not many people who can write such novels. Of course, the author is also relatively clever. The stories are said one by one. The context is clear and not like some famous works. It is mixed and cumbersome, and often expresses too many confusing. Xin Yiwu's work should be regarded as a model of youth literature. It can be said that the writing style of the article is solid and old, the content is easy to digest with the slick content, and the finishing touch is easy to come by. Great book! 
0	The order placed at 17:25:00 on May 3, 2009 was delivered only a week in Tianjin. The order was written on JD.com. However, I asked the third-party delivery company that the headquarters found. The attitude was bad. Why not mention it 
0	1. The keyboard feels average. 2. In fact, the machine is quite thick, and it is also very heavy, not very light. 3. There are two wireless network drivers in the machine's built-in driver disk, but they can't be installed. The model is wrong. You can install it after surfing the Internet! The random software is too sloppy~! ! 
0	After hearing many friends talk about this book, I am also attracted by the name of the book. It's nothing more than buying it back and looking at it. Many opinions are contrary to my own. It may be that the national conditions are different and cannot be copied completely. In short, it is much worse than expected, a bit disappointed. 
1	I booked the VIP building standard room (selected according to previous reviews). The biggest feature is that the service details are considered very thoughtful. Fruits, evening papers, napkin boxes, and even the stepping towels in front of the bathtub are laid out. Special note: Because the standard room of the VIP building of this hotel is close to the road, the rooms are divided into double-layer soundproof glass room and single-layer soundproof glass room. If you are sensitive to noise, it is recommended to book a double-layer soundproof glass room. 
1	Haha, after receiving the computer, first reinstall XP. It takes four hours. Remember to turn off SATA in the motherboard BIOS first. After installing xp, you still have to shut it down, otherwise xp won't get in. Of 
1	"The baby is one year old and nine months old. It has been a month since I bought this set of books. The baby likes it very much. This book gives me the feeling that it is very exquisite and the content is also set according to some basic life of the child, such as ""I'm going to pull a baba"" and ""The Car is Coming"" are very good. The only regret is that because the author is Japanese, there is a little bit of content that does not fit our situation. For example, in the book ""I'm Going To Brush My Teeth"", Xiao Hippo and others eat sushi. There is also a big shopping mall in ""The Car Is Coming"". When it comes to going to amusement parks and eating children's meals, I don't think junk food should be promoted too much. "
1	In all, I bought 78 IBM notebooks on JD. This configuration has improved performance while ensuring very high cost performance, excellent heat dissipation and a perfect screen. The company’s colleagues are also very satisfied with it. The keyboard is absolutely comfortable to use. 
1	Julie’s life has suddenly shifted from the bustling social world to the tired and boring orphanage in the eyes of others. The people she faces have also shifted from the sleek adults to the helpless children, her intimacy The spouse changes from an attractive and successful man in everyone’s eyes to a rigid and uninteresting doctor. The changes, the mood swings and the ups and downs are difficult to explain in a few words, but in this book, the author can use children. The plain language speaks clearly, and it is natural and reasonable to make people accept these changes, and the skill is extraordinary. 
1	Good book! Slightly larger than the 3.5 mobile hard disk, much smaller than the standard notebook. Between the two, but better than the two! ! The authoritative administrator answered that the consultation was full of errors, and the consultation 6 times still misled me to buy one more memory! Fortunately, Jingdong is good! ! Unconditional return! ! Love Jingdong! Attacking irresponsible answers~~Haha, thank you Jingdong! Enriched my life! ! 
1	It is an introductory method. The author uses certain methods, especially fund management, to enforce self-operation discipline, so as to overcome the weakness of human nature, and to carry out the transaction, remember that it is a long-term process. I think it is necessary and the method is also effective. For the management of funds. The book does not explain some of the trading points very systematically, but it can be said to be a guide for everyone. In particular, the content of the first part is the basic knowledge necessary for market participation. The trading system still depends on everyone to explore slowly. Improve the odds of entering the game. Returning to the essence of the problem, the management of funds is important. 
0	Seriously regretted it and decided not to buy these books in the future. Of course, I am not going to buy it for myself. It's all nonsense, just like the rise of a great power now boiling 
1	Special offer, perfect screen, exquisite appearance and workmanship details, looks very atmospheric, worthy of thinkpad 
1	This is the third review, purely for points. There is nothing more to say, the service is good. 
0	It’s a bit heavy, and it’s too tiring to carry on to and from get off work; there is also the system, which is really annoying, just a C drive partition, I have found many ways to partition, but the system is still broken and the backup is not done. used. NND only has to get the service point, and it has to spend two hundred dollars to change the system. 
1	It was originally bought to learn and educate children, but after reading it, I always unconsciously compare it with the adults around me. Because the theory in the article has been verified by reality, I feel that China's education really needs improvement. Of course, it is in the existing Absorb more fresh elements on the basis of good quality. The cases in the article can help me correctly understand this Mongolian educational concept. I hope I can use it correctly and implement it unremittingly. I hope my child’s future is better than ours. It's brighter. It would be better if the author could write books acceptable to grandparents, so that the children's life would be more unified and complete. Thank you author!! 
0	Like the title, I haven’t read the book yet. Generally speaking, the printing effect is okay. However, the whole set of books has an unpleasant smell. I don’t know what the publisher considers. This set of books is for children to read. Such a big taste may cause some irritation to the children's respiratory tract. I wonder why this book can get so many five-star reviews? ! 
1	The configuration is OK, the price is lower than the village quotation, and the price-performance ratio is quite high. The XP system was installed smoothly. 
1	The workmanship is good, the sound quality is particularly outstanding, and the touch-type volume adjustment is very cool. I did not expect such a good product at this price 
1	"This book is different from ordinary children's books. It lets children know that the ending is not all ""living together happily"". The beast will never turn back into a prince, and ""irreversible"" may also be the ending. This is a fact often encountered in life. Dahl allows children to understand the cruelty of reality, but we don't need to fall into despair because of the existence of bad facts. The meaning of life is revealed to the children in this book by Dahl: Life is used to do things that are beneficial to mankind. The strength of life does not lie in its length, but in whether you can illuminate more with your own life. s life! "
1	The performance is good, the VISTA rating reaches 4.2, and the LED screen display effect is good. 5099 to send a package and mouse, using 2000-100 coupons, equal to 4999 starting. 
0	"Four words, ""terrible"". I checked in after 11pm. The first is the inconvenience of transportation. To get to the hotel, you must take the special expressway of the Three Gorges Dam. At the same time, you have to stop and check the special pass for several armed police ""blocking stations"" passing by. Even if he showed the hotel's certificate, he would be questioned by the soldiers for a long time, because he was very upset with the child. The hotel arranged for the reception staff who specially sent us the pass and asked us to drive to the house to pick him up, and asked to send him home after completing the formalities. After tossing for a long time, I arrived at the hotel almost one o'clock in the morning. The attitude of the waiter on duty at the reception desk is even worse. "
0	This is the worst five-star hotel I have ever stayed in! I stayed in the so-called economy room on August 5, 504 yuan/night; the room was very small, and the passage was small and only allowed one leg. There is no door to the bathroom, and there is no door to the shower room. If you can't take a bath, you can quickly get out of the bathroom! Changed another room, still the same. The carpet is dirty! No service! Can't stop it! Don't live it for nothing! There is a feeling of being cut by a big knife. 
0	It was decided one day in advance, and it dropped 300 yuan the next day. It was too bad, and Jingdong didn't compensate for it. I was depressed. There is no system installed on the machine, it is not very convenient to install it yourself. 
0	The USB port on the left is too close, and the external device is bigger. They cannot be inserted at the same time. The sound of the optical drive is not so loud. Handwriting software is tasteless and useless. Express expansion card slot is not a universal type, is it a future trend. I used to buy a wireless network card and cannot use it. 
0	For unknown reasons, the space bar cannot be used normally. It can only be used when it is pressed in the middle, and there is no response when it is pressed on the left and right sides. The customer service said that it must be tested before the replacement. Lenovo customer service testing can not open a test order. To detect the folded keyboard, although it can be used back, there is always a shadow 
0	I stayed in a hotel standard room (room 203), the facilities in it can support the 2-star standard, and because there is a restaurant on the second floor, there is a kitchen in the room, which is quite disgusting 
0	The matched driver seems to be used on linux. After looking at it, this is a failure. But if you can find the driver on the official website, it's nothing. Note that the xp and vista versions are different. 
1	If you study the theory of socialism, Wei's book is very worth reading. Teacher Wei uses Marx's argument to explain our current theory of the socialist market economy stage. It is clear, rational and methodical, which will make people fully feel the superiority of socialism. Compared with other books on socialist theory, although Mr. Wei's book does not have many popular terms and theories, the whole text is compactly structured, the text is fluent, and easy to understand. The thorough analysis of Marx's theory is quite inspiring. . It is really touching to be able to study socialist theory to this level. 
0	First, there is inspiration, then the theme, and finally such a story is made up, the story is really average, and the level of some Korean dramas is about the same, it is a TV drama screenwriter. I took another look at the introduction, that the Italian award actually had a middle school student judge, and then I looked at the newspaper reviews and the development of the book, speechless. 
0	The environment is too noisy, there is karaoke at night, which affects sleep, and the service staff is poor. 
1	Triple room, the room is very spacious, the bathroom is not big, but it is very clean. The design of the alley on the third floor is very original. It’s just that breakfast ended too early. I went to the restaurant at nine o’clock to catch up with the waiter to watch the last table. There are many special snacks nearby. The small restaurant diagonally opposite the door is open more than three in the middle of the night, and the noodle soup is very delicious and cheap, but Forgot the name of the restaurant. 
0	Because this is a good book that many people say, I just bought it. Maybe it’s the Dongdong written by Yu Hua that completely contradicts my own routines. I think his writing is very bad. I personally feel that he is a little bit I imitated Wang Xiaobo, but the ability to control words is far behind, so I'm so nondescript, I regret buying this book very much.

1	High performance-price ratio, the price is very affordable, the graphics card does not say, it is very good for the notebook. 3D games run smoothly. The system is not as difficult to install as rumored. 
0	The screen is 16:9. Prefer entertainment and movies. It’s wasted to work because it’s too flat and can’t look at both sides. 
1	I saw this book when my baby was more than two months old and almost finished it in one breath. At that time, I didn't have a lot of milk, and the baby always wanted to eat. The family said that I didn't have enough milk, so I added a lot of milk powder. After reading this book, I realized that the milk is getting more and more, so I made up my mind to reduce milk powder. After less than a month, I reduced all four milk powder meals a day and became breastfeeding exclusively! And I used to feed it for four months. After reading Xiao Wu’s book, I am going to feed it until at least one year old. Now the baby is seven months old. I still insist on taking the baby to sleep and breastfeeding! I really want to thank Xiao Wu! This time I bought the book to give away some pregnant friends! 
0	The graphics card is low; the mouse buttons are a bit loose; the power port is a bit loose and easy to fall when touched; you need to reinstall the system with the system disk to give you an address, the installation is very useful http://bbs.55show.com/thread-12053-1- 1.html 
1	This book gives a brief introduction to the main content of each module in financial management. It is a good choice for getting started, but for readers who have not been in contact with SAP or ERP, it may be a little bit more difficult to understand. It will be so profound. If you can combine the actual business, then whether it is the understanding of the book, the mastery of SAP's financial management theory and its application in various industries, it will be very helpful. Of course, this is useful for beginners. Certain difficulty, after all, practice is a long process. This book is suitable for reading at any time and repeatedly. 
1	Connecting obscure theoretical knowledge in a story. Although the plot of the story is more dramatic, it can be seen that the author is to put all kinds of knowledge together and combine it to happen to a person. This prevents the reader from creating a role. Confused and not able to understand the changes from the inside to the outside of the concentric circles in the book. The author suggests that when reading this book, you can read a few chapters and then pause for the recollection. In fact, it doesn’t matter if you read it through for the first time and then repeatedly read it several times. The meaning of 
0	Because of the battery, the notebook is still heavier, heavier than the x200. Although the power supply is small, it generates a lot of heat and is hot to hold. The shell is easy to get fingerprints, it is best to stick a mold. 
0	Many people think highly of this book. I can only say that this book is not suitable for me to read. I probably browsed it and felt that the contents of the book are already known, and there is no interest in reading it without mentioning things. ~ 
1	"My son suddenly had diarrhea and vomiting when he was two months old. We sent the baby to the hospital the first time. Parents always hope that the white angel can cure the child’s disease quickly and accurately. However, two weeks have passed and there is no Significantly improved. A friend recommended this book to me, and at first I suspected that such massage would really cure the disease. With the mentality of trying it out, I gave the child a one-hour massage (according to the instructions in the book). I didn't expect it to be better the next day. I continued to massage for two more days and healed. Now I give my son massage for 1 hour every day, thanks to my ""family doctor""-Children's Meridian Manual "
0	The room is very small The room facilities are very old, because the renovation has been 10 years. The air in the room was very poor. When I opened the door, a very big smell of smoke and musty rushed toward you. The service was not bad. Although I changed from the 6th floor to the 9th floor, the air in the room was still very poor, very poor, and unacceptable! ! ! 
1	I received? Li Chuan's past? I finished reading on Saturday and re-read it from time to time on Sunday. The characters in the book and the stories that happened to the protagonist appear in front of my eyes from time to time like a beautiful and sad picture. The story of Qiu and Lichuan, that kind of heartbreaking and intoxicating love, is what every woman dreams of. I am deeply trapped in the plot of the novel, and I can’t extricate myself from it. I haven’t appreciated such a beautiful emotion for a long time. It's a novel, thank the author for making the protagonist's love have a perfect ending, so that people can sincerely bless them after they shed tears for them, and can smile for their happiness.

0	The one hanging is four stars, but the furniture and household items in the room are very poor, like the equipment in a guest house; and the TV is still placed in a cabinet like a closet. You must open the cabinet door to watch the TV, and there is no free mineral water. drink. 
1	The price is cheaper than Zhongguancun. The battery capacity is really good. It takes about 6 hours to watch the movie. I like the appearance. I personally think it looks better than NC10. The screen color is not good enough. The graphics card is really not good. When watching rmvb movies, if there are other operations, the screen will be stuck. , But it’s a netbook after all. It can be tolerated. Summary: Although it is only 10 inches, the screen font is clear, and the screen is not small at all. It is generally light and easy to carry. After a day in Zhongguancun, I didn’t find a cheaper price than this. worth buying 
0	I don’t know why everyone commented that this book is good, but I can only say it in general. At least from the perspective of a novel, the author’s literary quality is really embarrassing to compliment... 
0	The hotel’s service was very good at the time of check-in. The lobby and the room were average. After check-in, I found that the hardware of the room was poor, such as the air conditioner, toilet, especially the TV remote control, which was very poor and could hardly be used. The air conditioning in the room doesn't work, and the corridor has a smell. The breakfast was very poor. The waiter was frantically picking up things at nine o’clock, and he didn’t ask the guests if they needed it. It was very poor. The evaluation I had seen was not very accurate. I immediately moved to Longcheng the next day. Shanxi is really good. There is no good hotel, I don't know why, it's weird! 
0	The quality of the book is good, but the content is really boring. I thought it would focus on psychological analysis, but it was actually about extramarital affairs. 
0	1. It is better to use zm82 for the machine's cpu, which is more comfortable with a discrete graphics card. 2. Strongly condemn acer, the machine is out, and the driver must be updated. This motherboard adds a graphics card, because the driver problem can not form a crossfire is a waste. ATI's notebook drivers are not universal, so notebook manufacturers must release them by themselves 
1	"When I searched for ""Resurrection"" online, I saw several versions, and finally saw this one, translated by Cao Ying, and bought it without hesitation. The price is a bit more expensive, but the book is here. In the future, I still think it is worth it. This book feels heavy in my hand, and the quality of the manual is good enough. The cover is in paperback, but it is exquisite, the paper inside is great, and it feels smooth to the touch, much stronger than other versions. As for the content, the translation by Cao Ying is unnecessary. In short, this is a good book for both inside and outside! Recommend to buy! "
0	I thought it was in the same system as the Overseas Chinese Hotel in Wenzhou. When I checked in, I found that it was like a school-run hotel. The soundproofing of the room was poor, and it was not only about the left and right, but also the movement upstairs. The room had an old musty smell, and the executive room was bigger. The lake view is average, and it is a small part of the lake. Services are like state-owned enterprises. 
0	Tianyu also occupies a position and can reach the light, the internal facilities and consumables are not very good, and it is very expensive 
1	High cost performance, enough performance without playing big games, three-year warranty, good HD viewing, complete interfaces, good heat dissipation, and good workmanship. 
0	The package is not included, and the price is not advantageous. I bought it a few days earlier. If you don't count XP, the new netbooks are more cost-effective. 
1	The facilities are a bit aging, but after all, it's a place to keep quiet! The stuff for washing is quite complete! 
0	"I flipped it casually. The cover is fancy, and the font inside the book is very large, which can almost be described as ""great"". Contents, I guess I can only serve as a footrest in the future. I unanimously believe that everything that is popular, fancy, and praised by everyone requires the greatest suspicion and caution. I bought too many things this time, and the light of reason did not shine on the impulsive sensibility. I still added a burden or a tasteless to my originally small room! These two books have very high reviews in Dangdang, very good. I suspect that Dangdang entrusted the pages of these two books to pretend to be customer hype. Of course, I just doubt it. If you need to read these two books, it is recommended to borrow them in the library. It is unnecessary to buy them for collection and slowly absorb reading. This is my personal opinion. Please learn from yourself. Anyway, I bought the table legs in my house for 20 yuan. "
1	It’s good to use. The visat system is not as rubbish as it is said. Many software is installed, but the software version is higher 
0	In fact, it is the clubhouse in Tongcheng. It is located in the innermost part of Tongcheng. It takes nearly ten minutes to walk in from Beiyuan Road. Such a condition of more than 300 yuan is too expensive. Additional comments April 14, 2007: Note: I don’t know what the price is now. My guest checked in on March 11. 
1	I went for the reputation of Marriott, but I was a bit disappointed. Apart from the good location of the hotel, the other performances were mediocre, especially the decoration of the room. I hope the hotel authority will update it soon, otherwise I am very sorry for the more than 800 nights. The room price (no breakfast yet). 
0	Because my two-and-a-half-year-old son likes cars very much, after seeing everyone's comments, he bought two sets and a series of books. The first feeling I got in my hand was light and light. Although the format of the book was large, the paper was average. It is too far from its price. I opened the book and turned it around, because I bought it for this book at the time, and it was as messy and too messy as many buyers commented before. The picture is too full and the plot is not clear. The most important thing is that many cars are completely inconsistent with ours in China, such as: taxis, jeeps, and my son’s favorite pickup trucks. There is no translation in them, and they are mostly translated into small trucks or transport vehicles. It's rather confusing for him, and I'm struggling to talk about it. Maybe my child is too young for this set of books. In short, this series of books is not worth buying, and the price/performance ratio is too low. 
0	"I have bought two sets of ""Different Carmela"", because not only children love to watch it, but adults also love it. The childishness in it can awaken the most innocent side in everyone's heart. The pictures are exquisite and the language is especially suitable for children to read. My eldest nephew likes this set of books. So this year, I bought another set for my friends’ children, hoping they can grow up healthy. "
1	Stayed on March 19th, a total of two nights. Now I came up for the next review, ha ha. 1, the double bed room, although it is a more old hotel, but the cleanliness and environment are not bad! 2, service The staff are more enthusiastic, because their chargers are not available in the hotel. So in the middle of the night, they asked the front desk to send a travel charger. But the first three are not easy to use, the waiter ran up and down four or five times! But no A little bored! Finally, I repeatedly apologized to me! Great!!! 3, Western restaurant feels pretty good in terms of catering! Price and taste are not bad! As for Chinese restaurant, it feels average! The dishes have no special features, and they are more expensive! It took about 400 for a meal for one person, and I still haven't eaten enough! 4. The overall environment is very good! The greenery at the back is well done, and it feels deep and quiet! Haha 
0	This is not a completely useless book, it can still get some inspiration. The chapters are small, and the time on the bus is good~ 
1	Thank you very much for the hotel arranged by Ctrip. We are satisfied with the hotel's service. We hope that Ctrip's service will get better and better and provide better and more comprehensive services for Ctrip's VIP guests. 
0	I thought there were a lot of pictures in it. It turned out to be text. I was really not in the mood to read this kind of book. The most important thing was that there was no photo of the author. How can I be sure that she is a 31-year-old beauty? Not too convincing. 
0	The light rail Hongkou Football Stadium station is over 400 Xijiangwan Road, and the store is over 700. It is not near nor far. Arrive within the booking time, the front desk told the business room to wait about 3 hours before there is a vacancy, it is recommended to change to the standard room of the same price, so move into the standard room. The room facilities are so-so: there are two desk lamps, a writing desk and a bedside table, which are good; TV shows are a bit small, and the signal is often unclear and the picture is blurred; the window is facing the light rail, so it is a bit noisy; the wall next to the window is rotten and moldy. In addition, there was not enough hot water when taking a bath at midnight, but it returned to normal in the morning. You also need to swipe your room card to enter the corridor, and security measures are good 
0	The opening angle of the notebook is small, about 100 degrees. The color of the screen is a bit strange, light, not very gorgeous, not as good as the screen of my Sony. There is a problem with the driver. There is no detailed hardware configuration instructions, so I can only try it myself. 
0	Too far from imagination. The content is just to see, there is not much connotation. If you can, only a 2k word press release can explain the problem. 
1	I really like the outer packaging when I get the book, everything is light, light green, thin packaging, it doesn't take up any space in the bag, and it doesn't feel heavy in the hand. Looking at the beginning part, I feel that the girl's life is calm, everything is light, so close to life, so fresh and natural. I like it all the more. I like the sense of reality and the unpretentiousness. Isn't life like this? In the end, everything will be flat. This book was finally donated by me to Wuxi. Let more people read this book and feel the soberness. 
1	Continue to comment again, everything else is the same as before, but I hope the front desk service speed will be faster and give people a little more smile! Not enough affinity! Nothing else, still worth recommending! 
0	It’s really bad. I stayed a little closer to the test center for the test. Basically, there is no service. The room is dark and weird. I originally ordered a double-bed room instead of a standard room. Stayed for two days and left for one day. 
0	I don’t understand the widescreen, it is very uncomfortable to use now; the vertical distance is too narrow and the width is too wide. It is only equivalent to a 12-inch screen. The screen is too bright, and after changing the settings, you need to change it again after restarting 
1	It doesn't feel so good! The sea view is also average, I arranged a very partial sea view room! The room was upgraded, but it was a smoking room. I went back at night and found that the problem was serious. Later, an air purifier was arranged and the problem was solved. The room is large, but the shape is not good and it is not practical, so it is quite suitable for extra bed! The decoration and configuration are average, not luxurious! The shuttle bus is very convenient and the surrounding area is relatively quiet, so business! 
0	When I went to check in on the first day, the eldest sister at the front desk kept losing her face. She didn't lift her eyelids until she finished the procedures. The double room was reserved for a double room, so she had to go back to the front desk to change. The eldest sister never raised her eyes. There is no wardrobe in the room, no teabags, which makes people feel uncomfortable, but the room is very clean and free broadband. There is no bathtub in the bathroom, very few breakfast varieties, and the hotel only has an elevator, which is very inconvenient. 
0	The price is a bit higher. The CPU of the netbook is still a bit short. Pay attention to the partition when you first boot. If you want to divide the D disk, you can right click-My Computer-Disk Management-Delete Disk D-Repartition-Restart-Format-ok 
1	Stayed for one night in early April 2008. Overall it feels good, especially on the side facing Zhongshan, next to the Nanjing Museum, there are also many good things to see. The Huaiyang restaurant downstairs is a bit expensive and the dishes are average. I would like to say that I have been to Nanjing several times and I feel so good! Additional comments April 27, 2008: Remember to talk about the shortcomings, which is to ask for money online! As a five-star hotel, there is no need to be so stingy, right? 
1	I stayed at this hotel in August 2007. The environment and service are good, but there is no gift compote that Ctrip said. Although it is not a big deal, it would be better not to write it without this gift. 
1	Frankly speaking, the hotel is better than I expected. It belongs to the better category in the three-star hotel. The staff has a strong sense of service, unlike inland cities. However, Ctrip's price is not competitive enough, and the soliciting guides who meet at the train station can provide better prices (the travel companions of Lu Yu tried). 
1	Brand effect, the best notebook is IBM; large memory, large hard disk, high hard indicators; vista system, no need to reinstall the system by yourself; large screen, good visual effects for watching movies and games; also give an IBM package, no more money Buy a bag, this bag is worth one or two hundred less! 
0	I ordered seven books. There was a set of things from the Ming Dynasty. I finally received the book, but only one book by Zhu Yuanzhang was ordered by me. The other six messy books were sent to me without knowing how to call. I have been busy in the past. Outcry. I really don't know how to deal with this matter. 
1	The service is really good. I stayed after seeing the good comments of Ctrip, but it did not disappoint me. I feel that the five-star hotel has five-star service. I will choose this place next time I go to Qingdao. I have the opportunity to bring a family in the future. On holiday here, it is really pleasant, pleasant and comfortable to live here. 
1	Qingdao is an agreement on a Shangri-La. If you don’t have a room, you can live in this hotel. It feels okay. But there is still room for improvement 
0	The standard memory is two 1G Samsung memory. If both memory slots are occupied, one standard memory is wasted to upgrade. It would be better if it could be changed to a single 2G memory. Vista is not easy to use, I upgrade to 3G memory is not enough, the same cost is not as good as pre-installed XP. 
1	I've always stayed at this hotel when I come to Jiangmen for business trips, I think the price/performance ratio is ok 
0	The keystrokes of the left and right keys on the touchpad are short, which feels blunt and not suitable for girls. When the goods arrived, I found that the upper edge of the keyboard was not installed in place. After a good review, how can such a product pass the test? 
1	Another outstanding feature of Innocenti's illustrations is the variety of angles. You are like watching a movie. Each angle of view is different, which adds vividness and authenticity. In the composition, the protagonist is often arranged in the corner. You need to look for it, but in the search, you see the various styles and forms of market life. It is really a wordless textbook. Therefore, Innocenti's illustrations are magnificent pictures in themselves, which are worth savoring slowly. It is highly recommended to friends who do not like fast food reading, to friends who pursue serious work, and to friends who have high demands on illustrations. 
0	I bought it after seeing how good it was. Why didn't my daughter like it and put it aside. Wouldn't it be bigger? Daughter is 2 and a half years old~ 
1	The building is beautiful. The price is not cheap. Other general. So Sofitel sounds great. 
0	The service attitude of the hotel is pretty good, but it feels that the location is rather biased and there is no place to eat around. The breakfast didn't feel as good as before. Feedback from the hotel April 5, 2008: The hotel is only three minutes away from the city center by car, and there are many places to eat around. Welcome to the reception desk for consultation. The breakfast variety has been adjusted 
0	The function keys seem to be all upturned, which makes me feel weird. But it doesn't matter if you get used to it. 
0	The sanitation of the hotel is poor, especially after 6 o'clock in the morning, I heard two mice hissing in the bathroom, and I felt very bad. The hardware facilities did not match the price. It was disappointing and too disappointing. 
0	The r series itself is thicker, the memory is not easy to install, the first time you open it, you are afraid of it. There are too many startup software that Lenovo comes with, which affects the speed. 
1	Maybe he has read a lot of the books and materials of the Onmyoji, I really like the indifferent man, so he can clearly see the worldly eyes. So I am very interested in seeing novels about him. After seeing many people's reviews, I think it should be good. After Chong Chong got it, I read it all in one go. It's a very white-eyed little story~ it's a life sketch, it's really good. Midie’s stupid and unassuming personality is also what I like~ But after all, it’s a little regretful, and it continues to develop towards the expected ending... A little regret~ nothing more~ the novel will eventually It brings joy and warmth~ 
1	Yes, the cow’s workmanship is indeed very good. Relative to this price, this workmanship, this configuration is already very worthwhile, the screen is Samsung’s bright screen, yes, the optical drive even supports light carving, ha ha, the graphics card is 2400XT, the hardware supports HD. 
1	I bought two more sets. The mother in the community asked me to buy them for them. very good. very good. Especially the antonym, a baby who is only 1 year and 10 months old, can already figure out night and day, and can also tell why. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, it is more convenient to go to the railway station, airport, and shopping. The facilities are also very good. The price at this location is really good. If it weren't for a construction site by the side, it would be quiet for ten sessions. The attitude of the waiter is also very good, but at the checkout, because I don’t know who used the original ball pen to mark a line less than 2 cm on the inside page of the service guide. Although there was no compensation after negotiation, I was very upset. If I didn't want to check the room before check-in next time, who would dare to live in. I hope this experience will prevent the hotel’s enforcement system from becoming too rigid. Apart from this unpleasantness, it is actually worth recommending. 
1	Very good, no shortcomings, light weight, good performance, now it can be regarded as a domestic product, it is no problem to use 
1	The matte shell is the most practical, much simpler than the SL piano paint, and there will be no dirty handprints. The overall shape is very satisfactory to me. Independence DVD burning 250G hard disk is also my satisfactory configuration. 
0	When I bought this book, I had not finished reading Zhang Ailing and the book about Zhang Ailing. Just because the reviews here seem to be pretty good. It is also because I am eager to know everything about Zhang Ailing. After reading Zhang Ailing and her works about Zhang Ailing. I'm really not in the mood or interested in reading this rubbish book. Calm! Calm! Now that you have bought it, let's take a look, or look at it from another side. However, I just read a section and didn't want to read it anymore, so I left it in a corner and never wanted to touch it again. He is said to be a genius, but I think his writing is really clumsy. Talking, messy, vulgar, not knowing what to say! He piled up all the words in his pig's mind that he considered to be gorgeous, and it became a so-called gorgeous sentence. Overall evaluation: garbage 
1	When I got it, I couldn't believe it was just such a small box. Ha ha. However, it is safer to pack two boxes. It's just that the gifts outside are all wrapped in plastic. When the machine was turned on, no quality problems were found, and the dead pixels were as expected, so don't let them appear. The whole machine is intact. 
1	feels pretty good in general. The location is very central and convenient to the business district. Last time I arrived late, I also offered an upgrade. There were some problems in the coordination of the guest rooms, and there was still luggage in the room that went up, which shows that there is a problem with internal communication. If the time is early, it’s just that it’s too late, the person will always feel uncomfortable 
1	The service is good, the attitude is good, and I feel comfortable. However, the windows of the room are not soundproofed, and the noise outside is more sensitive. The location is good, the Baohe is 100 meters away. The traffic in front of the door is convenient, and it is not far from the train station and airport. Breakfast is average, lunch and dinner have not been tasted, and there are some characteristic restaurants on the street not far to the right. Will stay in the future. 
0	The photos do not match the facts. The rooms are too small. Actually, there are many hotels in Kunshan that are better than this, and the prices are cheaper. Ctrip's price has no advantage in this hotel. 
1	"I first watched the movie ""Farewell My Concubine"" before reading this book. The movie left a deep impression on me, that kind of heart-wrenching sadness...Dieyi was not wrong, but his wrong love made him pay the truth without getting rewarded. The original novel is slightly different from the movie. The novel is more detailed. PS: ① The description of that period in this book is very vivid, I suggest you read it. ② The plot of the original book is closer to ""reality"". But I like the ending of the movie more than the indifferent kind. ""Green Snake"" is currently being read... "
0	1. There is a bright spot in the middle of the screen and a bright spot in the lower right. I heard that the highlights of Area A are unconditionally replaced, and I am applying for replacement, waiting for the processing result, and the progress is updated at any time! 2. The machine is a little leaky, and it feels tingling on the hand. 3. It took a day to install XP. 
0	The content is very general, not very useful for learning English words. And I feel that the author is full of nonsense, with no connotation at all! The illustration inside is also a blind drawing! I really regret buying this book! (Digression: I don’t know why, in the process of reading this book, I always feel that the author of this book is playing hooligans in the name of writing the book, and the content in it is not good! Not suitable for students to read!) It only represents a personal point of view... 
0	"I think this hotel should be one of the worst and worst four-star hotels I have ever stayed in. First of all, the smell of moldy carpets in the aisle will definitely make you dizzy before the room enters (I live on the 7th floor, and there is a manager's room on that floor. Did they have a broken nose?) Secondly, after entering the door, they were ceiling The moldy gray wall covering was shocked. This is also a hotel. It should be a guest house. The bathroom is pretty good, the independent glass shower room is very advanced, but I can't sleep in the shower room. Again, the soundproofing is super, super poor, and the people next door have very ordinary phone calls, which makes me feel that there is no wall. Every morning, the manager’s room, duty room, and waiter on the opposite side would close the door with great strength and then have a lively conversation. This experience of being stunned at 7:30 in the morning really gave me a headache... Finally, after the checkout , I have to pack some things in bags, politely ask the front desk mm, can I have a handbag? mm just checked out for me and said, you are all checked out! I... dizzy..., hold back, ask, what should I do, I can’t get my things, I have to go to the airport...mm ""You go to the room to get it"" I ""Eh... but I just gave you the room card ""...Finally I went to a floor casually, and asked the floor attendant for a handbag... I have nothing to say about this hotel... I am going to Harbin again tomorrow, but I won’t choose Post if I’m killed. Hotel Feedback July 27, 2007: We apologize for the unsatisfactory that happened during your stay at the hotel. The hotel will enhance floor ventilation during the rainy season to keep it cool and dry, and reserve enough spare handbags in the concierge. In addition, the hotel will also strengthen inspections to maximize the quiet environment on the floor. Finally, we sincerely welcome you to stay again and feel our improvements. "
0	The hotel is clean, the rooms are good, breakfast is average, but the surrounding environment is not good, basically there is no place to eat. 
1	The hotel is the same standard, the price is a little bit expensive! The overall feeling is okay, the location is very convenient, our company people live there every time they go! The buffet is good! The snack square next to it... can be spent! 
1	Free upgrade to executive room, stay here every time you go. The equipment and space are first-class in Hong Kong 
1	The book was sent to the company. Several colleagues saw it and bought it the next day. He was very interested in bringing it back to his son. This time, he bought 7 sets of books, more than a dozen books, this is his favorite, and there are also a few books. I watched it several times. I also think it’s good to let children know that there is a division of labor in this society, and everyone is doing their own work. After reading this book, he is more sensible than before. He knows that he has to go to school, he has to work when he grows up, earn money, and buy good things for his parents! I am so happy to hear him say that. 
0	There are too few accessories, no mouse and bag to match, so it needs to be purchased separately, which is too troublesome. Also, the delivery service to the countryside is not very satisfactory. The other is that the customer service phone cannot be made at all. 
0	"The Skerry Golden Childhood series is really good, I have bought all 4 albums. The child liked it very much, and I cried for it the night I forced it away. The pictures are very rich, and the text is much more than ordinary picture books. , So I personally think it is suitable for parent-child reading for big babies. My child is just two and a half years old. The entire 4 albums are reserved until she is older. The first and third albums arrived together and showed them to the children. Every day, I must watch ""Lun Lun Lun Zhuan"", <<Busy and Busy Town>>, and the third series all 3 books. I like to find golden bugs. Then one day I took her to the post office and she said that there were some in her book. Sometimes. I really have to admire the children's memory! "
1	The appearance is handsome and exquisite, the display lights are rich, the configuration is reasonable, the score under VISTA is 5.1, the graphics card is strong at 5.9; the various modules are complete, the camera Bluetooth is more practical, and the sound effect is really good; I am also satisfied with the heat dissipation problem that everyone has paid attention to. Beijing is so hot. I used it for half a day. Compared with my classmates’ computers, the heat is not as obvious as theirs. Personally, I don’t think people may listen to one-sided complaints from some people. Lenovo is still a trusted brand; it’s easy to install the system. The VISTA driver CD is included, and the XP version can be downloaded from the official website. 
0	The hotel equipment is average, the bedroom in the suite can't access the Internet, you have to go to the living room. Don't eat in the restaurant of the hotel. The price is expensive and the attitude is very poor. The dishes served are cold, and the rice served is cold. Asking them to warm up even argue with us! ! Will definitely not live next time! 
0	It is indeed hot near the right palm rest. Also, the displayed color feels a bit weird, and I did not adjust it properly after adjusting it. Very bright, but not very natural. 
1	I knew that Taiwan had such a book, but there were almost no books related to the mainland. We know too little about the various problems of the house. Buying a house is not like buying a piece of clothes. Although not all things in the book can be operated, because some require professional equipment or something, it is enough to let me know a lot of common sense about house and health. This kind of book is still rare in China, and it is very meaningful for people who want to maintain their health, especially those with babies at home. The book is also very beautiful, at least it doesn't tire your eyes. Satisfied! 
0	1. No Bluetooth. There is a Bluetooth program on the desktop, but a dialog box pops up after clicking it, saying that there is no Bluetooth module! 2. XPH has not been installed, some settings need to be done for the first startup. 3. When I entered the wireless network password for the first time, it rebooted inexplicably. 4. The screen is okay, but it is too small and the eyes are laborious. 
1	The hotel is a bit old but the rooms are clean, and the rooms on the upper floors are quiet. If you go to Datong next time, you will live again. 
0	Although the latest N280CPU is used, the chipset uses 945, which is a pity. If you can get the latest G40, it would be better. However, if you get the G40, it may be out of favor at this price! 
1	The advantage is the LED screen, the workmanship is OK, there are many function keys, and it is equipped with Bluetooth. Surprise! I have used a lot of laptops, and the sound of this runtime is still relatively small 
0	On the first day of use, I found that the power button needs to be pressed twice to start the machine. I thought that the new computer needs to be run-in. I don’t know that it’s still the case after nearly four months of use. When I got it to the repair center, the maintenance staff found it to be normal. I opened the panel and saw that the internal parts were just like the old ones. It was suspected that the old machine was refurbished. Lose confidence. 
1	The quality is not bad, the mold workmanship is very beautiful, the LED screen display effect is good, it looks very comfortable, the cpu is great, and it also has an hdmi interface. 
0	"I regret buying this book. I feel that it is not the author's own opinions and experience, but a piece of cake. Feeling like vomiting. (Why is there no ""anger"" option for mood index?) "
0	I have stayed in a lot of hotels, and I usually don’t comment on it. This time I really can’t help it. Many problems need to be reflected: 1. The geographical location and landmarks are not obvious. The driver has been looking for a long time, so I won’t say more about this. 2 .At the door of the hotel, the concierge didn’t help with luggage, (Okay! Take it yourself.) 3. Check in for 20 minutes, the longest time since the beginning, (a bit of a fire) 4. There is a corridor in the guest room The smell, it should not be newly renovated. There is also a smell in the room, which is really unbearable. 5. The hotel staff looked at me as if they had seen a ghost, and each of them would not say hello. Or they would just ignore it, and more I saw the concierge staff cocked their feet on the hotel’s public phone to make a call. (Spoken) Although it is not a star-rated hotel, the equipment is poor and tolerable, but the hotel management and serves can’t keep up, so it’s not competitive. Next time I live in Beijing Home Inn will never stay in this hotel anymore. 
1	This book was recommended by a friend. After I bought it, I picked it up and read it all in one go. It's not like some composition books make people want to sleep. This book is very easy to understand, vivid, and eloquent. It is suitable for parents to read and study composition with their children. In his writing, the composition is not a headache, it is not a pile of gorgeous words, it is not a deliberate fabrication (and these are common problems of children). The writer Xiao Fuxing used his own experience to tell us how to write the composition. The composition comes from life, the true feeling is the soul of the composition, etc. It is very touching and beneficial to read! 
0	The overall workmanship is one grade lower than that of IBM, keyboard keystrokes are short, and feedback is insufficient. I miss the IBM keyboard. The D shell is made like a toy. The piano paint is an out-and-out fingerprint collector. The appearance is too fashionable and not stable enough for IBM to be suitable for business activities. 
0	I just bought it after reading the reviews. After reading a book, I can’t feel that it is good. I don’t think it is suitable for Chinese babies. And my son is only 8 months old. Wait for him to be older. 
0	I wonder if it was her daughter who wrote this book! Very naive writing, very silly pen, very boring words, even if you have to write in the toilet several times a day, I think either the author is sick, or Japan is sick! ! ! I really can't tolerate this kind of thing, I bought this book for nothing! ! ! But one advantage is to teach children how to read 
1	The hotel is great value. You don’t need 300 yuan to live in a standard room. The room is very clean and comfortable. 
0	Old hotel, poor service, restaurant rubbish! Cheating! Can't highly recommend it! Supplementary comment September 30, 2006: Deceptive behavior: press the foot on the ground floor, and after pressing it, tell me it is 30 minutes an hour, and then add 38 people to soak the medicine, and massage the head without asking people. It's another 30 people, but it takes three minutes before and after the head massage! Deceptive behavior: renting a local car back to Beijing cost me 300 yuan! Poor service: I was driven out of the lobby when I went to the restaurant on the second floor. The reason was that there was a banquet in the lobby. The problem was that it was past 7 o'clock at that time. I was alone in the entire lobby except for the five or six waiters who were discussing gossip! Finally rushed to a small box, the TV said that it was broken, and that there was no remote control, and then there was no like this, no like that. Poor service: power outage from 12 to 4 without any notice. I asked and said it was to replace the device. . . . . . . . . . In short, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in especially the service! Upon inquiring, it turned out to be opened by the local transportation bureau, no wonder! 
0	This set of books was introduced by others. I went home and shared the content of the story with my 3-year-old daughter. The more my daughter listened, the more I loved it. Now we will use the dialogue in the story to play games at home, which is really good. 
1	Marco Aurelius’s meditations can calm people’s minds and see through many things. It can affect your way of thinking, and your thoughts are suddenly opened up. In many cases, there is a feeling of enlightenment and awakening. The Stoic school of Marco Aurelius is a branch of the philosophical school. You don't have to agree with it all, we can only absorb the essence, the part that allows the soul to be sublimated. In the bilingual bilingual collection, you can sometimes read the meditations, sometimes in English. I can learn a lot of English vocabulary and grammar. 
0	Although the hotel and service in Hefei are relatively poor and understandable, I have never seen such a poor service and hotel facilities! It is also four-star, and it is not as good as the small hotel on the street! The quality of the waiter and the lobby manager is extremely low! The room is simply The garbage room was built, and the hotel also said that the room booked through Ctrip is this kind of room, and it is still the worst. Either it is booked at the front desk of the hotel, and the room rate is much better...Halo! Strongly condemn this The approach of the hotel! Resolutely will not stay at the hotel again! There is a post hotel next to the train station. 
1	The quality of thinkpad is still guaranteed, but there is a real gap compared with the original ibm. Jingdong's price is relatively affordable. The logistics speed is also ideal. 
0	"I also chose it after reading the reviews. After I went there, I felt the same as the guy upstairs. I really don’t know if those who say the hotel is good are entrusted or the hotel’s childcare. First of all, any lake view room can only see a little bit Lake view (if it is called lake view), second, the room is slightly better than Samsung, not big, and third, the traffic is very inconvenient. The strangest thing is the lake view standard room I booked on Ctrip. When I came to the hotel, I was told that the standard room is a double-bed room, and I am not gay. Why do I need a double-bed? Not to mention that I will ask Ctrip if I need it. Because I am going to a meeting, they said to give me a double-bed room first. I changed the room with two beds. When I thought about getting angry, I told Ctrip that I would not be able to live. Who knew the hotel said that I entered the room and had to pay a day’s rent. Hey: Are you stealing money? I went in less than ten Minutes, there was a power outage for five minutes. What's more, it’s all your problems! In addition, the hotel lobby is super soil, it is recommended to live in Marco Polo or Monarch Lakeside Hotel Apartment (available on Baidu) Additional review September 24, 2007: ~{ N@Iz<dC;SP4rI(8I>;~},~{SPM77""~},~{:\6qPD~}.~{2;R*H%~}!~{IO51~} "
1	The appearance is good, and the XP drivers are available on the official website. It took two hours to reinstall the xp, basically the speed is no problem. The sound quality is good. 
0	The online reviews are good, but the actual situation is not satisfactory. It is about the level of 2-3 stars~~ In general, the price is not high! 
1	The quality of HP's brand should be considered, but it is cheaper and more advantageous. I have made many comparisons before buying. The final choice of 541, although there are fewer fancy things, but they are more practical and powerful. U, 2G of memory, independent display, all configurations mentioned in the regulations, 
0	What makes people angry is that the book I bought has 17 pages missing! ! After contacting the after-sales service, I refused to deal with it because I did not find out within the replacement time specified by them within half a month! Let me find a publishing house. The funny thing is that people said that the book Dangdang sold didn't come from them at all. They couldn't be responsible for the book. How much would you lose even if you changed one? Dangdang’s after-sales service makes me feel very regretful. Different problems should be treated flexibly and just focus on the dozen yuan. How to do it well for a long time? Remind everyone, when you buy things, especially books, you must be careful. When you buy something, you must read the next page first. (This is Dangdang’s post-sales trick). Don’t be like me. It seems you have to go to a regular bookstore. Buy a regular one 
1	XP installation is relatively smooth, but a friend said that CF is more card, I tried it and more card, I don’t know if it is the reason for the driver 
1	The computer has nothing to say, it is very good and powerful. The problem is that when I installed the driver for XP, I went to the official website and downloaded the latest XP driver. As a result, the sound card was installed and there was sound. Then I installed the graphics card. After installing the graphics card, the computer There was no sound. I reinstalled the system four times today, and I was so depressed,,, the third time I found that the graphics card driver conflicted with the sound card driver, and then I downloaded the previous graphics card driver on the official website, and finally got it done without conflict. 
1	I saw this book at my sister’s house and I fell in love with it immediately! Because the content is so interesting! After I bought it, I read it to my two-and-a-half-year-old son. The son kept giggling, because there are many laughs in the book. For example, the little earthworm makes the spider laugh, and the spider falls to the ground because of the laughter too much; for example, the little earthworm’s sister always looks in the mirror because of her beauty, and the little earthworm says when she sees it: No matter how you take a photo, your face will always be in harmony. When your ass looks the same, my son laughs even harder. It's so funny, buy it for your child! 
1	"I thought this set of books was too young for my nearly five-year-old son, but I liked it very much, so I bought it and gave it to a friend's child without reading it. I didn't expect the child to like it very much. Although the story does not seem to be special and the reason is very simple, the child’s knowledge of the truth cannot be truly understood after hearing it. This set of books is of great help to my child and his mother. And the story is first person speaking in the child's tone and perspective, the child is more likely to resonate. Especially the painting is also expressed from the perspective of children. When I read ""Tom Lost"" to him, I couldn't help my eyes getting wet. "
1	The dense mood grew wildly into a deep blue forest, and only me was wandering in and out. In addition to patience, but patience, I saw my heart blooming, decayed, and decadent lonely in the dark night. After exhausting my youth, I have been asking what love is, even now, ten years later, I still don’t understand. We are still alive, you are still next to me, you can touch, and you can snuggle. This is not the whole of life, but it makes us addicted to life. Why ask again, the word that neither you nor I said before, cold and warm are only perceived by the body from now on. (Copy) 
0	Qingdao is now recruiting a group of volunteers to find the wrong language in public places and goods. I think these volunteers may also be able to publish books! How can such books help people who learn English! Don't call me <笑死我的 English Book>, just call it <Laughing Dead Book>! 
0	The location of the hotel is good, it is convenient to get in and out of West Street; the viewing room is the view of West Street, although it is noisy at night, it will basically not affect sleep; opposite the hotel is the 99 bike shop on Ctrip. It is convenient to pick up the car. If you have paid for the reservation through Ctrip, you still need to collect a key deposit of 200 yuan; there is no elevator, and the bellman can provide luggage to the room; the room is relatively old, the carpet is very dirty, there are many spots, and there is a musty smell, and the bathroom There will be a sewage smell. When I first entered the door, I found an oversized lychee pit by the bed. It can be seen that the cleaning was too rushed and not very attentive. The big bed was too hard and the comfort was low; there were often mosquitoes wandering in the room. After playing in the next day and returning to the room, I saw a spider web under the lamp, which shows that the hygiene quality is really...not high. In general, the geographical environment is okay, and the hardware facilities are too poor. The breakfast variety is very small, there is no freshly cooked food, and the ingredients are not timely. If the requirements are not high, it is still ok to eat. 
1	It is a classic! Nearly a quarter of the speeches are worth reading as literary works, not to mention that this book gives us a more true understanding of the war that brought the Greek world to decline. Thucydides cherishes ink like gold, almost every word, which is in stark contrast with the luxuriant and complicated narrative of Herodotus. In ancient Greece, both Herodotus and Thucydides’ works were read as literary works at the Olympia Games. It is a pity that historians do not read such works. 
1	Lightweight, good hand feel, strong button flexibility, ball damping is a little bit big, can prevent misoperation ~ gift, it is great to be able to send a genuine IBM mouse! 
1	Now the child is still young and can't read, but I read it with gusto. Very imaginative pictures, bright colors. Simple words have a strong rhythm. Some people say that these books don't know what to say, and the preface does not follow. In fact, they are reading this book with a conservative Chinese mindset, and they have only read the Chinese part of the book. It is recommended to read the English part, and you can understand it with a little English foundation. I now read some rhyming sentences to my child. He is more interested, but more interested in the pictures in the book. 
1	1. Low price, enough configuration for girlfriend 2. Good heat dissipation, low noise 3. Easy to install memory 4. Perfect screen 
0	A strong personality makes people not so comfortable. I don't like it personally. If everyone should follow this as an example, then the workplace becomes terrible. 
0	Objectively speaking, this is a terrible hotel of the same grade that I have stayed in. Both the overall environment and the room facilities are as bad as a critic said. I don't want to say more, I won't go here in the future! Supplementary comment May 31, 2008: I forgot one thing just now, it is not vomiting, it is the lady who serves at the front desk of this hotel. When I went to check in, it seemed that I owed her much Little, that ignorant look almost forced me to find their boss! 
0	1. Installation is more troublesome and requires professionals! 2. There is a triple MSI three-pack certificate in the case. It says that the purchase date and the dealer's stamp are required to carry out the warranty. But what I see is three blanks. Does it affect the warranty? 
0	I stayed at the hotel on July 4, the room was old, the disposable paper slippers were rotten, the bathroom mirror lamp was dug out, the cord was exposed outside, it looked bad, the shower lotus fell off when touched , I can only use one hand to wash, the floor leaks... I had breakfast the next morning. After a long wait, the hotel’s breakfast soy milk was gone, because the breakfast turned out to be takeaway. This was the first time I heard. Originally I told the front desk to postpone check-out until a little bit, but when the waiter came to check the room, I was only ten minutes late to the front desk to complete the formalities. I actually had to charge half a day’s room fee, and the front desk said the waiter asked. No one wants to check out. It’s the guest’s problem and almost fainted. The final solution is to charge an additional one-third of the room charge. I don’t know if this hotel has a high degree of arbitrariness in the settlement of room charges. , Because he was anxious to go out to do errands and did not continue the theory. In short, I strongly urge everyone not to stay in this so-called international hotel, which is really bad! Hotel feedback July 25, 2008: Dear customer: Hello! After reading your comments on the hotel, our management staff can’t calm down for a long time. First of all, we want to thank you for your comments. The so-called hotel’s growth is based on listening to customers’ feelings and opinions, but the hotel’s operations are formal. The procedures are very important to every guest staying in our hotel 
1	The environment is really good, facing the sea, quiet, suitable for leisure and vacation, but unfortunately only stayed for one night. The location is relatively biased and it is more convenient to drive by car. Hotel dining is too expensive, I drove out to eat. 
0	After listening to the introduction, I want to use this book to make up for some bad translation habits in English. Obviously, after reading this book, the content of this book is too shallow for people who have finished high school English. The pictures in the examples in it seem to be screenshots from the Internet. . In addition, I bought a lot of books because the quality of this book was defective, and the spine of the book was crushed. It was so troublesome to apply for a book exchange. The ridiculous thing was that the application for rejection was so simple that it was crazy. Quietly waiting for the book back... 
1	Good quality and stylish appearance! The configuration is reasonable and there is basically no bottleneck. The LED screen display effect is good. The 13-inch size is just right and easy to carry. 
1	The first time I read Quinn’s book, the ending was really a turnaround, which was beyond my expectation. The content of the book is good, but the translation is the only regret of the book. In many places, the translation is very jerky, even the schoolbag is still falling, and the writing is not smooth. If the story is not good, there is no desire to read it. I watched the first half for several days, because there were so many characters on the scene, the names were hard to remember, and the translations made people look like there was no hearty feeling at all. I finished watching the second half in one day, because decryption is the climax part, the plot The design makes people seem wanting... In a word, a good detective novel needs a good translation 
1	The price is right and the configuration is high. The appearance is good and the design is very novel. It has been running for 2 days, and it is normal, and there are no faults that everyone said. Except that the CPU fan is a little louder. However, I think what I bought is very real~! 
1	It is said to be the classic among the classics, and it is also recognized as good. But I don’t know why, I opened it at random, and found that the writing of this book adopts a rigorous scientific system and was written in accordance with Western logic and classification. A page is selected from it, but it has a boring taste. Compared with serious readings with a rigorous system, I regret that I prefer prose readings that “drive everything like an army, it’s better to let everything go back to the field, and laugh all the way”, such as Bacon’s argumentative essays, such as Meng Tian’s essays. Of course, it is the thoughts and feelings from the beginning, maybe after a while the thoughts will be different. 
0	I haven't found any problems after using it. I haven't found any problems after using it. The piano lacquer is too bright, the next pile of handprints. The vista system is not easy to use, it is too slow to open and close. The original one can't pass the test, it's good for people. 
1	Started at 5699. The XP system was installed immediately after the purchase. Driver downloads are available on the official website. Good, good service. 
0	I regret it when I read it. I don't have anything except stringing the words together. It's better to list those words one by one. Want to increase vocabulary? It is really impossible to rely on him, at least it is me. After reading an article, there is no urge to read it. In order not to waste money, it was used as a small vocabulary list, and looked up in the catalog when necessary. There is still no shortcut to learning English, especially remembering words~~&#183;~&#183; 
0	"After comprehensive consideration on the Internet, and called Hanting, Hanting said that the windows on the side of the street were replaced with double-layered windows. The soundproofing is good and there is also a parking lot. Hanting strongly recommends his membership card, but I did not adopt it. Ordered through Ctrip. 1 ""Hanting gave a room close to the hotel's light box advertisement, and the low-frequency noise of the current is not generally small. I didn’t see the double windows. It was indeed very noisy. Early in the morning, a 2 yuan store on the opposite side opened for business. I was depressed and wanted to go down to the other store. Haha 2 ""Parking lot, alas, there are only 8 regular parking spaces. When I went out and came back, there was no land when I stopped again. The Hanting staff asked me to stop at the opposite community and said that I could be reimbursed. I did what they said, took a 5 yuan invoice and went to the front desk for reimbursement. , The front desk said that I would report it together when I checked out. When I checked out the next day, I said that my invoice redemption office was scratched by me, and their financial regulations cannot be reimbursed. Oh my god, how many years have I been in finance? How formal this is I can’t report my invoice, and the front desk staff feels uncomfortable, which makes people very angry. Forget it, then tear up the invoice and leave. Fortunately, I don’t lack the 5 yuan. It's just their promise. . . "
1	Nowadays, people’s lives are under a lot of pressure, and in many cases their own health problems are often ignored, especially for male friends, so it is necessary to learn more about health and health care in daily life. The knowledge of palmprints introduced in this book and the correct judgment of palmprints are still a bit difficult for ordinary people. It is good if it is just a general understanding of their own health. In short, the health of the body still depends on their daily maintenance and protection In addition, being optimistic and keeping a healthy attitude is also the most important to good health. 
1	Dual-core independent display, business machine, good price/performance ratio, it is worth buying, it's pretty good to use it at home 
0	I was very excited about the screening, but after watching it, I found that after the screening, an episode of Mickey Mouse appeared! At first, I wondered whether it was an individual phenomenon of gifting, but later I found that every DVD had it! I really don’t know what the manufacturer thinks, I want to see cats and mice, not Mickey Mouse! If the manufacturer wants to give it away, then the full set of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck will be given away. What about adding one episode to each DVD? ? It is superfluous! ! 
0	We asked for two standard double-bed rooms on the 9th floor, each at RMB 418. When we checked in, we found that the room facilities were extremely poor. The furniture, tables and chairs seemed to be replaced by students in the school, in dilapidated conditions, similar to a guest house in the 90s. I want to stay for only one night anyway. Just bear it. After dinner, we went to another room and found that the decoration of the room was of another level. I felt that the standard of the room was 3 and a half stars, and the anger surged to the reception desk. Negotiations, what is even more annoying is that the reception desk arbitrarily refused our request for a room change or discount, and instead said that it hurt people. We also asked us to check out at almost 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, sweep us out, and let us live on the road! In the 21st century, I can encounter this kind of service attitude, and I don't know which incense is burned wrong. After fighting for nearly an hour, we finally had to file a complaint with the Tourism Bureau. After 10 minutes, the other party asked us to live in a room on the 4th floor decorated with a 4-star standard. The next morning, I found three nails pierced in the tires, and the tires were all flat. Apart from the hotel's revenge, I don't know what enemies I will have in this unfamiliar place? ! Suggestion: The 5th floor and above are additional floors. Most of the rooms are simply decorated. Try to ask for rooms on the floors below. 
1	I like it very much. Qiao Luo, the princess Luoluo stood up strong after the big changes back then, you have to marvel at her. He Chi, he and Qiao Luo have been on the wrong track since they were young, and they couldn't understand each other, but when Qiao Luo was the most miserable, he helped her stand up step by step. He Chi loves Qiao Luo, love is unforgettable and cautious, and Qiao Luo also evades and retreats to let go of everything in the past, opens up to He Chi and accepts his love. The whole book is now intertwined with memories. It feels a little messy, but it doesn't affect my love of this book. 
0	I don’t know why the camera cannot be used. The crystal eye driver is also installed, and there is no response when I click it. Can any hero give me some advice? 
1	Hotel with a good price ratio. This time I upgraded for free, thanks to the front desk staff. The house is okay, the carpet is new, better than last time. Many people for breakfast have to go early. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, very cute, suitable for girls, and the configuration is very high, the initial experience feels very comfortable and fast! The keyboard touchpad is also very good, feel comfortable to touch! 
0	It's not that the left side of the keyboard is hot, but the left side of the whole machine is a little hot, the USB port is a little bit less, the design is not very reasonable, the USB port is on the left, I believe most people use the mouse with the right hand, and the mouse line has to turn to the right 
0	First, the heat dissipation is average. . . After using it for a while, the place where the wrist rest is hot? Second, the cylindrical shaft of the LCD screen and the main unit is too thick. . . Affect the overall appearance. . . The sony book of power button design. . . The third pre-installed system is too bad. . . 
0	"Checking in on September 9th, you can see from small things: the shower curtain is 200mm higher than the bathtub, which makes the toilet water on the floor and loses its function. It is better to say that it is a fig leaf; the restaurant tablecloth is stained with oil, and the waiter always answered with confidence, last night Forgot to change. What is incredible is that the room cannot make international calls! At 23:00 on the 11th, I want to make an international long distance call. The front desk first stated that it was not working well. It is recommended to buy an IC card for the call (you want to make money?). At my insistence, the international long-distance call was opened, but after dialing, a Chinese prompt came out: This number is empty... Obviously there is no ""going abroad"". According to the theory of the front desk, looking for the manager on duty didn't solve the problem, but I found an IP card, tried to dial 17900, but couldn't make the call, and tried to dial 10060 (the hotel called Netcom's phone), but couldn't make the call. Finally, I dialed the international long distance with my mobile phone. I have been on the phone, but I can’t fall asleep for a long time. It’s not my heartache that the phone bill is too high. It's the horror in my heart. In case of fire or theft in the night, can I dial 119 or 110? Lovely authentic three-star hotel! Look up at the calendar, ah! September 11th-horrible 911! ! ! Check out early the next day and leave. Leave Ctrip for long-term cooperation with you. "
1	Wanli did not go to court for more than 30 years. The emperor and the ministers had been fighting for the country for many years. The court fought spit stars and flew around, privately fights to the death and death, the case of the fight against the red pill, the case of moving the palace, the last three of the Ming Dynasty Major cases have been staged one after another, but it is unclear. The integrity of the Donglin Party is noble, and the Eunuch Party shamelessly destroys conscience, justice and evil, conscience and despicability, leaving clear footprints in the long river of history, with different directions. You remember some people because he was a martyr, such as Yang Lian, and some people you will not forget because he is a scum, such as Wei Zhongxian. 
0	I have booked and stayed in this hotel many times. Personal feeling is getting worse now. It was about 3 o'clock in the morning on 6/17. The train arrived in Suzhou. It was about 4 o'clock when I arrived at Jindi Constellation. I thought I could check in as smoothly as before. The receptionists were all asleep on the stage, waking them up, hoping to check in. The answer was: no, there are only 2 hours until 6 o'clock, and the check-in is only possible after 6 o'clock. If you check in before 6 o'clock, you must pay one day's room rate. I asked if I could provide convenience, charge by the hour or let me live first, and complete the relevant procedures after 6 o'clock (this was done before). The receptionist was very rude and said there was no way. Either wait or go. NND and LZ are in a rage, but you can't care about these people. I went out 30 meters from the back door (Furenfang), and stayed in Hanting. The service attitude made people feel really at home. The settlement is based on one day's room rate. What needs to be explained is that the rooms and facilities are exactly the same as those of Jindi Constellation. It’s just that there was no breakfast, and the manager on duty gave me 15 yuan as compensation. The housing price is only half of Jindi Constellation. After all, in a word, next time I will definitely not live in Jindi Zodiac again. Hotel Feedback July 7, 2008: First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for staying in this hotel many times! The hotel leadership attaches great importance to the problem you raised and has carried out rectification. This hotel gives the following explanations on your check-in time question: According to industry regulations, this hotel only counts the room rate for guests who check in after 06:00 every day. Your check-in time for the first two visits to this hotel is 06:06 (August 24, 2006), 05:59 (May 22, 2008). At that time, the receptionist offered a workaround, and you arrived at the hotel at 03:45 in the early morning of June 17, which was 6 off the regulations; There is a long time difference between 00 and the receptionist at that time gave you a full explanation. Nevertheless, we will still accept your comments humbly, and we will work around this situation in the future. Once again, I sincerely welcome you to stay at this hotel next time. 
0	The order placed at 4799, when received, the price became 4699, and an anti-virus CD was presented, and then because of the newly added gifts, I could not apply for price protection. This is obviously a small method for Jingdong to evade price protection, let me Very upset! And nothing was given! ! ! ! 
1	It was okay after a few days, but there is a bright spot! It was really maddening, and a point was not covered by the warranty, and I didn't look at it when I received it!

1	The author of this book has criticized many misconceptions in traditional Western thinking, hoping to construct a new social science research framework, which is the first attempt by Chinese scholars. The author uses a clear concept and strict logic. However, in some places, the controversy is too concise and the actual cases are insufficient, which makes it difficult to understand. The acquisition and use of concepts in this book and the deductive reasoning from basic principles are all physics-based, and can even be regarded as a typical template for theoretical physics research. However, the book emphasizes that social science research cannot be used in many places. Physics as an example is really puzzling! 
0	1. The sound of CD-ROM reading is a bit loud; 2. The overall feeling is not as good as the previous IBM; 3. One less screw is installed in the back 
1	Maybe because it is a posthumous manuscript, I always feel a little messy. However, overall it is pretty good. Lamenting that Jiuli's life was so rough. There are parents who are like no parents. Once they are born, they are adopted to the grandfather and aunt, while the biological parents can only be called the second master and the second aunt. It is better to have a lover than without a lover. The men who have loved deeply, Shao Zhiyong and Yanshan, have all left her. Makes her resentful and nowhere to complain. Thus described the tragic fate of women under the Chinese feudal social system. They often cannot control their own destiny, but this control is firmly held in the hands of men. 
1	It is very close to the railway station and the coach station. The taxi fares start (within five minutes). There is a 24-hour McDonald’s downstairs (orders can be delivered to the room for free). On the left is Pingyuan Shopping Mall, and the opposite is Theaters. 
0	Travel to Hong Kong during the Spring Festival and stay at Regal Oriental Hotel. The price of the hotel is not low, but the conditions are not high. The transportation is inconvenient and the service is average (at the level of domestic express hotels). The hardware facilities in the rooms are not as good as those in express hotels, with very old and very old furniture. The room always smelled of damp and mildew. In the evening, the sound of the air-conditioned computer room in the corridor was constant all night, like a bomber hovering overhead. The waiter saw that the foreign devil was more kissable than his father, and he treated the mainland guests completely differently. The location of the hotel is very poor, it is difficult to get a taxi, the minibus is only 6 yuan for a short distance, and 30 yuan for 5 people is more expensive than a taxi. Do not recommend everyone to stay... 
0	"After reading the chapter of Brothers' grievances in ""The Law of Fairness"", I want to say that ""one slap can't make a sound"". Sun Yingui is defending himself and redressing his grievances, but it makes viewers feel disgusted. Boss Sun has the money to use 15 million yuan to speculate this book, why can't he wait to sell himself Tianjin Bailong Company! "
0	The book has a good point, but the arguments given do not seem to be very good. For example, the appearance of a woman is very important-the argument is how handsome a boyfriend XX has had after plastic surgery, etc. . . Not particularly fond 
1	I just bought one for a friend and it went up by 100 yuan. I needed it urgently. Although the money went up, I had to make an order; but as soon as the goods arrived, they changed to free memory, antivirus, and mouse. . . . Deliberately can't live with me! ! ! 
1	The environment is really good, you can eat, drink and play, you can enjoy it without going out, but the surrounding environment is too bad, except for the hotel, nothing else is worth seeing. It is possible that there are many Japanese people or Japanese shares, the rooms have a lot of Japanese, and there is a Japanese-style room on the first floor (there is no room, it is TATAMI-style). I have eaten western food and Cantonese food there. They are both good and cheap. The service is also very good, the price is very high, it is recommended. 
0	I haven't received the book yet, it's really slow. I bought the book last week, I didn't want to read it this Saturday. 
1	The doorman seems to be good, I don’t remember the others. I slept well at night 
1	The quality is worth the price, and the workmanship is not bad. But it's also because it is worth the price. From packaging to accessories to software, all are simple versions. 
1	"One thing to add is that the binding quality of the old version of ""Hou Hei Xue"" published by Kyushu Publishing House is also very good. The new version looks more atmospheric "
0	There have been many comments on the benefits of this book, but when I showed my son, the three-year-old reacted beyond my expectations. From the beginning, he didn’t want to touch it. When I went to bed at night, he also appointed me to take it away. He said, Mom, I don't like that child. Look at his teeth, he seems to bite!---I really didn't think it would be like this! 
1	Let's talk about the book itself. The paper quality of the book is good, the page thickness is moderate, and the printed writing is clear. As far as the content is concerned, the drugs are quite rich. The introduction is concise. After all, it is a practical version. It is impossible to introduce the clinical pharmacological mechanism of each drug in detail. As for the use, dosage form and specifications, adverse reactions, precautions are okay. The disadvantage is that the name of the medicine is not bold, which is a bit inconvenient to find. What makes me feel most inadequate is that the book I received has blank pages, so the content is not connected. Very dissatisfied with this. 
0	It's really bad. For this price, you can live in a better hotel in Guilin. The attitude of the front desk staff is average. After check-in, the air-conditioning is problematic and the bathroom in the room is not completely separated, which is inconvenient! Anyway, very dissatisfied, it is recommended not to stay 
1	The Chinaga Thousand-Character Essay is the top grade among the Thousand-Character Essays. Even so, many publishers currently print it very poorly for various reasons. As for this collection of ancient essays, the editor and printing level is very high-because I bought several similar editions at the same time, the one from Shanghai Painting and Calligraphy Society is the best. The typesetting of ancient Chinese characters is a very professional work, not very artistic, and definitely not well done. I have seen a lot of collections before. In this one, the calligraphy layout is completely integrated, and it almost feels like Chi Yong's creation. 
1	The battery is strong, although it has not reached 9.5 hours, but it should be 6 hours after the first use. The keyboard is comfortable and the size is right. 
1	What makes me feel that this set of books is worth the money: there is a map of the Song Dynasty behind each book! 
1	The author has a kind of professional caution. If you are lucky enough to learn the original version, it might be better. The simplified version contains more typographical errors, which affects scholars' understanding. The structure of the book is simple, but the content is detailed and easy to learn. This is just a technology. If you can combine this major, you will get a higher learning joy. A wealth of money is not as good as a skill in the body, and a skill in the body is not as good as a thought. Best in the book. 
1	JD’s service is really good. The machine is very good and the system is not difficult to install. I’m very satisfied and like it. I will buy it on JD in the future. 
1	The appearance is fashionable and the price is right. I have already bought a black one for my colleagues. Some netizens have generalized it almost, so I won't repeat it! 
1	Long battery time, beautiful appearance, pearly luster, suitable for girls, full-featured, large keyboard, no sound when running, the system is installed, and the Internet can be accessed by filling in a little data after booting, and it is very convenient to install any drivers. There is also a built-in backup software, if the system crashes in the future, it should be quite useful. 
1	This is a very good traverse text. Cheng Jing from her previous life became the third Miss Qingluo of Fengcheng Xiangfu. She only wanted to live a plain life and be filial to her beautiful mother, but she was the daughter of Xiangfu, and her father was for the sake of phase and prosperity. Qingluo is his bargaining chip for wealth, so she thinks ordinary things are impossible. Fortunately, she met Zili, who was gentle and considerate, but in the end she had to abandon her, the favorite in her heart. Liu Jue, domineering and cynical, from the previous misunderstanding to the later love affair, the twists and turns in the middle make it hard to stop. The author wrote this article really well. 
1	The hotel accommodation environment is good, the front desk service is very warm, the room can see the Yangtze River and Gezhouba, but the shower facilities in the bathroom are not very useful, overall it is a good place! 
0	The attitude of the front desk staff is extremely bad! Will never stay at this hotel again next time. 
0	Without an optical drive, it is inconvenient to install things. It is better to have an external optical drive. 1G of RAM can't bring VISTA at all. Fortunately, I gave a 1G RAM. 
1	Although it is a Korean book, it is somewhat different from our Chinese women in terms of values and aesthetics, but it is also an Oriental woman. Many things can be learned from it, especially in fashion, beauty, etc., South Korea leads the world trend , This is unquestionable. So some of the suggestions and comments on fashion in this book are very valuable, and in the field of gender, as a columnist, the author has shown her experience and wisdom, and some experience is still very useful for young girls. Useful. Overall, this book is good and worth reading. 
0	In fact, this kind of hotel also needs this price, which is puzzling! 
0	The same price difference is one month, the room is doubled! Flicker, then flicker! 
0	"My family took our children to the ""May 1st"", and we selected the hotel that we selected on the Xiecheng website for a long time, but it still seems wrong. 1. The hotel has nothing to do with the layout of large rooms and suites. It was originally not designed for hotels, but the furniture inside is backward and outdated than the hotel-style apartments in Beijing and Shanghai. 2. From entering the reception hall (cannot be called the lobby), there is a smell in the aisles and rooms. You can imagine the smell of smoke, sweat, and musty that can't escape together. The building is completely enclosed and does not have a window for ventilation. It depends on central air conditioning for ventilation. This is the problem. The shop told us that the hot and cold wind is not only natural wind on the night we stayed. It is strongly recommended to ask for clearance before booking. , Can't sleep hot at night. 3. Bath towels and towels are really dirty and old. Samsung is not as good as Samsung. Especially the newly replaced pillowcases have a smell. I thought the waiter did not change and asked for a replacement, but the result is still the same. It seems that there is a problem with the laundry room. 4 The swimming pool is an important reason for us to choose him, because the children are learning to swim. The small pool of 25 meters by 10 meters obviously has no water filtration system, or it is not open. The water is quite mixed. The tourists are all local guests. There is no supplies in the shower room except for the tap. It is recommended that guests do not consider 5. The restaurant did not try, (Xiecheng always corrupts our breakfast. I almost never eat free breakfast in the room booked by Xiecheng) so there is no comment 6. Only It is commendable that the service staff responded quickly, and they can come to explain immediately if there is a complaint. All they can do is explain, and they can't solve the hardware problem. "
0	There are not many practical methods that can allow you to change your concept, but how do you do it after you change your concept? The books recommended in it are all foreign, and many are not suitable for China. 
0	The fever is quite high, the silence is average, the screen is average, and the courier company is very poor, so I put it in the unit's reception room and left. It is an EMS. I have not inspected the goods. If it breaks on the way, who can I call. I gave away anti-virus software as soon as I bought it for one day. After two days, it dropped to 100. I was really dizzy and strongly dissatisfied. Please Jingdong to give me an explanation. 
0	Too flat and straightforward, the words are just words, and most people understand many principles. Similar principles have been written in other books, and there is no incisiveness and uniqueness! Regret buying this book! 
0	Knowledge is interspersed in the story, and it is very interesting, so that while listening to the story, children can learn a lot of knowledge, a very good set of books. 
1	The rooms are small and well equipped. The transportation is convenient, and Times Square is just a short walk away. You can have morning tea in the morning, which is very delicious. Additional comments November 23, 2007: Sorry, the hotel is wrong. It should be correct that the room is very large and very good, but the disadvantage is that the location is relatively biased. 
0	"I bought his ""Soldier"" before. It's not bad. When I saw a new book, I thought it was a sequel. I eagerly bought it. The content is the same as the original one. The writing has been changed. I feel that it is not as good as the original version. The author is not kind. "
0	I still bought it for my baby after reading a lot of reviews, and I didn't think it was good. It's not like a fairy tale at all, and it's not childlike. 
1	The accommodation environment of this hotel is average, the room decoration is average, and the transportation should be very convenient. Hotel feedback January 2, 2008: Thank you for your stay and review! We also have a special standard room newly installed in 2006. The room status is basically a four-star standard. You are welcome to try again! 
1	The waiter's attitude is good, if there is a meal delivery service, it would be perfect! 
1	I bought a home office computer for a friend, and I added 1G memory, and it was very smooth to run VISTA. The workmanship is good, and I feel very good... 
0	The touchpad design is too bad, not as good as Samsung and other brands. The distance between the left and right keys is too large, which is very inconvenient for me who is used to operating the touchpad with one hand. The keyboard keys have large spacing, which is easy to get dust. If you don't even give a system disk, acer is a little bit silly. 
0	I haven't received the goods! ! ! ! ! ! ! No one answered the phone call! ! Never encountered such a thing! ! ! ! I want to consult the post office goods invoice number, but I can’t find it! what happened? It's also the world's largest book shopping network, not to be trusted! ! 
1	"I think this book is generally relaxed, and there is nothing particularly sad about it. But Shi Lian did feel distressed for him when he died. The more worrying place is when Xiang Bao pulled Fan Li on the street and said that he was Xi Shi, Fan Li let go. The more I see this place, the more angry I feel for Xiangbao. There is also what Xiangbao said to Xiangbao when Fucha was poisoned, ""If I die, you will be bullied."" In addition...Finally, Xiangbao said to the language, ""The king is the king of the world; And Fucha, I am the king of one person. The blue water falls, life and death remain unchanged."" "
1	It's been 2 days since I came back and I was very busy. I didn't have time to comment. Today I have to chat about the feelings of staying at the Seaview Hotel. I stayed at the sea view from 7.25 to 7.30, because my family was on vacation and the child was relatively young (5 years old), so when I decided to go to Qingdao for a vacation, I checked the situation of Qingdao hotel on the Internet. It turned out to be the Zhanqiao Prince Hotel. I was surprised to see everyone’s evaluation of the sea view. It can be said that there is no negative evaluation. Everyone agreed that this hotel is excellent, so I canceled the sea view and changed the sea view to see what the sea view depends on to get everyone’s unanimous praise. ! Now I’ll start with the first phone call from the sea view: I booked a flight at 6:00 pm on 7.25, and arrived in Qingdao at about 7:00. When I booked the hotel, I wrote in the remarks that the hotel needs to be picked up. I received it on the 23rd. On the phone of the hotel, a sweet girl contacted me for the specific pick-up time and left me with the phone number of the pick-up staff. I felt very comfortable. After getting off the plane on the 25th, I saw someone holding a person with my name written on it. The sign stood at the exit of the terminal waiting for us. A handsome young man greeted me very politely and took the luggage in my hand very naturally. After getting on the hotel shuttle bus, the driver immediately handed over a cool towel and Mineral water, really thoughtful! Admiring the night view of Qingdao all the way, I drove for about 40 minutes to arrive at the hotel. Before the car stopped, I saw a young man in a suit waiting at the entrance of the lobby. Later I learned that this young man was specially for us. After getting off the bus Immediately there was a bellman who put our luggage on the cart. I prepared to register in the lobby according to the usual practice. As a result, the young man led us directly to the room. All the registration work was done by him. I really felt very comfortable. A very good impression. The room is very comfortable. I booked the executive room 2712. The facilities are very complete. The soothing background music is playing in the room. It can be seen that the hotel is very attentive. Soon the waiter delivered orange juice and towels, and gave them away. A pair of small dolls, the child liked it very much, and later found out that the dolls, fruits and snacks were given out every day, but the baby was very happy. When he went home, the dolls were packed in a pocket. There is nothing to say about the service. The room service is very timely and attentive. When eating in the restaurant, the waiter specially brought the baby special cute cartoon tableware for children. One day the baby had a fever. The hotel soon sent a doctor up to open it. After taking the medicine, for dinner, considering that I was afraid that the baby could not stand the air conditioner, I ordered a meal delivery service. After the dinner was delivered, I found that the hotel had added a large bowl of white fungus porridge, a large plate of french fries and a bowl of ginger soup. The illness was half healed immediately, and the waiter saw us greeting the baby's condition the next day, which made people feel very warm. One day at dinner, I had a slight cough due to smoking too much. Soon the waiter brought me a bowl of white fungus porridge and told me that the cough could be relieved. Also, when I had breakfast on the last day, the baby went to the beach with my mother the evening before. When looking for a small crab, a small bag was bitten on the leg by a mosquito. We didn't care about it, but the waiter took the initiative to send disinfected iodine compresses and wind oil essence to the baby after seeing the baby scratching itching. Ashamed. The five-day holiday is coming to an end soon, I asked the baby, is it OK to go home? The baby said: I don't want to go home, but I want to stay in a hotel. Children speak without restraint, children speak without deception! I was very touched during the five days with the sea view. The employees of the sea view truly reflect the corporate culture of the sea view. If the hardware of the sea view is 5 stars, then the service of the sea view is definitely 7 stars. The sea view is the pride of Qingdao and also the pride of China! 
0	1. The only mountain and water view double-view hotel I have ever stayed in: look up the window to look like Taishan stone, bow down the basin to enjoy the water of the Yellow River. －－The hot water is boiled to the maximum, and the color is like strong tea after 10 minutes. 2. A writing desk that is more vicissitudes of life than Chinese history makes people want to cry. 3. The room smelled bad and the windows were locked. I called the waiter many times to open the window. I waited for 20 minutes to come. The attitude of the waiter was okay, but the efficiency was too low. They explained that they were too busy to be busy. 
1	"Feel a lot of typing too slow. I have asked many Chinese teachers how to learn Chinese? Basically, the teachers' answers are to read more and accumulate more. The truth is right, but I always feel that it is not entirely the point. What is the language? ""The extension of language is equal to the extension of life."" Life is inseparable from language. At the same time, Chinese must be learned in life and learned for life. Language is language knowledge, reading level, writing ability, oral expression ability, thinking judgment ability, humanistic spirit, moral sentiment... Our students, or me, have been for a long time I don't know what the language is. "
1	The location of the hotel is very good, zero distance from West Street. . The hotel is garden-style, and it feels a bit like in the Grand View Garden. . . . The lake view room has a better view, seeing the mountains and seeing the water. . The downside is that the front desk staff seems to be slower and less efficient. . . 
0	Cheap, cheap is not good. Alas, the chip is too bad, it does not dissipate heat, and there is noisy noise in less than a few minutes after booting. Only 3 USB 
1	When my son was six years old, he read this set of books just for me to tell stories. Although I think the picture is really beautiful and admirable, but for him, it doesn't attract his attention. Although it is a set of picture books, I think it might be more suitable for older children! The hardcover version is really a version that our mothers and children don’t like very much, it is easy to break! The page numbers fell off after only about ten times. I hope that booksellers will publish it from the perspective of economic benefits and good storage! 
1	After receiving the book, it took a week to read it again. I feel that this is a very good book to introduce the introduction of search engines, but it is still biased towards theory. After reading this book, I feel that I have a general understanding of the structure of search engines, of course it is relatively preliminary. However, as many netizens have said, the layout of this book may be the most controversial point. Personally, the blank space in this book is too big and too much, and it can be more compact. However, this does not affect it as a good book for understanding search engines! 
0	Because the screen is 16:9, the fonts are very small when playing games or browsing the web, which makes it hard to read! 
1	The price and configuration are the highlights of this machine, especially the AMD780G series notebook performance is quite good, although it is an integrated graphics card, but it can handle various daily tasks! The heat dissipation is not too hot, compared to my old SONY, it can be said that the big hair is the same, and it is not hot at all! 
0	I just switched from Jiuzhou Huanyu to this hotel, and I feel that the gap is too big. It is said to be in the city center, but there is nothing else around except Tianning Temple. The room is a bit old, old style, and the bath water is very small. The price is more than 30% higher than Jiuzhou Huanyu, which is very, very worthless. Will never choose here again unless the price drops below 200. 
0	Like everyone said, I only glanced at the beautiful piano paint, and then it was covered with fingerprints. It’s a pity to cancel the keyboard light 
1	Stayed for 4 nights in March, I feel good, better than Cuiyi, come in May 
1	I don’t see the impression of the hotel on the Internet, but because it is close to the train station and the transportation is very convenient, I chose this place. After I checked in, I felt pretty good. The service staff was polite and friendly, which happened during the stay. One of the things that made me feel the hotel’s humane service. I had a heart attack that day. The hotel staff promptly called the 120 emergency center for me, and accompanied me to the hospital for oxygen infusion for two consecutive days and provided me with I received delicious meals and gave me meticulous care. When my condition improved and I was about to return, the bellman helped me buy a train ticket to go back. The bellman also sent me on the train, and I received the same after I got home. The greeting phone number of the assistant manager in the hotel lobby, asked me about my condition and told me to pay more attention to my body. I was really touched. Huayi made me, a foreigner in a different place, feel the warmth of home. Choose to stay in this hotel. 
1	It's not bad to use, I still have a few 2000-100 1000-50 East coupons plus qq 673946022 
1	1. Under the premise of national foundry, I hope that the manufacturer ASUS will know where to control and optimize better than other companies; 2. The system installation is not as troublesome as thought, except for the driver. . . Legend can also use ghost directly, try it next time; 3. Good price/performance ratio. 
0	The room facilities are too old, lack of wardrobes, bathroom tiles and towels are yellow, as if they were eliminated by other hotels. Generally speaking, I am a little sorry for the price of 209 yuan. 
0	The mirror surface is easy to leave fingerprints, and there are always problems when powering on after hibernation. It may be a backup problem. 
1	The bed in their house is too hard. Sleeping with a backache is considered to be a backache! The room is a bit old, and the soundproofing is not very good. There happened to be a few people staying in a separate room in the middle of the night. The sound is noisy anyway (but this is the same as the occupant's Quality is more relevant)! There is no electric kettle in the room, only one pot 
1	Seeing the new Carmela, I immediately felt a different feeling, joy and excitement. I didn't expect that there would be eight or nine after the seventh. It was like a new one, and the order was quickly placed. When I saw the online review, I said that I had to bring seven to buy. There was some hesitation, but Dangdang had already considered this issue for us. Therefore, my two books are separate orders. Parents who want to buy them for their children, please act quickly. The humor and cuteness in the book are not just words. I think what attracts me more is the pictures. They are too cute to describe and can only be shared after reading them. 
0	Not as good as expected. After reading it, I feel even more distrustful of the so-called domestic psychologists. Do not go to the consultation easily. 
1	The book is much better than I thought. The layout of the book is very delicate, with laces that I like, especially the light blue title page, plus the outline of the little angel, which is the kind of old book before Europe. The printing is also very good, the font is not small, the original book I bought is smaller than this, the book is really thicker, it is better to be published in two volumes, in short, I am satisfied. 
1	Original authentic products are cheap, orders are placed quickly, and delivery is timely. Qingdao door-to-door pickup is more reassuring 
0	Take a meter from Beijing airport to the hotel for 205 yuan. For a 4-star hotel listed, Ctrip says it is 3-star-very correct! To be honest, 2 stars are almost the same. 1) Not all rooms have broadband. Please try it first if you do. I changed 3 rooms at night for this. 2) There is no free bottled water supply in the standard room. 3) Please pay attention to those who want to call:: Regardless of whether the other party answers or not, charges will start after 20 seconds! ! Very peculiar regulations! So, be careful. 4) 800 free Ctrip calls are charged in this hotel, be careful! 5) 10800AT&T collect calls are charged, not service fees, but charged based on local calls. Repeated explanations are still useless! ! ! It's not just whether his home phone is from China Telecom, China Telecom 10000# says it is free, but it still can't explain it! 6) The room is very old, slippers are thinner than paper, the air conditioner is not hot, and there is no heating facility, which made me add a quilt in the middle of the night-unimaginable, this is a listed 4-star hotel in the great capital Beijing. 
0	Sometimes the CD-ROM cannot be recognized and only one C drive is allocated; who only uses a 250G drive? Don’t know that the starting point of the installation is to facilitate customers? Or formally complete the installation task? 
0	It’s a pity that without the system, the workmanship and design would be better than sony, but do you get what you pay for? 
0	The battery standby time is short, about one and a half hours, and it still generates a lot of heat compared to the Intel system. Acer's customer service ability is weak. I don't know if it is individual or common. 
0	The battery capacity is still a bit small for a gaming notebook. Although the workmanship of the abrasive tool is smooth, it is soft. The biggest weakness is the sis chipset. Although it is not that bad, it is always so uncomfortable in my heart. Why do we have believed in Microsoft advertising for so many years! 
0	The optical drive is relatively rough, all interfaces are on the left side, and the notebook's surface is not attached with a protective film. It is easier to hang on the surface during transportation, and the power interface is relatively loose and the power cord is easy to touch. There is no touchpad switch key, no hard drive indicator. 
1	This is a very good book on Chinese medicine. If I don’t understand Chinese medicine, I have learned about Chinese medicine from this book. I can use the theories of Chinese medicine to health care according to my own situation, instead of listening to what others say I do. This is a kind of blind obedience. After studying this book, I feel that my healthy actions have a basis. This is the most important thing. I hope that the author and publisher will publish such a good and easy-to-understand book written by experts. It also allows me to see experts and general The difference between doctors also allowed me to see the skill of our doctors of Chinese medicine and the charm of Chinese medicine. Thank you 
1	The appearance is satisfactory, the configuration is OK! The wireless network card driver comes with it and can be installed, who said it cannot be installed! 
1	Good value for money, I live in a business room in Donghui Building, breakfast is also good, the doorman is not very active, the deposit is the highest in the hotel I have stayed, the lobby manager is very good, now I don’t bring enough, and the password of the card is wrong , Resulting in insufficient deposit, the supervisor helped me sign a letter, comfortable 
0	The power adapter is very hot. It’s really hot. And there are many things in the computer that are not installed. You have to do it yourself. There is no mouse, no protective film, no anti-virus software, no mouse pad, basically nothing. 
0	No system, so troublesome to install XP! (Friends who want to install XP, please refer to: http://tommyjade.blog.163.com/blog/static/91910950200952821959864/) 
1	Sony’s laptop looks beautiful, but I think it’s very important to buy a laptop, so I chose it 
0	I don't know why this book is so popular. Said several things: happiness is contagious. Be more secular. Be a selfish person who doesn't hate. Have noble taste. Don't indulge in misfortune. To continuously enrich yourself. Learn to manage money. 
0	The only problem is that I can’t do ghost mirroring. I’m rather depressed. I don’t bother to use WinPE to do it. It’s better to reinstall and save trouble. 
1	After reading this book, I am still quite depressed. Yes, I have forgotten the needs of my soul for a long time. I am tired from the so-called life every day. I feel so busy and dizzy, but I feel that the experience of the empty readers is very rich. According to his own psychotherapy practice, he analyzes people’s spiritual growth from a deep level. For me, a non-psychology major, it may be a little bit obscure, especially about the analysis of dreams. I look at me in the cloud...I will increase my abilities and read it slowly later. 
1	The room is too small, and the room I booked with the GreenTree Inn membership card is better than the room booked by Ctrip. It is the last room on the fifth floor, it seems to be 522, the room is very big, and the bed is also oversized. It’s much larger than the 1.8 meter. I hope Ctrip can provide such a room 
0	1. The tin foil paper is poorly made. 2. A thread from the back plate flew out and posted it back for me 4. The film on the DVD is gone. The machine has fingerprints (not mine) 
1	"I always tell my students that those who know you must be your neighbors. This sentence is absolutely correct when applied to the Japanese. Japan and us have similar cultural origins, and since modern times we have always regarded each other as friends and opponents of each other. From the perspective of friends and opponents, of course we will see us more thoroughly. So, I recommend this rare book to my friends. The only shortcoming is that the translator made some ""necessary"" cuts. I don't understand, why delete it? Does academic research have to be castrated? "
1	I've stayed in this hotel many times. Last time I came to the front desk, the waiter could accurately report my name, and I felt very kind. Four-star is not the same. And the waiter also arranged for me a business single room that day, the room is very new, better than the price I ordered. It is said that the hotel is engaged in activities, business guests like us have the opportunity to enjoy it, not bad. 
1	"I stayed in a big bed room, the room is very big, and there is a very comfortable sofa. But the hotel facilities are relatively old, the paint on the wood is peeled off, and the service is better. Agree with the previous friend’s evaluation, ""As for the Buddha, hehe, maybe you can use an astronomical telescope!"" "
1	In the past, I often participated in many prize-winning competitions, and I often encountered Sudoku questions. In the previous section, I saw a new Hong Kong film in which the bishop was answering Sudoku questions when he was on the bus. It felt like a realm. I had nothing to do in my spare time, and I had a sudden inspiration to book four Sudoku books, one on the bedside at home, one in the car, and one in the office. The rest of the book is already in charge-mine. Son now. Develop intelligence, exercise logic and reasoning skills! Take a book with you and have fun on the road, at home, after work, and at any leisure time! 
0	If it weren't for the fact that he was a 4 star, he would not stay in, but only after he checked in did he know that he was fooled. The room is very old. Only the superior room can provide Internet access. The breakfast variety is small and the service of the waiter is very poor. 
0	The 14-inch wide screen does feel a bit smaller, and the viewing area is too small. There are 1 or 2 small bumps on the lacquer. The fan sound is quite bearable. Vista is not very accustomed to use, and you can't log in with live messenger, you have to manually run commands to change the configuration. 
0	The price of the book changed before it was received, and I found that the price at the place where the book was selected is different from the price on the order. Sometimes the price is high when selected, and sometimes it is low. This time I was a little disappointed in the book purchase. I haven't read the book yet, so I haven't commented on it. 
0	I thought it was a good book in the online reviews, and I felt that I must read it, otherwise I am afraid that I will regret it when I am in my 20s. But I didn't feel much content when I read it. I felt a little fooled. I didn't like it. The content was very superficial. The writing was very realistic, but a little boring. 
1	I bought the 4299 some time ago. There was no suit. Later, the suit was only 4199. I applied for price protection. The customer service was very patient and liked it. Although this machine is more troublesome in transferring the system and sound card, some people have provided a solution to this problem on the Internet. 
1	The workmanship is good, the main thing is that the price is really 2400XT. I looked at the online notebook graphics card rankings, and it was relatively high, compared with the 9300, so I chose it. I saw the 3-star model before I bought it. The 3400 model with a 9200GS unique display cost 3999 and only has an extra camera. I didn’t see it clearly before I bought it, so this model also has a camera, sweat! ! I went back to open the CS, and I turned on 32 computers without a card, the graphics card was not bad, and the touch of the sound above was very sensitive, and it was reflected by touching it. Very cool! The appearance is blue, but I actually prefer black, but not. regret! 
0	Inform all my friends that this hotel is simply a black shop 1. For dinner in the lobby on the first floor, 5 yuan a cup of white water. 2. The things in the canteen are 5-8 times the market. 3. There was a porn call at 12 o'clock in the evening. The next day I asked the waiter, they said it was the hairdressing on the first floor, and it had nothing to do with them. I advise you not to move in. 
1	I bought the lacquered notebook for the first time, and it looks better than I thought. My friends also said that thinkpad is also the first to buy. It is the same as I thought, and the quality is good. There is little heat and no noise, I think it’s worth it 
1	"I used to think that the principles taught as a teacher are enough to face life. The first time I saw ""Xiaoqiang's Promotion"" from a friend, I fell in love with it. Every step that Xiaoqiang takes is a must in life. Not just limited to the workplace. Even if I read it the first time with the mentality of reading a novel, I can't help but sigh: How good I can do it! When I got my own ""Xiaoqiang's Promotion"", I realized that it is not just a novel. According to Xiaoqiang's method of getting life and work, I decided to change my habits from now on. I hope I can become like an old payer. Mentor, cultivate more ""big trees""... "
0	Poor difference, big room and poor furniture, breakfast but poor quality, broadband but poor internet speed, almost equal to zero. The environment is good and the traffic is too bad. 
0	Dangdang’s customer service was rubbish and had a very bad attitude. I used a gift card to pay for an order, then canceled the order, regenerated an order and wanted to pay with a gift card, and found that the gift balance was already zero. Then I called the customer, and it took me 3 to 5 working days to reply the amount of the gift card. I said why it took so long. She said that 3 to 5 days passed quickly, and she didn't know if she was living on Mars. Then I asked, what should I do if the goods of my current order are out of stock after waiting 3 to 5 days? The answer is: you can buy another time! Is this what people say? Obviously my own system is so rubbish, but the customer is required to bear the loss. 
0	I stayed there once before and found a mouse. Later I saw others saying that they had refurbished, so I chose this hotel this time. But it really disappointed me. Everything was the same, nothing changed. After only staying for one night, I fell ill. Will never stay in this hotel again next time. 
1	When I first entered Sofitel Ginza Hotel, I was warmly received by the lady at the front desk. She told me that all rooms booked through Ctrip can be upgraded for free, and I feel very warm. My room was arranged on a dedicated lady's floor. I have stayed in so many hotels. For the first time I heard that there is a dedicated lady's floor. There are many good-looking women’s magazines in the room, as well as cotton pads and bath salts. The most important thing is that the room is very high, the air is good, and the view is better. You can see all the buildings in Jinan, as well as Daming Lake and Quancheng Square. Glance. Next time you come to Jinan, you must still live here... 
1	I brought my friends back to Qingdao to play in April. The hotel was chosen for them. The room was clean and tidy, but the bathroom facilities were too simple. There was a small refrigerator in the room. The consideration was more thoughtful. It would be better if the bathroom facilities were better ! The attitude of the service staff was very good, and did not shame us Qingdao people, and the phone was on call. 
0	The driver of the xp system is more troublesome to install, and the sound of the CD-ROM drive is louder when reading the disk, but the general CD-ROM drive is less used and acceptable 
1	Tinkpad’s books are still good. Although they have been streamlined a lot for cost reasons, they are still ok in terms of appearance and speed. The price is high. 
0	This model is really hard to grab, and the price/performance ratio is quite high. It is perfect to directly use the Vista system after buying it, and there is no driver problem. 
0	The facilities are aging and the road close to the road is too noisy. At night, the sound of the water flowing in the bathroom upstairs and the noise of the air-conditioning were very loud, and I couldn't sleep. After reporting to the reception, the waiter arrived late and emphasized that it was so. It is recommended to stay at Anqing Hotel in the development zone and Jinjiang Inn on Renmin Road in the urban area 
0	I am very interested in books on Chinese medicine. Seeing that this book is so popular and many readers have commented on it very well, I bought it with great enthusiasm. As a result, I was very disappointed and disappointed. The viewpoints in the book lack scientific basis, so I won't say it, and I can't even justify it. The metaphor is novel but unreasonable. After each article or paragraph puts forward a point of view, many of the things that follow have nothing to do with the point of view. It is completely messy and wrong. There are so many people who like this book, but there is no choice but to sigh. 
0	"I gave this hotel a bad review. The encounters are as follows: 1. When I checked in, I was told that there was no booked ""Garden View Room"". The reason was far-fetched, saying that Ctrip's order was unclear. I was helpless and ready to accept. 2. When I entered the room, I found a room on the first floor. , Very small and no windows; the colleague’s room is in another building and there is no broadband. It is proposed to change, the tone of the front desk is soft, and the attitude is tough: you can only add money according to the'hotel price'. I want to'discuss' with the foreman leader, it is impossible; His male colleague was anxious, his voice increased by two intervals, and the front desk called before, and he distorted the facts face to face, saying,'There are two customers, they have to change the room type and don't add money.'...we were suddenly speechless. ! The dispute that lasted for nearly 40 minutes finally attracted a'manager'. After listening to us explain the cause and effect, we exchanged the'hotel's own garden landscape standard room' at the original price (I don't understand if the hotel booked through Ctrip was not the hotel itself The room?...) 3. Enter the new room and find that this is the so-called ""Garden Landscape Standard Room"", which is not bad. But...at night, I found that the broadband cannot be used. It is said that the system has just been installed and needs to be debugged. Another telephone Internet line (ISDN?) conflicted with our company's network settings. The network administrator was very good. After more than an hour of debugging, I brought it to the computer for testing. It was almost 12 o'clock in the night before it finally succeeded... 4. Wake up in the morning, the expensive and unrealistic breakfast adds another layer to our dissatisfaction with the hotel. It is the most depressing business trip since the beginning of the hotel. Feedback from the hotel July 7, 2008: Dear guest, Hello, In response to your feedback, the hotel will reply as follows: 1. We will reconfirm the room type and quantity provided in cooperation with Ctrip, as well as the detailed description of the reservation form, to avoid similar incidents from happening again! 2. We will reconfirm all reservation requirements and The price, the garden view room is the same standard, no matter which way the guests who stay in the hotel enjoy the same treatment, we apologize for what happened to you and your friends! For the reception language and service attitude of the front desk staff, we We will intensify training and assessment, and sincerely hope that through our work, every guest who comes to the store can feel cordial and thoughtful! 3. We do have a period of time to update all the network systems in the store, and we will bring you during this time We apologize for the inconvenience! 4. The catering department of the hotel has made significant adjustments to the breakfast varieties. The current varieties are very rich and nutritionally balanced. We sincerely invite you to have the opportunity to visit this hotel again, and we will make you unhappy last time To make up for your experience, thank you again for staying at this hotel and look forward to your visit again! "
1	A very cost-effective one~ and I am also the one I am most satisfied with. Convenient at the door, a fruit shop, 5 minutes walk from Jiuguang Department Store, 5 minutes walk from Jing'an Temple on Line 2. The hotel service is in place! Praise~ The room is good Convenience, sufficient taste, sufficient quantity, and affordable prices~ I will always choose here in the future. Ha ha, please remember to book early! 
0	Maybe there is a difference in cultural understanding between China and foreign countries. Maybe there is a generation gap with children. I don’t think so. I still prefer comic books with a little ink and wash style. I hope my daughter will like it when she grows up (22 months) 
0	The 6-cell battery is a bit prominent, the pre-installed Norton and Office are both trial versions, and the inner bag looks a bit rough when given 
1	I took the order in the morning and picked it up in the afternoon. The machine is very cost-effective. It took 10 days before I came up for evaluation. I found that the machine has not been reduced by Jingdong. I am very happy. There is only one speaker, and the sound effect is OK. So bad, it runs smoothly after reinstalling the system, there is no problem! 
0	The price can go down a bit (the price of Hong Kong Bank is dual battery + inner package + xp), the 3-cell battery is a bit small, and the 1g memory is a bit small. The most important thing is that the resolution is 1024*576, which is a bit annoying 
0	The quality of the paper is not good, and the text is slanted. The piracy is very irresponsible. Although Hu Lan is not considered human, the text is still beautiful, but with such a rough paper quality, it is really very handy. Affect reading, 
0	There is a bright line on the right side of the screen, shaped like a long knife. I have bought many things on JD.com, and the first time I ran into trouble, it should be a quality problem. 
0	The heat is relatively large, it may be that the system is not installed properly, the CPU temperature has been above 50 degrees, and the voltage sometimes becomes 1.3V, I don’t know why 
0	I despise the packaging of Jingdong. More than 2,000 things are covered with foam. When things go wrong, they are pushed to the manufacturer. The manufacturer is more talented in measuring the temperature and saying that it can be used if the temperature is not higher than 90°. Why didn't she be a doctor? 
1	To Dunhuang, staying at this hotel is convenient for eating, lodging and transportation, suitable for travel friends. 
0	The noise of the hotel is too serious, almost no soundproofing facilities do not meet the environmental protection requirements. And the person in charge of the hotel has a bad attitude and does not consider the interests of the guests. One side of the house does not meet the star standard. 
1	Although I stayed in a deluxe room, the facilities of the room still looked a bit dated. Early breakfast is not very rich, but I think that for the 50 yuan breakfast in a four-star hotel, I may be too demanding. But the door face of this hotel is back enough. Hidden in a small alley. Fortunately, taxi drivers know it. 
1	I am a middle school Chinese teacher. The child is six years old. Regarding education, it is consistent with the author's point of view. This is a book that every mother and every teacher is worth or should have. (Educators who have power should have it. But they won't do that.) This is the book I have read the most and the most detailed of its kind. Both from the mother's perspective and the teacher's perspective have benefited me a lot. In addition to what the author said, from my son's perspective (for boys), I also emphasized sports. 
1	Small! The workmanship is really pp, the keyboard is also good, and the feeling of typing is also very good, I like it, tomorrow I will find my classmates to reinstall the system, strive for dual systems, hehe :) 
0	I didn't believe it when I saw the comments of netizens. After I went there, I knew what is the dirtiest and worst hotel in the world. 
1	A very rare book, because almost everyone in Master Tonghua's works is a good person! Good people's lives, good people's love, but good people can't avoid hurting each other, and good people may not be able to get happiness, so there are tears of good people. Look at that Yujin's heart, Jiuye's embarrassment, Huo Qubing's obsessive perseverance, people can't help but expect a perfect ending. However, no one can divide the heart in half, and this ending may not be the best choice. 
1	1: Good appearance, very suitable for MM. 2: Cost-effective, with all the necessary functions 3: Perfect screen, fast response 
0	The promised delivery on the second day cannot be achieved at all. I have been waiting for 2 days, and I asked the customer service to talk perfunctorily before contacting me. No one has contacted me yet 
1	Overall, it is not bad. The old hotel is one of the best in the area. Very clean. The restaurant is also good. The disadvantage is that it is too far away from Wuzhishan Scenic Area (about 40KM, more than an hour's drive). If you really want to play in Wuzhishan, you still need to choose to live near the scenic spot. 
0	The operation of LINUX system is still not used to it. In addition, it is not possible to exchange WINDOWS files with LINUX files, so there will be some inconveniences 
1	I just got it yesterday. The performance is generally good. Almost all the software is available. You can go online when you get it. You have to buy the Office. 
0	1 The temperature of the C surface is slightly higher, but it is within the acceptable range; the adapter will be very hot during charging, but there is a reminder in the manual. 2 There is no instruction on the switch of the capital letter key. Please pay attention when entering the password 
0	I found several system disks but couldn’t find the SATA hard disk. Finally I made a boot disk with U disk, first started a Win PE operating system, and then used Ghost to install a XP　sp3 image in the Win PE environment. The XP system is installed. 
0	I thought it was a funny comic, but I bought three copies after seeing the popularity on the Internet! Unexpectedly, it's just like the author's life diary, writing some things in life, and the language is also very common (maybe it is due to translation). In short, I think it is a bit boring, hehe~It should be suitable for young girls~hehe ~ (PS: I am 18, male) 
0	The items have not been found to be insufficient, but the service of JD.com is really not good, and the efficiency of customer service needs to be improved. 
0	I bought the full set and I have never seen such a rubbish. In fact, only one copy is enough, and the rest is permutation and combination. Such a book can also be a best-selling book in the United States? This is why you can’t see it in bookstores. In less than two minutes, you can understand what piece together and repetition are. After seeing the real thing, I am afraid that no one wants to buy it. This is just a set of books that the booksellers have collected irresponsibly, but if I don’t pay attention, I will be fooled. I'm stupid! 
0	The staff is of poor quality. Although after booking the hotel through Ctrip. I wanted to extend my stay after the expiration date. Ctrip notified that there was no room, so I wanted to check through the front desk to see if there could be a room. As a result, two employees at the front desk spoke very impolitely, saying that I could not live, and they asked me to check out if they didn’t have a room. Later, after the sales solved the problem, I was still satisfied. But as soon as I called the hotel today, I found out Was cheated by that sale. He promised to book a room for me and confirmed the price with me. In fact, I didn't book it at all. He also told me that if I book again next time, he will arrange it for me again, and there will be no next time. If you don't talk about the credit of the hotel. Can't live at all. 
0	It looks like a warehouse change, good slippers, ok bathroom, poor breakfast 
1	Added (at the end of the second paragraph): Qianyin sings in a low voice that charming sentiment like scorching sake, which also makes the lips and teeth fragrant, rich and sweet... 
1	The biggest advantage is cheap, this configuration 4799 is really cheap. It looks good and beautiful. The noise and heat dissipation problems are average, not bad. 
1	As a gift for daughter 6.1. Although it was a few days late. When I got it, my daughter couldn't put it down, she went to the bathroom and looked at it, telling her it was not good. He actually refuted me by studying Chairman Mao. I objected a few words and said that I was disrespectful to the chairman. gosh. Last weekend, I told me that she took the hot shoes and wind shoes to school. Many students envied her. Haha, I also watched the crow among them, but unfortunately I fell asleep at the urging of my husband before I finished it. Having said so much, it can be summed up in one sentence: the value of this set of books. 
1	Many of the places in the book are not what I imagined. At first, I thought they were the more famous scenic spots in the country, but I have never heard of many places in the book. They are relatively unfamiliar towns. It’s not too beautiful from the picture, maybe you have to be in it to feel it. The book records a scene in my hometown. I have been there once, but I don’t feel anything special here, it’s just normal Farmhouse. I haven't been to other places yet, even if I have a yearning for myself, I still have the opportunity and conditions to go and take a walk. 
1	I bought a white one with this account. I think the black one looks better. Although it is a hundred yuan more expensive, I finally bought the gray one! This gray and closer to black! ! The design is very beautiful, it makes people love it! ! ! The configuration is good, so many computers are bought by Lenovo. Although it is a bit expensive, it is still very cost-effective! ! 
0	The order day on January 6th, January 27th has not yet arrived at the local post office, Dangdang customer service (a male) has not checked, Dangdang's service is too bad! Disappointed, it seems I have to look for something else! 
0	There are bubbles in the protective film of the machine housing at the time of receipt. The warranty card has no official seal. I wonder if everyone else is like this. Cross the line of fire and run up the card. 
0	Generally speaking, everyone’s feedback is good, but I feel that it is average. Although the narrative is in plain and easy-to-understand language, there is no lack of humor, but I just can’t enter it. I’m sleepy when I lie in bed many times and look at it. ~ 
0	My goodness, my son really likes to turn around, and he almost turned to pieces in less than a month. Now it can be said that you are memorizing the book backwards. If you reverse the page, he will know what is on the previous page and what is on the back. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful! The configuration is also very balanced! I mentioned it myself, I think the price/performance ratio is very high! Installing the system is not so troublesome! Change the hard disk to IDE mode, and then select the CD-ROM drive to boot first. Then you can automatically install the system partition! 
1	For notebook novices, it is easier to use and looks good. If you have a problem and don’t understand it, it will be solved quickly by calling the after-sales service. It is cost-effective. 
0	The price/performance ratio is very high, 2999.00 yuan, which can be configured with a relatively high laptop. Very cost-effective. Basic configurations are available. 
0	There are two shortcomings: 1. The power box is extremely hot! It's very hot soon after the power is connected! 2. There is only one memory slot, and the original one must be removed to add memory. 
0	The performance is average and meaty, but the Internet speed is very fast, faster than my HP, and depressed. . . The battery is too strong~ When can a big book be used for 6 hours? 
1	I just bought it for less than a month, and I found it very tiring to use it two days ago. My eyes accidentally found that the screen jumped very badly (it was very shaking). I thought my eyes were too tired. I hurt my eyes. In fact, when I first came out last year, I bought one and it worked well. So this year, my boyfriend gave me another one as a birthday gift, but it was so bad~~ I need an explanation. . . 
0	I am somewhat resistant to this book. The pictures are all terrible, and it feels better not to show them to children. . . . . . 
0	The material and workmanship feel rough. The fever is relatively large. When using it, the sound card suddenly disappeared. If it happens again. That is a problem with the integrated sound card. The CPU is slower. 
1	5USB interface, plus esata interface, the interface is very complete, and the performance configuration is not low 
0	The bathroom is very small. The internal facilities are not humane, especially the hot water facilities are obviously in poor contact, and the patch panel behind him is underneath, which is not convenient to use. 
0	The first time I stayed at Rujia, the actual situation is too far from reality. The smell in the room is very big, and it is very noisy to open the windows for ventilation. The hygiene is not flattering! Move out soon after check-in time. And the location is very biased, I don’t know why I chose the location here! In short, will not live again! The meat-shabu downstairs is average! 
0	"Agree that ""the book has no substance"" contains a summary of the translations that have problems with food/sign words, etc. The translation errors in most of the simple words are wrong, so there are other meanings, but in fact the probability of this kind of error appears It is very small or very boring. For example, on page 130, when asked about the age of a student, the student said ""I'm fourteen"" as ""I'm forty"". Page 1 says that pear is written as rear. Is this kind of thing also used by the author to make sense? There are many jokes in Chinese and English translations. I believe anyone can find some if they are willing to collect them. Picking up something casually will not only hurt the reader's appetite, but also hurt your own reputation. I am not opposed to entertaining books, but boring entertaining books really turn my appetite. Rubbish! "
1	"Three of us can live in a room here, and the waiter also offered us an extra bathroom set. The quality of disposable bathroom products is good. The room is a bit smaller, but there are many humanized designs in the decoration, which my mother likes it very much. There is also a board in front of the service desk, which states the buses to take from this store to various attractions, which is convenient for tourists to travel. However, the location of this store is a bit biased. I decided this one because it is very close to the ""Lingering Garden"". "
1	The overall feeling of staying at the hotel on July 19 was better. The disadvantages are as follows: 1. The signs from Building 1 to Building 2 are not obvious, and they have to go a long way. 2. The service staff seem to have no idea what it means to meet and say hello. It's far worse than the Seaview Garden Hotel. I was in the hotel lobby, corridors, and yards and saw the service staff in various positions in the hotel. Most of them didn’t know that they should take the initiative to greet the guests. 
1	On July 1st and 2nd, I checked into the hotel’s deluxe sea-view room. I booked it after reading Ctrip’s reviews. Facing the sea, it was really good. In particular, the hotel has a lot of supporting recreational facilities, a very clean swimming pool, a 20% discount for in-house guests for bowling and golf driving range, and the attitude of the hotel staff is also very good. My son is particularly fond of this hotel, saying that he will stay in Weihai in the future. The breakfast buffet is less variety. 
0	The book was bought for my baby girl who is two years and three months old, and she has no interest in this book. The nine-year-old son also flipped it casually. He usually likes to read different books. 
0	I have stayed in so many Home Inns, this one is the worst, the service is very poor, the location is also very poor, the hardware facilities are like a county guest house. The taxi driver couldn’t find the place, so he called to the main station to ask, but no one answered him. Finally, he went around a few times and found it in a small alley. When he went to the main station and asked why they didn’t answer the phone, he actually replied. Too busy. I booked a business big bed room. When I arrived at the room, I found that there were parking lots outside the windows everywhere. It was too noisy to sleep, and there was no room to change. I was depressed. . . Will never live again. Additional comments December 21, 2007: I received a call from the assistant of the general manager of this hotel today. I apologized for some of the previous things and explained some reasons. I feel that the attitude is still very good. I hope that there will be improvements in the future and better service to all customers, especially those of Ctrip. :) 
0	We stayed at the hotel for 450 yuan/day in early November. It feels okay. That is, the guest room puts disposable pajamas and free pajamas together, with the same outer packaging. One-time pajamas charge 98 yuan, and they are deemed to be used as long as they are opened. The problem is that the two kinds of pajamas are put together and are not clearly marked. Moreover, the hotel has no windows and the indoor lighting is not good. If you don’t pick up the two pajamas and distinguish them carefully, you can just pick one at random and tear the disposable pajamas away. As a service industry, should hotels provide clear charging instructions to prevent customers from making mistakes? 
0	"Some words are remote and impractical. They are not focused, and the introduction says that after reading the book, they will laugh and laugh. It is a bit of a boast. In fact, I feel hard ""humor"" or even talking to myself, I laugh at all when I am happy If I don’t get up, I feel that the author is somewhat naive and vulgar. Perhaps this is one of the characteristics of Korea. "
1	The villa is very quiet, the air is very good, the traffic is convenient, the room air conditioner is not too cold 
1	Convenient transportation, satisfactory service, and good surroundings 
0	It mainly introduces the meridian acupoints. I feel that it is a little bit of the east and a little bit, the content is very scattered, and the method inside is very vague, and it will be ranked as a bestseller, and it feels like a fool 
0	"It's a beautifully packaged book, but the content is a bit disappointing. I bought this book for ""Zhuangzi"". I originally read the original chopsticks, but I didn't quite understand in some places, and I couldn't really understand the truth. , I thought that Yu Dan’s experience would be inspiring, but I found that her experience was more shallow than what I had realized. I was disappointed~~ Although I can’t tell any profound truth, this book It’s not helpful at all for me to have a deeper understanding of ""Zhuangzi""~~ "
0	It’s troublesome to install the system. If I don’t want to use Vista or Win7, I tossed it for a long time and got it done with the deeply customized XP installation disk. It does not come with a driver disk at random, and it is not good. You can only download it online 
0	I bought this book after listening to the introduction of the TV station. I feel that this book is written for foreign babies. For my own children, this book does not feel suitable. 
0	The book is too small for children to read. Some pages have too many words and very small fonts. It may be suitable for elementary school students! I don't like it very much. 
0	The environment is dirty and unclean. The bed sheets seem to have not been changed for a long time and are worn out. Hotel Feedback June 29, 2008: Thank you for your valuable comments. Our facilities and equipment have been completely replaced. Welcome to your next stay! 
1	"However, so what? The value of a text lies in the connection between its life and the life of the reader. &#160;&#160; No need to be concealed, I resonate with it for a long time, &#160;&#160; I feel depression, feeling sad, twisted violence and empty fart, &#160;&#160; also deeply She fell in love with Huixian, buried deep, powerless, seeing the light, ""If it weren't for the bright red light, I almost thought that even this love had become an empty fart."" "
1	Lightweight, I thought that the x series should be lighter, but I didn't expect it to be so light. It's not a little lighter than the ASUS A8Js I used before. 
1	It's okay to buy this machine at this price, the machine runs fast, the express delivery speed is also fast, and the installation system is not too troublesome. First install a clean version of the ghost system, I have downloaded all the drivers before the computer is home, so it goes well 
1	The oral history of scientists is not only about the history of natural science in their respective fields, but is actually a history of social development and humanities. For example, the protagonist of this book joined a progressive organization when he was studying at Southwest United University, and he was beaten as a rightist in 57. It is also like the dean of the Faculty of Science Wu Youxun. This period of experience is not purely natural science, absolutely inseparable from the society at that time. But it can be seen from the sincere patriotism of the scientists at that time, and they can also have a better understanding of all aspects of society and humanities at that time. 
0	There are countless books in Dangdang, but this one is the most rubbish, with hundreds of pages in all, but only three or two pages are useful, and anger cannot be expressed in words. 
1	Personally, I don’t respect netbooks, and I think it’s a bit tasteless. I bought them for my friends. . After the trial, I feel it is suitable for people with small hands. At least I still feel uncomfortable when typing on the keyboard, and it is easy to make mistakes. . The battery life is much longer than other netbooks, about 6.5 to 7 hours. Although it has not reached the claimed 9 hours, it is already pretty good. 
1	I have been following this laptop for some time. I originally wanted to buy it at 3388, but I missed it now at 3399. Plus, it's a bargain price with a coupon. Not bad use 
0	As soon as I opened the book, I couldn’t let it go. I read it in one day. I thought it would be helpful to my job search if I read this book some years ago 
1	"I think this book is good, because it is more enlightening than thinking, because there are no certain rules in the world, and the United States is good and cannot cover the development stage of China. The foreign students who did not return to the United States gave us an internal speech a few days ago. In short, they said how good human rights are in the United States. At first they agreed. Later, after thinking about it, they found a problem, that is, ""high welfare, universal suffrage, and inviolability of private property. ""As the basic point of the preaching, the best is the best, but it does not have a universal perspective. The so-called one yin and one yang say the way has not been broken. Say no more, readers know it. "
0	The mold is very ordinary, there is no air intake for the cooling fan on the back, and when I went to mention it, I was told that I bought it without anti-virus software. Reconciliation? 
0	The memory is small. I'm a bit stuck in CS, I don't know why. The heat generation feels a bit high, but it is acceptable. 
0	The rooms and the front desk service are good but the hotel is too old, the rooms are not as good as the general 3 star hotels, the balcony bathroom is very small and the location is not good, the garden swimming pool is very small, especially the restaurant in the hotel garden, it is called Donghai fisherman or Donghai fishing village It’s too dark in the market for 8 yuan a catty of sea melon seeds. He sells it for 50 yuan a catty. It’s less weighed and tastes worse. A plate of fried cucumber costs 18 yuan. It’s an open-air stall environment. The table is peeling and shaking too much 
0	The room arrangement is very unreasonable. You have to go through a far away kitchen to reach the room. After smelling the smell of cooking in the kitchen, you can't rest in the room; the double bed room can't access the Internet, but the standard room can access the Internet, which is unreasonable; Service attitude is also very average. 
1	After using it for a few days, it feels good. It has basic functions such as wireless, Bluetooth and camera, which is enough for netbooks. Buy it on JD.com. Don't worry, it will be delivered unopened. 
0	First of all, I would like to thank Ctrip.com for its assistance. I am satisfied with this service. Checking in the Economic Trade Hotel, first of all I feel that the room is too small, the double business standard room does not meet the required standard, but looks like a single room; the sanitary condition in the room is not good, the floor is obviously plastered, etc., the foot pad in front of the bathroom is dirty ; The indoor seat feels very dirty and I do not want to sit down. 
1	The facilities of this hotel are really good. The location is also convenient and the lobby is stylish. Since there is no room type that I booked, the hotel was upgraded to a superior room when I arrived at the front desk. Overall, I am very satisfied. 
1	I bought this book because I wanted to save it. The bandit, who was going through the stepmother to the end, finally gave us a river crab ending. Perhaps it is the first time that Banda uses the first person to narrate, so it feels a lot different from previous works. And Fei Da mentioned Dongzi many times in the book, mentioning the good period, and referring to the good period like a dream...Jiaqi like a dream is my favorite book. I read it ten times and shed tears ten times... …So I mentioned it many times in this book, which made me feel sad. If you really like this book, you might as well say that you like it. 
0	Because I like this movie, I look forward to the original book more, but the pirated version of this book can't be added. I have been out of anger, so I don't bring such a deceitful person! 
0	"The lobby of the hotel is like the lobby on the first floor of a residential apartment. The bedroom of the so-called ""suite"" is smaller than any five-star standard room I have ever stayed in. The two beds are close to each other within half a meter. The annoying thing is that the bathroom is so small that two people can fight in it! This is the most rubbish suite I have ever stayed in. It even sold for 807 yuan a night, which is really worthless for the RMB! Such a hotel under the Howard Johnson Group of the United States really smashed its own signature! Ctrip, please carefully examine the true situation of each customer that signed the agreement, and don't let Ctrip's loyal customers be deceived again and again! Additional review June 16, 2008: A very disappointing hotel with low cost performance! Hotel Feedback June 20, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay at the Howard Johnson All-Suite Hotel in Shanghai, and for your sincere suggestions.

1	The soundproofing is poor, and people outside the room can speak clearly. Anything else is okay, dare to have any extravagance in Ganzhou 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the speed is very fast, the most important thing is that it is super convenient to carry, and the battery life is very strong! 
1	I especially like the swimming pool and fitness place. The transportation is convenient. It is close to Pazhou Complex and also close to Teem. The breakfast is pretty good, but I have not eaten other things in their hotel, so I won’t comment on it. The overall feeling is still satisfactory , Will go to live next time on business trip. 
0	1. It takes more time to install XP. 2. The workmanship is average, but it is worth the price. 2. The voucher sent by Jingdong must be more than 3000 to use, which is very uncomfortable 
0	Checked in last month, nearly 500 yuan a day, the bathroom is very small, like a budget hotel. The hallway room smelled of musty. The drain pipe of the bathtub was leaking, dripping everywhere. Less than 30 meters outside the window is a residential area with constant speakers. What's even more ridiculous is that I was told at the checkout that the room rate booked by Ctrip did not include the service fee, and an additional 10% service fee was charged. I have booked so many times with Ctrip, and I have booked a lot of Five Stars. This is the first time I have encountered it. In short, the hotel is poor and the room rate is unreasonable! 
0	"I thought it was so pretty. Alas, he was really a ""well-intentioned"" author. I posted a lot of wrong English pictures of our Chinese people. I didn't laugh to death, and I was ashamed. Some articles are purely I think they might still be compiled. For example, when I talked about watch aunt, is it possible? ? ? Unless it is deliberate when joking, it is difficult for anyone who has studied English at junior high school or above to make this kind of mistake, right? After reading a few stories, my enthusiasm was greatly affected. I wanted to read it as a joke book, but I didn't expect it to be difficult to laugh. . . "
0	I bought this book for my nephew. I thought it would be a very thick book. At least the content is not that little and monotonous. When I received the goods, I opened it and I was disappointed. It was not worth it. Compared with the price, this book is too worthwhile. 
0	There is nothing new in this book from structure to plot to text. It is a typical online literature. If the requirements for novels are not high, it is purely for the sake of understanding, maybe it can be done 
1	Beautiful appearance, excellent workmanship, good keyboard feel, complete functions, configuration to meet general entertainment office, led screen, ddr3, are more mainstream configurations, fingerprint microphone, camera, card reader, Bluetooth, rich functions, the most important thing is The price of this brand is absolutely the champion of cost performance! Strongly recommend buying! 
0	The biggest disadvantage: the pre-installed suse linux system is too difficult to make, the interface is very beautiful, better than vista, the configuration is too difficult, the wireless network will not be set up, and there is no stock software that can be used, and we can only prepare to install xp. Linux partitions are quite difficult to delete, so they are sent directly to the after-sales service. 
1	I buy books, I read books, and I talk about books. This is a very important thing in my life. Now that I have children, I pay more attention to books for educating children. I also introduced many mothers around who bought this book. The impact is great, and I continue to practice the theories in it, but there are many times when I cannot do that myself. I have more books, but I feel that I owe more to my children. My intelligence, habits, and emotional intelligence seem to be imperfect, but I am also happy. I have paid for it and taken care of it. I have met the best in the world Love is my child. 
1	I bought it at a discount, 4249 free package and anti-virus software. It feels very cost-effective, and it is easy to use, and I trust the big Lenovo brand. I hope it will be stable and durable, and I hope Lenovo’s service will not let me down. 
1	I haven't finished reading this book yet. I need to read it and think about it for a while to help it really digest. But I can say with certainty that it is a very helpful book for me. I am more determined to learn Chinese medicine by myself. Among them, the more impressive ones, such as the tracing of some keywords, gave me a very shocking feeling. It turns out that every word contains much wisdom of our ancestors. We should all return. Abandoning traditional culture and Chinese medicine will make us lose our cultural roots. Angelica! Angelica! 
0	I decided to buy it after reading the reviews for a long time. I got the book and I was disappointed. I felt that the names of the chicks in it were too difficult to pronounce. I couldn't remember it clearly, and I didn't read it smoothly. What about the daughter that arrived? The picture also looks messy. I read those names and it’s not smooth, and the stories inside are not attractive at all for children over 2 years old. Only put it aside. On the contrary, I later The set of <Naughty Little Grid> I bought, my daughter liked it very much, and after pestering me to tell the story inside, she would still hold it and flip through it by herself. When she got her feet up while measuring her height , I will also say: Xiaoge is like this. In her opinion, she is the same as the naughty Xiaoge. She has done a lot of naughty things, and she has a common sense. Recommend to everyone ! 
1	1. Superior battery. 2. Good appearance and craftsmanship. 3. The keyboard feels comfortable. 4. The speed is acceptable. 5. The battery is not prominent and well designed. 6. The built-in software is also more practical. 
1	Zhonggui Zhongju hotel, but the location is very good, the price is acceptable, I should stay here next time 
1	"For reasons known to all, I have always resisted Japanese culture deep down in my heart. The education we receive is more negative than positive. However, with the increase in reading Japanese picture books, my perception has changed a lot. In the book, we can also see their reflection on history, attention to children's education, and reflection on human nature. For example, Gong Xida, such as the ""Fox's Fairy"" I saw today, there is only a touch of love and joy in the book. It is beautiful to look at pictures, and to read words is also a beautiful enjoyment. For children, it is the best love Education, no need to say more. "
1	The author's logic is rigorous and he did it in one go. Without a word of nonsense, explain the profound things in a simple way, follow the temptation and follow each other. I have a headache when I see the indicator illustrations on weekdays, and I feel like I am inspiring. As expected, Zhanhao's golden game is worth looking forward to! 
1	The configuration is high and the price is low. The built-in Samsung DDR2-1G-800 memory is much higher in quality than the Tongfang V80 touch tool sold in Tokyo some time ago. It has high technical content by touching the function key. 
1	The quality didn’t say, it’s aimed at Xiaohei~Perfect screen~~HOHO~~ But after installing XP, the power drive and keyboard sound control keys don’t work, it’s still under study~ 
1	I bought this for my colleagues in the office. The screen is perfect. It is very good. I am a regular customer of JD.com and I am quite satisfied with JD’s service. 
0	The room is really small and has a musty smell. The sheets were not cleaned and there were unidentified stains. I called the housekeeping department and asked for a change and no one answered the phone. I could only call the front desk and sent me a sheet. I asked to put it on. The waiter said I am the front desk person who is not responsible for making the bed. The housekeeping staff is off work, so I can only make it myself. Looking at the above evaluations, digital TV is more attractive. I think there is really nothing to watch. There are so few movies stored, and serials cannot be opened at all. Will not live next time. 
1	The location is a little bit, with some ethnic customs! If you have a chance, you can try it 
1	A very thin set of books at a very cheap price. But when I got it, it exceeded my expectations. A lovely story, a period of fun experience, not just preaching, just two ugly little guys, let our children know how to get along and know how to live in laughter. I really like it~~~ Now Ou Jia Xiaobao will read a book as long as he calms down, and even looks at it when changing clothes. . . A very fun set of books. . . . Xiaobao is literate a lot, so he doesn't need to be read by an adult. . . Very good~~~~~ I hope more parents will read this book with their children~~~ 
1	Yes, the room is large, the facilities are relatively complete, and the location is very convenient. The TV is slightly worse. 
1	It came the next day after placing the order, praise! Better than expected, a good netbook, fortunately, the configuration is a six-cell battery, which is good enough. 
0	It doesn't feel like a hotel, like a hotel. . . The towels are old 
0	The content is so-so; the printing production is very bad, I don't know what garbage paper and ink is used, it is very smelly, it smells bad, and you can't get close at all... 
0	I have been staying at this hotel on a business trip to Chongqing. Although breakfast was almost negligible, but the most recent time, their behavior made me uncomfortable. Obviously I didn’t consume anything, but insisted that I consumed it, which made me very unhappy. Can't help it. 
1	High cost performance, the appearance looks pleasing to the eye, all the functions that should be provided, and the perfect screen is obtained, happy ing 
1	Generally speaking, it is okay. Several shortcomings: 1) The bathroom smells bad; 2) It is inconvenient to use, and you have to walk across the bridge to greet on the street. 3) Chinese restaurants are expensive 
1	After reading Edward’s gift, I really feel that I have benefited a lot. It turns out that people and things encountered in life and work can be explained in such interesting language, and they can summarize opinions and opinions, and can also use various different Way to use. For individuals in their future careers, they can use the things that seem insignificant in life, but affect the career development of the work methods and methods, so that they can achieve such a perfect workplace. A great book, a book A word that awakens the dreamer? A good book. 
1	Yes, the surroundings are very lively, convenient to travel, and no worries about finding a place to eat. You can take the 973 bus to Repulse Bay, Stanley, Ocean Park (main entrance), and the station is nearby. The rooms are small, but the price is acceptable. The bellboy service is very good, and they are very helpful in asking directions, even though the Mandarin is not very good. But the lady who stayed in the lobby felt that it was not suitable for the service industry. It's not that the attitude is bad, but there is no smile without saying, and the brow is always frowned. 
0	I just want to say that I won’t live here anymore when I sleep on the road. When I enter the room, there is a smell. But the plane arrived in Beijing at 12 o'clock in the evening, and it was almost 1 o'clock in the hotel. Since I haven't eaten dinner yet, I asked the front desk that there is a 24-hour delivery service, but the delivery phone will never get through. In addition, there is no broadband in the room. Tell me if I want to go online to the business center tomorrow morning. I am dizzy... ...What's the age. Anyway, staying in this hotel is like going back to the 80s, everything is bad, the location is not good, the cars in the alley are not allowed, I dragged big bags and small bags to walk in by myself! The key is still dirty !!! I really don’t know why Ctrip recommended this hotel to me 
1	The comrades in arms should support Brother Hao's series of books, and hope that Brother Hao will continue to express his experience and experience, so that the skills of his comrades can be improved! 
1	The carpet in the hallway is very soft and comfortable. The waiter's service is also very attentive and very good. I feel that the management of the hotel is in place. The breakfast buffet on the first floor is a little bit monotonous. But the Oktoberfest in the open air at night feels very good, the cool wind is blowing, and a drink is particularly comfortable, mainly because it is relatively hygienic. 
1	The hp that I use myself can boil eggs. Many of my friends use Toshiba, which is resistant to manufacturing, good heat dissipation, and has many advantages. 
0	Pay attention to buying things in Jingdong Mall. If the items are okay, that's great. Orders are delivered in time, but if you need to return or exchange items, a long and painful process will begin. . . 
1	Silver frame, good-looking and good workmanship! ~ 2. Ben Shuang 4200, fast speed, good graphics card, can cope with mainstream games, the LED screen is quite good, the display effect is good, the brightness is high, the new 16:9 wide screen is not bad. Fast delivery and high efficiency are worthy of praise! 
1	The appearance is very high-grade, if there is red, it is just right for girls, very beautiful. . The configuration is high in the same price range and very affordable. 
1	Stayed for one night. Very good hotel, no matter the environment and facilities are very good, especially some small details in the room, people feel more comfortable and convenient to live, if the price is more popular, I believe it is a good hotel! 
1	The facilities are not new, the rooms are medium in size, all with a side view of the sea, and there is a non-smoking floor. Breakfast is relatively ordinary, not many choices. 
1	During my five days in Hong Kong, I called Regal Oriental Hotel my home. The service attitude of the staff was very good. The rooms on the third floor were newly renovated, although they were small but very warm. In the hotel, the aunt who cleans up the house gives free coffee bags and black tea bags every day, and makes a phone call to complete everything efficiently. The surrounding environment of the hotel is quite lively, because Kowloon City is a gourmet paradise, so don’t worry about eating, there are dazzling dessert shops, tea restaurants around, reasonable prices and good service. Although not close to the subway, buses extend in all directions, which is far more convenient than subway transfers. 
0	The battery life is slightly insufficient; the shell is plastic, and the right palm rest will creak; when the optical drive is pushed in, it seems to be stuck, which is unfavorable; the price is reduced by 500, and it is perfect. 
0	I can only say... horror..., there are actually two doors in the special room, although they are not too big, they also make you sleep well... 
0	Vista needs to adapt. The partition is strange, but according to customer service, data can be exported even when the system crashes. 
1	In the Thinkpad brand, the price/performance ratio is relatively high, and I feel that the heat is a little too large. Others are good. The time drive sound is loud when starting up. 1G of memory is really not enough. It is recommended to add a memory directly when buying. 
1	Read this book and find it very useful. This is a book about psychology, and many of the problems it talks about are close to life, such as what I have experienced or the people around me have also experienced. I feel inspired by the soul to some extent, or, in other words, like an experienced elder telling you the truth of life, revealing a certain overwhelming difficulty encountered in life, telling Your solution. For example, the book mentions delayed gratification, which is very useful, and it provides a new motivation when I encounter bottlenecks in the learning method. 
0	Well, Linux is not very used, but you can reinstall XP. After all, this model is 100 meters cheaper than XP model, which is very good value. The piano paint on the outside collects fingerprints, but just wipe it with a cloth. 
0	Shoe stays are pitifully scarce in Yunnan's contracted hotels. We should work harder to open Home Inns everywhere, or else those of us who suffer from shoe stays can't find a place to live. Like most local hotels, Internet access is very luxurious here, and you have to live in a business room. When booking a room, the shoe support said that the card cannot be swiped, but it can be swiped at the front desk, which is more convenient. The room was just average, and there was almost no hot water, which prevented the Ruan family from taking a bath for two days. The breakfast is very poor. Regardless of whether the porridge is dry or fried rice is cooked, as long as there is rice, there must be sand. Elevators are sometimes out of service for unknown reasons. There is a supermarket downstairs and the environment is average. It's not too far to walk to Erhai Park or Mingzhu Square. It takes about 40 yuan to get to the airport by taxi, and about 35 yuan to the ancient city of Dali. Dali’s taxis are in the city by metering and bargaining outside the city, resulting in a serious phenomenon of decapitation. From the development zone to the People's Square in the center of Xiaguan, it only costs 6 yuan, just out of the starting price. The service level needs to be improved. When I checked out, I could not see the scroll in the paper tube in the bathroom. I had to ask Ruan if I had taken it away, NND, who would be interested in their bad thing. It is recommended to friends who want to stay in hotels in Dali. There are many hotels in the development zone and they look good. It's okay to rest here the first night, and then find a place to live by yourself. 
1	Location: Quiet and convenient transportation. There is a small supermarket in front of the door with everything available. Laoya fans snacks, and the hotel restaurant food is also good. It is 5 minutes walk away from Jiuguang, 20 minutes away from Nanjing West Road shopping mall Henglong Plaza, Westgate, CITIC Pacific, parallel to Huaihai Road, shopping on the street is super! Room: I live in a deluxe double room, the environment is good, clean and sanitary, 24 hours hot water, heating and cooling air-conditioning, and magazines for reading. The only catch is that the TV is a bit small. The service attitude is also good and can promptly respond to customer requirements. Will live next time I go. 
1	The hotel’s room types are relatively limited, but the business standard rooms are still good, and the facilities and services are still in place. However, the room I stayed in this time is the outermost room. The temperature of the room is relatively low, the heat preservation is poor, and the self-service breakfast and The lunch taste is okay and the price is moderate. What this hotel does not lack is that although the customer source is remote and there are fewer taxis, it is the most convenient to go to the development zone. 
1	I don’t know if it’s a hard drive or something. It’s been running. It’s not stopping, it’s rhythmic, and you can listen to it as a drum. It’s normal after taking it to ASUS after-sales service! ! Angry~! ! ! I'm so angry~! ! ! It would be a loss in case it gets caught and closed for a year~! ! ! ! 
0	For those who go to Taiyuan for the first time, hotels are hard to find. No taxi knows. There is a musty smell in the room, the towels are really bad, typical state-owned enterprise. I used to be skeptical of online reviews. Now I know that I was wrong. I also want to tell what I met. In addition: Why doesn't Ctrip sign cooperation agreements with hotels such as Jinjiang Inn or Home Inns? Everyone makes money! Cooperation is believed to be the last word for future social success. 
1	Only after reading the first chapter, I can’t put it down. It describes the principles extracted from many phenomena, and makes the book more accessible through examples. Even so, this book is not at all popular, but everyone living in the world will I have personally experienced one of the things mentioned in the book. Reading this book has triggered me to think more about what life is? I have encountered very unfair things before and suddenly realized the truth and understood Why did the situation develop like that? Suddenly, I learned a lot, and I also saw a lot. 
0	The shell is completely a fingerprint collector. The battery life is much shorter than the nominal 9.5 hours after turning on the Bluetooth, etc., and it feels like about 6 hours. Of course, it is much better than ordinary netbooks. 
1	I stayed in a single room, the room is a bit small, but the facilities are still very complete. The location of the hotel is quite satisfactory, and the level of service is not bad. 
0	Tell us how to achieve their goals step by step with their own efforts in today's highly competitive environment, especially foreign companies. Of course, the main person, Lala, is very cute. We have to learn from her serious and persistent work, always good at summarizing problems when encountering problems, and good at dealing with people up and down the company. 
0	The quality and printing of this book are good, but it is only suitable for children under five years old. My child is eight years old and seems not interested in this book. In addition, this set of books is a bit expensive. 
1	The appearance is quite stylish and cost-effective! The design is very fashionable, the real machine is more beautiful than the photos, it is recommended! 
1	The room is really cool, the legendary 2104, living alone is still really big. Except for this, there seems to be no other advantages. I want to take a shower when the train arrives in the morning. The air conditioner is not available, and the water is sometimes absent. The strangest thing is that you have to push down the small switch instead of pulling it. This is a new world I discovered. , I even asked the front desk ignorantly. The vacuum cleaner tripped during cleaning. Breakfast is really not called breakfast. There is nothing. 20 RMB is too worthwhile. The elevator bursts slowly, and you have to smoke a few cigarettes while waiting for an elevator on the top 21st floor. But the waiter is good. But a lot of unhappiness was obliterated by the beautiful scenery and the smile of the waiter! 
0	Had a bad stay, but never lived so bad! ! At 00:00 last night, a young woman caught her husband and raped her in the room, yelling and screaming, trying to live and die, so that everyone did not sleep well all night. Remind everyone that the hotel's confidentiality work is very good! Live at ease. 
1	It was the first time I booked a room with Ctrip. I lived in Chang'an Hotel very comfortably and the dining was very satisfying. The price is only not much lower than the front desk price, not too competitive. 
0	Why hasn't my book been received yet? Isn't it not posted. Shipment is displayed on the 12th! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
1	After using it for a few days, the overall feeling is okay, no problems are found. Jingdong’s speed didn’t say, place an order the night before, and pick up the next day! 
0	"It has been a month since I bought it back, but my son has only watched ""Gulu Gulu Zhuan"" once, and didn't even turn the other pages. The painting is too full and it looks a little messy, and the picture does not interest him. The book is too big to be easy to turn over. "
0	I bought ACER 4935G, all of them are LED screens, and the quality is obviously not the same. The screen of this 4736Z seems to be the same, but the effect is much worse when I look closely, I suspect it is a snowflake screen. 
0	We have 5 people, including foreign guests. We stayed for a total of 2 days. The service attitude at the front desk is very cold and makes people feel bad. The room is clean but I feel sorry. One of the four-star signature counterparts did not use the service guide book in the room , I didn’t even open the check-out but was said to have left a ballpoint pen mark on the service guide asking for a compensation of 40 yuan. Because I rushed to catch the plane, I paid angrily and left after the argument was invalid. This kind of service attitude is really disappointing next time. I shouldn't choose it again 
0	1. Poor sound insulation! Any movement outside the corridor is clear, the problem is that you don't have to rest! 2. All towels have a smell of smoke! do not know why? This is the third time I have lived, every time. And the towels are surprisingly hard. Hotel feedback April 12, 2008: Thank you for your review. The sound insulation of the hotel has been improved through your review. The towel lotion method has been adjusted. The softness of the towel has been changed by adding softener during cleaning. 
0	The indicator light is not obvious, there is no uppercase and lowercase indicator light, no Bluetooth indicator light, and the built-in camera imaging effect is poor 
1	The hotel is relatively old and the facilities are average, but the service is quite good and the price is reasonable. Recommended. 
0	My order on November 6th has not arrived today! Dangdang shows that the transaction has been completed! What is going on! Order number: 1421846721 I placed my order on November 6, which has not arrived today! Dangdang shows that the transaction has been completed! What is going on! Order number: 1421846721 I placed my order on November 6, which has not arrived today! Dangdang shows that the transaction has been completed! What is going on! Order number: 1421846721 
1	The performance is good, 03 ran for 15,000, and others have not yet run. The WIN7 driver can be automatically searched, and the XP driver is also easier to install. Others are being reused. 
0	Very bad, quite bad, so that our foreign guests are very angry! ! ! The service does not meet the standards of a four-star hotel! 
0	I stayed in this hotel during the medical exhibition. The room facilities are still relatively new. But the hotel does not supply hot water from the time I entered to the day I stayed. Think about the price of more than a thousand, and I lost it. It is shameless to repair the pipeline in Dalian. I have confirmed that many of my friends’ hotels during the same period have not been affected. The hotel’s explanation is very reluctant. When I booked, I guaranteed it with a credit card, and they did not cancel my stay, nor Give a discount, when I said force majeure (our flight landed in Shenyang due to weather, the hotel did not cancel the reservation for us, causing us to take a taxi to Dalian overnight!!) This is angry. Ctrip is also very bad, even such a big thing Don’t tell me. All in all, it’s so shameless to stay here. Additional comment April 14, 2007: I forgot to say that this hotel charges too much, 0.8 yuan per minute when surfing the Internet, it’s robbery. 
0	Overall, this hotel is still affordable. I came here in March and the waiter service was not bad today. I came to the front desk to register and said that the hotel system upgrade did not have the previous information. I need to re-register. Once again, I went to find a few times, and the lady at the front desk said: Isn't it fixed? Bad attitude. I am also a regular customer, too bad. The white and gray bags of the room decoration are still stacked in the corner of the room, and they will be replaced tomorrow. I will not live again next time. The hotel manager must strictly manage it. Early is not bad. 
0	The service is poor, the room is luxurious but it is also very average... 
1	The room environment is good, the polite service at the front desk is also in place, praise! 
1	The location of the hotel is very good. This time I stayed in the 2002 room, opposite to the sea, very beautiful. The front desk service of the hotel is in place. Because I had to take the 9 o'clock ferry ticket to leave Weihai, I stored my luggage at the front desk. The waiter was very friendly. give it a like! Ctrip's price/performance ratio is not very high. The 300 yuan standard room does not include breakfast, but there are fruits from Ctrip, which is okay, haha 
1	The hotel is too far from the city. It is not close to the new international exhibition. My guests are fairly satisfied. 
0	Very poor sound insulation, difficult to find, old factory renovation, small reception at the door almost found the hotel next door, Shanghainese stingy 
1	The room is ok (I live on the 21st floor), but the air conditioner is not very good-the temperature is not well adjusted and the noise is not small, and the shower water volume is not very large. In addition, there are too few elevators in the hotel, only two can be used. It takes a long time to get to the elevator every time. I don't expect to live again next time 
0	I don't know much about computers. The system installed by others helped me. I heard that it is difficult to install. Besides, after using it for a while, it gets very hot. The power supply is also easy to heat up 
1	Perfect Samsung screen, Samsung memory, change ide to xp, install sata driver, everything goes well, the sound quality is good, better than my friend’s Sony 
1	The workmanship is exquisite. The details are handled well, especially the workmanship of the brushed control panel is very strong. The multi-functional media keys feel very good. The screen is relatively strong. The touch-type volume control keys are very good. 
0	In Jiujiang, it is a rare hotel with a larger scale. Checking in on National Day was terrible. When I returned to the room in the morning, two waiters were in the room, and one of them was using the toilet! Seeing people entering, they quickly locked the door, knocked on the door to let them come out, ignored them, and flushed the toilet when they came out. After the complaint, the tall, thin-faced foreman surnamed Wu said that they guaranteed that their waiter would not use the room toilet. Ask him what guarantee? Can't answer. I also said that the waiter was using the toilet phone to call home. I said that the toilet phone in the morning was broken. The foreman quickly said that the waiter was actually using his own cell phone. Sophistry, terrible! Finally asked me what I want to do. I said you were solving the problem, how did you ask me? Your hotel doesn't even have a minimum attitude! Finally, I told him that the attendants of the four-star hotel are not allowed to close the door when cleaning the guest rooms. How can the attendants ensure that the toilets of the guests are disinfected and hygienic? Do not want to delay the day's itinerary, check out and leave. The hardware of the room can only be said to imitate the facilities of a four-star hotel. The materials used in the decoration are very poor. I have never seen a listed 4-star hotel use such cheap materials. 
0	I forgot to add one point: the author of this book has a problem with his brain. When he speaks nonsense, one can tell that the author is an idiot by looking at the language of the book. It is ridiculous that there are many scriptures quoted in it, which seems to be added by the editor. It is strongly recommended that the author be brought to justice, and the irresponsible publishing house should be directly taken over by the state. This is too harmful, a typical pseudo-science. 
1	After staying in Jinquan for a few days in December, I started to book a deluxe business suite, and later changed to a business standard room. I feel that the price ratio is better: the size of the two rooms is not too different. You can rent a cat from the hotel for free through the power cord. Internet access is very fast. 
1	The price is cheap, and the appearance and configuration are good. Although there is no accompanying system. But it is very convenient to include the windows series driver! 
0	I have stayed in the worst hotel in Henan during my trip. The hotel is very old and dilapidated. The room is not well lit and the bathroom smells bad. Except for the Xiangguo Temple, it is not very close to other attractions. Maybe the city of Kaifeng itself is full of dust, and the hotel seems to be gray everywhere. The free breakfast buffet has nothing to eat, but it's pretty full 
1	1. The price is cheap and the configuration is better. 2. The workmanship is OK, the screen is good, the hard disk sound is light, and the keyboard feels good. 3. The bag is thinner, it's okay, the buckle is metal. 4. The memory is a single 2G, easy to expand, like one. 
1	Although the room is small and equipped with all the internal organs, we stayed in a sea-view room, which requires an additional 400 yuan. It is meaningless to live there without a sea-view room. The morning tea in the Chinese restaurant in the morning is more pleasant and delicious. Shopping around is more convenient. 
1	Nice hotel, very affordable, in line with suitable market positioning, quite convenient in Shijiazhuang 
1	I think the description of the birth stepmother phenomenon in this book is very appropriate. This phenomenon often occurred in the author's time. It seems that there is no such thing as going to the mountains and the countryside in modern times. This phenomenon will not happen, but it is not. Many young parents now place their children in their hometowns for work, or their parents go abroad and place their children in the country, which will cause the birth of stepmothers. If parents have this kind of experience themselves, even if their children do not have this kind of experience, they should pay attention to their own education methods to prevent their own experiences from affecting their children. Therefore, it is recommended that young parents read this book. 
0	It is very inconvenient to contact without a 24-hour free service phone. Please solve it as soon as possible. You only answer the phone from 9 to 21 every day. Are you in Europe? We are at work at 7:30. God is at work. Do you still have to sleep? Wait for God to wake you up and give you money? Change it soon, please! 
1	The room is OK, the special suite is very good, but the restaurant is too dirty and the breakfast is out of appetite. 
1	The price is relatively high, the appearance and feel are quite good. The heat dissipation and the sound of the fan are a bit loud, but it does not affect the use. The floating keyboard is still great. Generally speaking, it is quite satisfactory. 
0	The exterior and lobby of the hotel look good, I had confidence in it, and it’s in the city center, it’s easy to travel, but it’s a nightmare from the moment you enter the elevator, the elevator doesn’t look like a hotel at all The elevator, and from the elevator to the room, there is a strong and unpleasant smell. It is disgusting. I booked a standard room. The facilities are old and simple. I can't praise it. I also say that it is a Samsung. I think it is only better than The guest house is a little better and the charge of 248 is simply too much 
1	"Today I read Chapter 8—The Arrow of Time. The article reads: ""The future is not just a possibility, it is actually something we have now and now. And we have the future because we can have it now The state that can lead us to the future: needs, goals, and projects."" ""Another aspect of human superiority: we lose more when we die."" Sometimes we think about the meaning of life, but the answer is different each time. Roland understood the problem of life from the perspective of time, and led me to a new path, that is, the arrow of time—an arrow directed toward the future. "
0	The literary talent is really good, but there is a problem with character. The world's great wonders. It seems that I understand the animal side of man again. 
0	"I used to live in the ""Kowloon Hotel"" in Tsim Sha Tsui when I went to Hong Kong. I had a very good impression. Apart from the smaller rooms, the traffic was really convenient! Just come out of Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station. This time I went to Hong Kong and wanted to live in a hotel in another area, because I prefer SOGO, so I wanted to choose a hotel in Causeway Bay. I checked everyone's comments on Ctrip, and because I was rushed to make a reservation, the ""Seaview Hotel"" that I valued was gone, so I chose ""Hong Kong Island Empire"". Facts have proved that if this hotel only needs to add more than 100 yuan, it is really impossible! You get what you pay for the price~~~~ When checking in, the front desk had a bad attitude and slow action. At first, I only offered the double room. Because my mother and I didn’t sleep well, we insisted on the standard room, so we gave it. The innermost room on the 16th floor (1601), the bathroom in this room is very problematic, the shower and sink drain are broken! The problem with the shower head is that the bracket has been loose due to the long-term use. As long as you put it on, the shower head will fall off, so you can only take a shower with one hand when you take a shower! And the sewer plug of the basin cannot be controlled manually. As long as it is plugged, it cannot be taken out. It can only be pried out with a small knife. My small fruit knife was also damaged. Asked to change the room, was told that there is no standard room, only a double room, and I don't know whether it is true or false; the repair report also said that the repair was not good in one or two days, so I had to do it and use it. Let’s talk about its traffic. It’s not near or far from the subway station. It’s 6 or 7 minutes to walk. I’m still full of energy when I go out in the morning. It’s okay to walk. My feet are sore when I go home at night, but I can’t walk. , Think about it better than the Kowloon Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui, above the subway is the hotel. Another point is the distance to SOGO. Ctrip stated that it was 0.5 kilometers. My mom and I walked for 25 minutes in a daze. Half of the time, I couldn't have a rest in Xu Liushan, otherwise it wouldn't work. Finally, let’s talk about the hotel’s environment. Netizens commented that this hotel is very noisy at night and must live on high floors. Originally, I thought I lived on the 16th floor. I thought it shouldn’t matter. Who knows it’s still noisy at night. This is because of the street in front of the hotel. At night, it is considered a bar street, not the authentic ones. After a few steps, I saw women dressed as ""magnanimous"" sitting in front of the bars. Those bars have thick curtains, and they will not be quiet until the early hours of noise! Although there are a lot of dissatisfaction with this hotel, it also has a bright spot, and we must also praise it: the free shuttle bus H1 of the Airport Express has a stop at ""Hong Kong Island Empire"", so it is very convenient to come and go. There is a special car directly on the Airport Express. Next time I go to Hong Kong, I don't think I will choose this hotel again. "
1	The perfect screen~ and give away the package~~ Very cost-effective! It takes less than 24 hours from order to receipt! It's so fast! 
0	Very ordinary inspirational books, the kind that are everywhere on the street. Deceived by the beautiful packaging. It took an hour or so to read it, and there was not much content. I regret it now. 
1	The appearance is quite fashionable, and it feels good to get it in hand ~ I am generally satisfied. Asked to reinstall the XP system quickly and added 2G of memory. It's pretty smooth now! 
0	Obviously don’t laugh, I’m an English vocabulary book. The content is very general. It feels like a piece of book. After I bought it, I read the comments on Dangdang. Please also use snacks 
1	It's still a very good hotel in Changzhou. The location is very good, just a 5-minute drive from the railway station. The hotel has a certain history, and the facilities are slightly outdated, but the service is very good. The waiter delivers newspapers every day, and now occasionally snacks are also delivered. Flowers are given on birthdays. Ha ha. In fact, for men, it is more practical to send some fruits. Haha, is it too harsh? 
0	The purpose of buying this book is to let the baby know what can't be done, and to educate the baby with this kid as a typical negative. Unexpectedly, the baby’s reaction was fear, and I regretted buying it for 23.8. The book is big and the pictures are big, but David's paintings are not cute at all, and he often grinned to fill the whole picture; and the color is not the color that 2-year-olds like, I think it is a bit disgusting. After only 5 pages were told to the baby, the baby said that he was afraid and did not want to read it. I can't comment in vain that this book is not good, I can only say that it is not suitable for a 2-year-old child like my baby who is less courageous and yearns for happy and beautiful things. 
1	"This book is basically my family’s guide to eating arrangements and disease prevention, not only for children, but also for adults. I have a full set of Ma Yueling's books. This is the best book for taking care of children. I have bought many books by Ma Yueling for my parents and friends. Sometimes when I see a child with a bad complexion, I cannot help recommending the book ""Parents Are the Children's Best Doctors"". I hope everyone will benefit from it. The best idea of this book is to improve the child's physique. This is not an overnight task. If you persist in doing it and do it right, your child will gradually become stronger. "
0	The text is boring, non-artistic, and difficult to catch the eye. Turning a page, OVER! The ancients said: No book is worse than nothing! Here I would like to say: It is better to believe in advertising than no advertising! 
0	"When I wanted to buy it, I only placed an order after seeing a lot of good reviews. I didn’t expect that it was not as good as others said. Especially the one that beats the monster. The drawing is so disgusting! The child was scared to cry when he saw it! I dare not sleep! I bought a book and brought new troubles! Compared to ""Frog Frog"", ""Bumpy Jumping"", ""Little Bear Maomao"", this Carmela is much inferior! This book is not It is too suitable for children before the age of six. "
0	Super horrible hotel, after entering the door, it is not a big room of 45 square meters at all. It is very small. And, it is very dirty, really dirty. It took 2 hours to wash and disinfect by yourself. When I just took a shower, I found a lot Cockroaches, big and small. Even when combing the hair, I combed out a small cockroach from my head. It was terrible. I was fighting with cockroaches all night. In the morning, I didn't even want to eat their so-called breakfast. I quickly left and changed to Sunshine Hotel. And just opened, the waiter's attitude is also very blunt. 
0	Acer's heat dissipation is still a problem. Without the setting of the cpu fan speed, the cpu temperature is only 44 degrees, the machine fan will not stop, and the noise is louder. Like the friends above, the wireless signal is not very good. 2-3 frames lower than my usb network card. The arrow keys in the lower right corner seem a bit fragile! 
0	I don't feel very good about this hotel. Let me talk about the shortcomings first: 1 The subway is under repair at the door, which is very noisy. 2 The decoration of the hotel is known as the perfect combination of avant-garde and classic, but I personally find it flashy. 3 The hallway of the room is dark, and I can't see my fingers. 4 The Ministry of Commerce collects money for a broken computer and a broken stool. 5 The restaurant of the hotel is outsourced, it is very inconvenient to eat, and the breakfast is very very poor. Advantages: 1 The bedding and pillows in the room are very clean. 2 Good location, in the business district of Hangzhou. 3 Check-out is delayed until 2 pm, probably because of the low occupancy rate. 
1	There is no pre-installed operating system, which saves money. Alone, it's cool to play games. Installing the XP system is also quite simple. 
0	Within a few days after I bought it, I found out that the noise of the speaker as a selling point is special. It is normal when using headphones. If you use an external speaker, no matter what sound is being played, there is noise in it, and it is not a bit, it is like something broken metal Murmur. Go to ASUS after-sales test and say that the speaker must be replaced to solve the problem 
0	I thought it was a book for children. Even if some parents educate their parents how to read to their children, it’s not bad. I didn’t expect it to be a preaching book. Unfortunately, I will understand the intention of the introduction shopping guide next time. I don’t know if I can return it. ? ? ? 
0	When I arrived at the hotel at night, the lights in the lobby were all turned off, and the guests were reluctant to turn them on. As soon as the forefoot entered the room, the massage phone for the back foot came in, Niucha! Socialism is good! 
1	Reading Ange's books and watching Ange's photographic pictures is like following Ange's journey north and south. It broadened my horizons and learned a lot. I have been looking for my own direction, but in the process of reading, I gradually opened my mind. I want to travel, I want to travel all over the world, I want to write down my thoughts along the way, I want to live my life...many dreams, Let me, who are still struggling, move forward with strength. Recommend this book to my friends, I believe they also love it, just as I love this book. 
0	"We checked in on 6/23 (Monday), I live on the 5th floor, the room number is forgotten, my evaluation is extremely poor 1. We checked in at 10pm that day, the front desk was not staffed enough, 1 waiter, I was in front of you For the two customers who were going to check in, I waited 15-20 minutes to check in. 2. There was no free water in the room, but later the waiter helped us bring it. 3. The worst thing is the cleanliness of the room. Sheets, sheets, and pillows all leave things that are suspected of ""menstruation"" or ""semen"". The former can clearly see red areas, while the latter is irregular. The block makes us feel very sick. 4. The only ok is that the waiter is asked to change the sheets and sheets. The hands and feet are quick and the attitude is kind. In fact, I have complained to the waiter on the same day and asked the waiter to respond to the hotel. Embarrassed and sorry. 5. The Great Wall is a 4-star hotel, and we hope it can be above 4-star. Hotel feedback August 11, 2008: Dear guests, hello! Thank you for choosing to stay at this hotel. We apologize for the situation you encountered during your stay. The management of the hotel takes it seriously and has requested the relevant departments to be reasonable Allocate the working hours of front desk staff. In terms of room hygiene, we also order relevant departments to strictly control the quality of linen washing and strengthen the sense of responsibility of the staff. Finally, thank you for your valuable comments on the hotel, we must actively improve, and welcome you again with a new look. "
1	This is a very meaningful book on sexual enlightenment. I bought it for my child when it was first published, and read it with the child to guide it positively. I think my child is sexually enlightened. In this respect, they know more than other children, without curiosity, calm mentality, and can look at some things that happen in the growth process with a normal mentality. Today I bought it for my friend’s child. I think that through this book, more children can understand some of the mysterious things they face when they grow up, but it should be normal. 
1	Very good hotel, friendly staff, new hotel facilities, comfortable living, worthy of four stars. It is especially recommended that the catering is very good, whether it is dine-in or delivery, it tastes good and the price is not expensive. I will live in his house when I go to Xi'an. Additional comments August 10, 2008: write one more point: very cost-effective. Ctrip's price is very advantageous. 
1	Blue, elegant and beautiful, the size and weight are just right, lighter than ASUS Easy PC. I think the font is acceptable, the LED screen display effect is good. The fan is very quiet. 
1	1. It is small and easy to use, especially suitable for girls; 2. The heat dissipation is also really good, and the hand feels only warm for 4 hours, about 40 degrees; 3. The built-in software is very powerful. 
1	To be honest, I bought this book purely by accident. I saw the comment on Dangdang.com-a Chinese medicine practitioner who touched millions of people... This evaluation is really worthy of the name. I have always paid more attention to the topic of health preservation and Chinese medicine, and I have read relatively more books and materials in this area. But Teacher Luo's book makes people shine. Use the most popular language and simple way to tell the most profound truths and the heritage and civilization of Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. I like this book and Teacher Luo's language style. After reading this book, I often follow his blog. I can say responsibly that this is definitely a good book worth reading again and again. 
1	The frosted face is good, looks calm, and feels very textured. The keyboard feels much better than before, and the layout has not changed much, so it is very adaptable. 
1	I went to Kyoto to mention it on the 9th. The price is good. AMD's cpu performance is good, and the memory is a bit small. I bought a 2GDDR2 800 memory when I bought it. The small switch on the touch panel is more convenient, and the wireless network card switch is also very convenient. The camera and mic have not been used yet 
1	The room area is too large, resulting in poor cooling and heating effects of low-power air conditioners, and the distance between the bed and the TV is relatively difficult to watch. 
1	This time it is the 308 executive big bed, the overall feeling is very good, but the price is a little bit higher, there is a five-star deluxe room next to it, only 398. It is estimated that Little Swan is only available in this room type. It is obvious that the room I have stayed in before is really bad. If you want to live here in the future, let's choose this executive big bed! 
0	Everyone must not stay in this hotel; the waiter there seems to be you owe money; especially the front desk; it seems like you killed their whole family; but the charge is indeed a 4-star charge; the air conditioning in the room is like a tractor; I I really don't know that Ctrip is getting worse and worse now.' I can only go to a hotel every time I go to an agreement! 
0	It’s better to have dos pre-installed so that it’s more convenient for me to change the system and consume more power~ It can only be used as a game book~ 
0	I booked through Ctrip to check in on August 13 and confirmed the pick-up. No one picked up one hour after I arrived at the airport at 9:45 in the evening. When I contacted the Ctrip staff, they said that the hotel had sent someone to pick me up, but they made a mistake on my mobile phone number. What a joke is that the pick-up at the hotel does not require a sign but a mobile phone? Moreover, the previous few times I stayed at the hotel were picked up with a placard. The work error is not terrible. It is just that Ctrip and the hotel staff work together to deceive customers and treat them as fools, which lacks the most basic professional ethics. 
1	Good workmanship. The sound quality is good! Good heat dissipation! Jingdong delivery is OK, I placed my order on the 15th and received it on the 17th morning. (Add some here. To be honest, the graphics card of this machine is too low, but the machine feels calm and firm! Another point. The left palm rest is a bit loose! Then there is the battery. You can tell if you take it out. , It’s smaller than my Tianyi’s! Jingdong doesn’t send the mouse away, and when will the word limit be changed!) 
1	The configuration is first-class, and I copy five minutes of files on my F8. This machine only takes 30 seconds to handle it. The cooling fan is quiet enough, the appearance is beautiful, the screen is good-looking, and the graphics card is not so powerful, which is very cool. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, and the view from the window of the sea view room is also beautiful. You can see the trestle bridge and Xiao Qingdao, and the beach is across the sea. The service is very considerate, I like the snacks on the floor. The room settings are also very thoughtful. Although not big, but a good resort hotel. The fly in the ointment is that the soundproofing facilities are not very good, and it is more miserable when you encounter neighbors who are making noise at night. 
0	It was clearly written in the advanced version of VISTA, and only when I got it, I found that it was only the normal version! Obviously said 2 points and kilograms, get a hand to 3 points a few kilograms! Amazing! 
0	After seeing a hundred forums, I became interested. Because I was busy with work, I only read a little bit, so I bought a book to make up. But I fell asleep after watching. It's better to buy discs, lively. 
0	We checked in through Ctrip on May 1st. The conditions were too bad, and it was not up to the four-star standard. Everything was very old. The bathroom faucet could not be turned off after running out, and the paint on the bathtub was all off It is estimated to be a four-star ten years ago, in short, I will not stay next time. Hotel feedback June 1, 2008: Our hotel was officially listed as a four-star hotel in 1994. Four floors were gradually renovated in 2006 and 2008. The guest rooms are of different grades and the equipment is different. Welcome users to choose us next time. Newly renovated room. 
1	The configuration is okay, the price is acceptable, but the drop is a bit fast. When I bought it, it was 4099, and it was 3999 a day later. 
0	The pre-installed vista runs a bit slowly, and there are too many pre-installed software. If it doesn't work for a while, I still change XP. The heat dissipation is average. 
0	Many friends around me watched it and said it was pretty and interesting. I bought it and read a few pages, and found it didn't match my taste. I don't like this type of historical novels, my wife is too teasing. 
1	Checked in the legendary room 04, the scenery is really beautiful, catching up with the good weather, the blue sky is all in sight:) After the checkout, due to the stress of work, the credit card was forgotten at the front desk, and the staff of Ctrip soon notified me , I am very grateful to the front desk staff of the hotel and Ctrip sales staff for their serious and responsible work. Next time you come to Weihai, you will definitely stay at this hotel! 
1	"The book has been out for a while, and I want to ask my child for advice, or give it to a younger child, but she disagrees because I want to watch ""I Don't Want to Be Angry. Think about it, this emotion is not something you can manage after reading it. Although the content seems simple, there are really not many books that can tell children how to deal with this emotion when they encounter this emotion. "
1	In fact, I first read this book from an online mobile phone e-book, because the phone screen is too bright and hurts my eyes, and I read it sloppily. But the love story in it is very touching, and I shed tears several times. It's really sad to see the end. I hope the third child and Jing Qiu can come together. Although the tragedy is more impressive, I still hope that this story will have a happy ending. Ugh! I hope they can come together in the next life. To fulfill a dream of those of us who love this book. 
0	"I have a lot of affection for the city of Tianjin and the old hotels in Tianjin, but this time it really disappointed me. I have lived in Lishunde, I have a good longing for the old hotel, but this one does have too much to improve! ! How else can you let the customer visit again? The location of the First Hotel is very good. It is very quiet at night. The rooms are very tall, but there is a strong smell of smoke in the hallway. I changed two rooms and remained the same. I entered the room at 9pm and opened the window and the door for ventilation. At 12 o'clock in the night, I closed the doors and windows and went to bed. I still feel uncomfortable. Maybe I don't smoke, because I am very disgusted with the smell of smoke. I had to put the perfume I brought with me by the pillow so that I fell asleep. The smell is not good, which greatly reduced my impression of the cleanliness of this restaurant. The waiter does not serve at all. When changing rooms, I asked me to run up and down with my luggage, and told me that there was no one at the front desk and I couldn’t walk away. I went down and took a look. What about the three sisters? no one""? I said the room is smelly, and she told me ""Impossible!"" Could it be that I can't make it by myself? The breakfast is really expensive, I'm too sorry for its price. In short, very disappointed, will not live again. "
0	Since it is dedicated to games, it should be driven by XP system! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
0	The familiar hotels were full, and I had to stay again. It was more rubbish. In short, if it is not a last resort, do not stay in a hotel. The pillows were black, the sheets were yellow, the room was super small, the bathroom smell was similar to the public toilet, not to mention the room smell. 
1	It’s the first time I met Long Yingtai and read her book for the first time. I never thought that mothers and sons would communicate in this way, and understanding, of course, was also caused by their unique situation. In the book, mother and son discussed a lot, worldview, outlook on life, and values. This is a spiritual communication. Nowadays, few mothers and sons, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, and fathers and daughters can communicate in all aspects. I am really envious and very envious. I am jealous, and I hope that in the future, I can communicate internally with my children. Learned a lot, it is worth recommending, even if it is childless and unmarried. 
1	".After reading the ""Digital SLR Photography Bible"", I have benefited a lot. I hope that the author will write ""Bible 2"" to further deepen the theory, teach expert skills to the people, and let people share the charm of photography. "
0	The new machine doesn’t seem to support USB booting. You can only install the system with a CD-ROM drive. It’s too easy to get fingerprints. It hurts. The power adapter gets hot easily. Just send a mouse pad. 
1	"A love call transfer made me like Lin Xi’s writing style even more. This ""So you are not unhappy"" makes me no longer want to put it down as soon as I pick it up. The content in the article is based on real life, the current people’s living conditions, for me For this kind of office worker, it can be said to be a spiritual purifier. Walking in a middle management position, there are bosses to obey, and subordinates to coordinate. This is a dangerous position. If you don’t do it well, you will be embarrassed. I am exhausted physically and mentally, and the article ""Forget about me is soft"" has benefited a lot. I am very grateful to this book for teaching myself to relieve some of the burdens that I should not have, and to be a lighter person. "
1	The works inside are very cute. Compared with previous books of this type, there are more practical designs inside. Not only limited to dolls and large ornaments, but also admire the creators, because the craftsmanship is really great, because you will know that after trying it, it is not easy to hook up a delicate and small baby. Very happy thing. Ou's second work is obviously smaller and more detailed than his debut. I am currently learning to hook smaller accessories~! (*^__^*) Hehe... 
0	I have always been buying books and I don’t like listening to bookstores. I have never planned to buy this book, but I have been hungry on Dangdang. Every time I buy a book, I recommend this book and I want to buy it again. . I can't stand it after reading less than 50 pages. It's a complete crap. . . . . This can be said to be the worst book I have bought since I bought it. 
0	It's not as good as everyone said. It feels a bit far-fetched. It's not easy to help memorize. I can learn English, and I find it difficult, not to mention that I have not learned English to gain readers, I think. 
1	The heat dissipation is well done, the screen is gorgeous and there are no dead pixels, and the Dolby surround effect is also very good. Changed to XP+3G RAM PS, Dreamweaver opens quite smoothly. The function keys are very practical and the interfaces are quite rich. . 
1	Perfect screen after self-test Samsung's memory Seagate's hard drive. The appearance is more beautiful, enough for home use. 
0	Some male chauvinists seem to feel very uncomfortable in their hearts. People should be independent. In order to maintain a marriage relationship, and always live a life centered on each other, sooner or later, they will lose themselves. 
0	One of the worst I have ever stayed. The room is extremely stuffy, and there is a lack of oxygen at the plateau, and being stuffy in the room can easily aggravate altitude sickness; 2. Crude. The mattress on the window is crooked, exposing the wooden bed frame; 3. The toilet is more dirty than a guest house with dozens of yuan. The toilet lid is connected with iron wire. The flushing device needs to be lifted before it can be used; 4. Some waiters have a bad attitude. When I checked out, I carried a huge bag and asked the waiter if I could hurry up a little bit. I was stunned. In short, if you are not afraid of death, you can come and live. 
1	"Recently, I was commissioned by several senior college students and bought several copies of ""Easy Introduction to Digital SLR Photography"" and ""RAW Complete Analysis"", which is really good! "
0	I have stayed in the worst house in the family. When I checked in, I said that the room was not cleaned up. I had to wait 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, if I didn't take the initiative to ask, no one would inform you that you can move in, maybe another 40 minutes! The standard room B is on the first floor. It is small. It doesn't matter. The smell in the room is heavier. That's all. The key lies in the rat infestation in the room! There was a loud noise in the toilet at 2:30 in the middle of the night. It was seen that a piece of the toilet ceiling fell off, a small cement block fell to the ground, and a huge mouse fell off. After jumping around in the room, he crawled back. Encountered this situation once in a hotel, it was really disappointing! It is recommended that Home Inns take care of this matter and eliminate rodents. Because I lived in Luoyang Rujia (Wangcheng Park Store) the day before, there is a real difference between the two! Hotels in capital cities! I hope I can stand up! 
1	Unimaginable near West Lake, young people have to walk for 10-15 minutes. Because the window is not facing the West Lake, the Jing basically can't see the West Lake. You have to put your head out and barely see the lake at the far end of the commercial street. 
0	It has been less than a week since I bought it, and now the price has dropped by 300. I bought it at 5799. It's disgusting. 
1	This book is by far the most useful book I have bought in Dangdang. The crochet, which I thought I would never learn, has actually made me interested in hooking things through this book. I have hooked five toys to Tongbao according to the book’s design, including bear, kitten, small wooden horse, Little sheep and piglets. And by referring to the patterns found on the Internet through the stitches he learned, he hooked a pair of small shoes to Tongbao. It was a sense of accomplishment, so I would like to like it first! However, there are small mistakes in the book, but they do not hinder the knitting. This book really played a role in being a fisherman! 
0	It is a pity that it is not the advertised 1441X800, the word is small! In addition, when I mentioned it on the spot, there was dust on B and C, and there was a lot of dust, which is unimaginable! I was psychologically murmured, maybe it was not the factory inside who took the shell module to the house to install it! 
1	A man in a developed country who loves to climb the peaks, children in some of the poorest areas, they will never overlap, because of an accident, they are connected. After drinking three cups of tea, they became friends. For a school, this man lived the life of an ascetic monk, and the local villagers would rather sacrifice their animals to defend the school they were building... In many poverty-stricken areas, there are also children who are eager to study, and I hope that more people will help them so that they can have a broader world. 
1	One additional sentence: The pictures in the book are clear and easy to understand, but most of the photos and examples are politicians and celebrities. It is natural to think of whether these body language skills are really practical for ordinary people or ordinary people in social situations. Suggestion: Read selectively and choose the skills in the book carefully. After all, China is not the United States, the Chinese are not Americans, and the habits of the Chinese are different from those of the Americans, and different from most countries in the world. 
1	very good. One of the best hotels in the country. Good in every way. 
0	In fact, the whole book wants to say that when it is not too late to start reading for children. (This is known before I buy this book) There is no real answer to the question about reading to children. Many questions are said and not said the same. There is really no need to waste time watching. 
1	The price is not cheap, but Samsung memory and original mouse are provided, compared with the price advantage 
1	"To be honest, I am definitely a 100% ""angry young boy"". I can say that I don't like the Japanese. For the ""little Japanese boy"" Murakami, I am quite convinced. I have read two of his books and read it every time. Reflection for a long time. . . Although the characters in the novel have nothing in common with me (you will know that the age of the protagonist is mostly concentrated in the adolescence of 20 years old and the overall personality is relatively strange after reading the characters described by him), but I don’t know why after reading it Later, I will still find resonance and reflect a lot every time. . . . Anyway, I recommend everyone to take a look "
1	Regarding Wu Xinru’s book of macroeconomics, I decided to comment again: I don’t know how influential his book is on the market. Perhaps many college students bought this book because it is East China Normal University Economics. Please refer to the designated reference book for postgraduate entrance examinations of related majors. Although I have not read this book thoroughly, the overall feeling is not bad. The only thing I feel uncomfortable about is the printing and layout of the book. It is not too comfortable for people to look at... Students majoring in major economics should carefully review the two books by Ye Delei. This book is not the focus, so please read it carefully when you have enough time to learn. 
1	Every time I go to Taiyuan, I live in this hotel. . . As far as the level of Taiyuan City is concerned, it is good; however, compared with other cities horizontally, the price-performance ratio of this price is obviously insufficient. 
0	The power adapter generates a lot of heat and the noise is a little bit, not too obvious. The weight is also a bit heavy. If the price is lower, it is really a machine king. 
0	The CPU almost meant it. . If the P8600 is cool. . But the price is there. . Strong sense of plastic. . Especially the keyboard part. . The left button of the touchpad is not easy to press. . Just one click may not respond. . It's a bit loose. . There may be tricks. . Ha ha. . 
1	The traffic is very convenient and the environment is acceptable. The breakfast provided is also better, just a bit older. Overall it is satisfactory. 
0	This is a collection of novels. I have read many chapters and stories. The book printing is still good. But it is better to buy the whole set, a little regret. 
1	I think the level of the translator is average. If it weren't for Agatha's good reasoning, such writing would not sell well. It may be due to language. Among the series of Agatha’s inferences I bought, this is my favorite. This book has a strong narrative and lacks a lot of hard dialogue between English and Chinese (the translator’s translation is weird, which may be due to the direct translation of English into Chinese. It does not conform to the Chinese speaking habits, nor does it have the essence of English. I believe that Agatha's English is not that naive!) So I seem to be very involved! The storyline is really great! 
0	The attitude of the lady at the front desk was not good. When the room opened the door and walked in, there was a moldy smell, and the glass of the balcony door was broken. When the cheak out, the front desk made us lose money, saying that we had broken the door. The lady at the front desk rushed up and said that the guests next door complained that we were too noisy and asked us to register as a guest. The attitude was a mess. The next door is a guest. Are we not guests? And as soon as we opened the door, the next room was noisier than us. It's just one word anyway: bad! 
1	Quiet environment, close to the railway station. The rooms are well furnished, and the breakfast is mainly Chinese and rich. Stay next time 
0	The original work is okay, but it is just a set of general books after being translated into Chinese; I don't know why so many people say it is good, I also bought it after these reviews. 
0	The restaurant is very poor, and the level of dishes is not good. The hotel basically does not have tourist supporting services. In fact, there are many attractive tourist attractions in Henan, but there is a lack of corresponding services. 
0	It feels silly for acer to give up the volume knob of the old gem and adopt the current button type. Could it be that the tuning button is too expensive or has too many bad reviews? Suggest that acer get that thing back. 
1	The configuration is not bad at the price of 2899. I just got it yesterday, and the system was installed very quickly. I tried it and the heat dissipation is good. 
0	The screen is still relatively small, and the eyes are a bit tiring to look at for a long time, and the system needs to be reinstalled. It needs more professional people. An amateur like me still can't handle it by myself. 
0	It is really sad for the Chinese people to be touted such a bad book preaching conspiracy. It is another fast food reading, as boring and nutritious as junk food. The writing is too poor, the story is very general, lacks depth, lacks ideological connotation, and the author's level is still too low. I guess no one will mention this book in five years 
1	I have always disliked Japan as a nation, but I have always had a strong interest in his culture, and I have learned a lot about various aspects of information, but they are not systematic. The four Japanese books describe anthropology, culture, politics, and history. A collection of works by scholars in various fields and with deep ties with Japan is really great. I have a very comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and history of this nation! Many of the viewpoints are very profound and predictable, and they are often new! Needless to say, the content of the book is worth buying and collecting. 
1	I have read a lot of books about Bandit. To be precise, I bought a lot of them, but there are 2 books that I haven't finished reading or dare not finish reading the most beautiful love in the world. In the end, it turned out to be miserable and people can’t help but sigh. My mother’s work, I really like the latter part of the underworld, there is a beautiful love, and the good ending makes people full of fragrance after reading it, but if I want to say that it is not as good as the previous one, it is also a short story. At that time, Mingyue remembers that there is a writing in it. Yang Jiumei, Yelu’s and Ji Xiaofu’s are very moving. Hope that most bandits write books of this style to satisfy our readers. 
1	Brand advantage, meticulous workmanship 2 Good CPU heat dissipation, low sound 3 Both USB ports are available, the design is more reasonable 4 The keyboard is more comfortable 5 Comes with 1G memory 
0	Very general, not recommended. However, the title of the book is very good and misled me. I have always been in favor of reading to children and developing the habit of reading. 
1	Inter's SSD hard drives are super fast. Now you don’t need to put your laptop on the table carefully after you turn it on like before, you can pick it up and use it everywhere, and you don’t have to worry about the hard drive failure due to vibration! The all-aluminum shell is beautiful without leaving fingerprints. 
0	My baby is 3 years old. I just glanced at the book set I ordered and was not interested. Maybe the pictures in the book are too messy and she doesn't like it. 
1	My colleague asked me to buy the original book. She is a national secondary psychological counselor, and she is also a very competent mother. Her daughter has just turned 4 years old. According to her, this age is good for receiving family education. When the time comes, she often buys some books for children to read. My colleague said that the content of this book is written around the author’s daughter’s growing up experience. Among them, the author’s practice can be used as a reference for parents in family education. Generally speaking, it is worth reading that after the child goes to school. Purchased. 
0	VISTA games are really slow! ! ! You can't steal food if you have fun! ! ! It took 10 days to change XP 
0	In general, the hotel design is more distinctive, but the service is really average. 
1	Close to Gongbei Pass, standard rooms are too small, deluxe bed is good, service is good, breakfast is not good and too sloppy, others are good 
0	It is more troublesome to reinstall the XP system, the standard system disk needs to modify the SATA mode in the BIOS, otherwise the blue screen 
1	I bought it at 4599 and gave it a bag. The whole is blue and pretty. I haven't found any problems after using it for 1 day. But after I bought it, the price was reduced to 4555, which is good to wait for another 2 days. 
1	The location is good. It is very convenient to take the Star Ferry at the entrance of the hotel to Kowloon. You can walk along the overpass by subway. People who are familiar with overpasses and promenades can easily live there. The service is also good. I booked two rooms this time and upgraded to a sea-view room, which was really good. I will choose this one next time I go. 
0	The Vista system is really not easy to use, and there is no system disk. The piano lacquer is very different, but it's too dirty. There are many handprints and scratches. I decided to stick a film and use it again. 
1	The room has free fruits every day, which is better. There are also many books and photography works in the room. It is said that the chairman Heqing wrote and shot himself, so talented. 
1	It is dignified and durable, not outdated, with sufficient configuration and excellent value for money. I placed an order at 4999 hours two days ago. I picked up the goods on the last deadline yesterday afternoon. The system has not been changed and the battery is not charged. But now I have some funds. I like a 2530p. I want to sell the one I took yesterday. Contact me if you want, so the bills are all available, and you can check the goods at the JD self-pickup point. The price is at least cheaper than the current online price. QQ: 710959285, Mobile: 13591477314. 
0	The service is too bad, there are too many mosquitoes in the room at night, and the human care is not good 
0	Some netizens mentioned the shortcomings, which is not obvious to me. Fever: I used it for 2 or 3 hours in the current weather of about 28 degrees. It didn't feel very hot. It was a little hot, but it was acceptable. CD-ROM: I have a bit of vibration here, but it can be accepted, but I did not try to burn the disk. 
1	I rarely read online novels, but many friends around me read e-books. Later, a careful policeman recommended this book, saying that it was occasionally seen in the university and thought it was good. At first I laughed off, and when I saw it in Dangdang, I thought it was cheap and I bought a book for him. However, when I watched the protagonist move a little bit in the choice, when the author wrote that everything finally turned to be flat, I felt that it was everyone's business, not as hypocritical as the online novel in my mind. I closed the book, saw the passage on the cover, and said what I meant, I couldn't help laughing. 
0	NND, the summary can only be written in 100 words, not enough, see the summary! One, the workmanship is rougher! The sense of plastic is very strong, the whole is a plastic washbasin! The joints of the fuselage are large and uneven! Second, the piano paint is easy to get dirty and easy to scratch! Needless to say, the fingerprints were scratched after only two days of baking! 
0	The palm rest on the left is hotter, much hotter than the right; it takes too long to confirm the transaction completion, it takes 8 days, so the efficiency is too low. 
1	I was a little busy lately until I finished reading the whole book last night. I was shocked, especially when I read that the wolf was about to migrate. I didn’t understand what is stubbornness and what is rebelliousness, and what kind of character it is, until Chen When Chen had to kill the little wolf himself, I almost cried, human wolf, what kind of feeling is this. Just like the comments given by others, the wolf totem makes people have the courage to admit their own potential weaknesses, and what people urgently need in today's society is not a character like a wolf? This is really a strange book. 
1	The location of this restaurant is very good. I come to do business, whether it is to the administrative agency or to the client company. It is very convenient to go to the administrative agency or the client company. The staff's service attitude is also very good and the efficiency is very high. I think this hotel is very new, but it is still constantly The perfect decoration shows the attention of the hotel and the strong strength of the group. 
1	"If you buy and read the book in the order of publication, when you see this book, it is not only viewed as an ordinary book, but as a collection. Although it is not a cultural relic, it is worth putting it in the bookshelf. Read repeatedly. Sometimes I think that each book in this set of books is like an introduction, always attracting you to keep reading, keep buying, and keep adding to the bookshelf. Incorporating ""Ma Weidu Shuo Collection. Miscellaneous Chapters"" in the bag will bring a perfect end to this set of calligraphy and painting, whether it is meaningful, practical, or ornamental. "
0	The book was ordered on June 14th, but it has not been delivered until today! The delivery staff called at noon last Friday to say that it will be delivered immediately, and on this Tuesday, they said that they will be delivered on Wednesday; except for the above two calls Besides, no one saw it. I was in Shenzhen. Normally, I should receive the goods within a week. It has been half a month now and there is nothing. This service is too problematic. 
0	1. The workmanship is unsatisfactory. When the screen is turned on, the camera will ring (the panel is stuck in). Reluctantly accept it, and it will not affect the use; 2. The hinge of the screen has a place where the cover will move, but it will not affect the use; 3. The DVD drive is generally made, and the sound is relatively loud when reading the disc; 
1	I plan to show it to a few friends. Even if it is already working, there are some things that I didn't want to understand, so it would be beneficial to take a look. For those who have not experienced anything in the workplace, give some mental space to prepare. There will always be upsets at work. Everyone will be frustrated and shocked, but everything will pass. The key is what is left for you after you pass. After that, will you and me be more mature than before... 
0	The design of the heat sink on the left is a failure. The sound effect is amazing when the operation is at full speed. The sound effect is thrown out by top products such as Harman Kardon Alte Bluestar. Shen 
0	The carpet is dirty and the springs under the mattress bulge out. Sleeping is uncomfortable. Very poor soundproofing. Very noisy. Some distance away from the city. It is not very convenient. I think it is terrible. Great but disappointed after entering the room. Why is there so much difference inside and out. I originally planned to stay for two days and then checked out after staying for one day. 
0	Use the evaluation of a professional elite to express your views on this book: the readability is not bad, and it is particularly fresh for students who have just entered society. But to some people who have been working for many years, it seems very numb... 
0	The graphics card is 64bit, which has certain restrictions on performance. It would be nice to have an XP disk attached, too heavy! Installed an XP and worked for a long time. 
1	No driver CD is configured. This is very bad. Although the notebook itself is burned. But it also troubles customers. 
0	The heat dissipation is really not very good. The graphics card says that 3450 is installed with the driver and the display is 3400. There is no Tongfang service gold card, only a battery extended warranty card. It would be even better if we send the bag and mouse. 
0	With more mirror processing, it becomes a fingerprint collector. HP pre-installs too many fancy and useless software, which wastes resources and slows down speed. This price book does not send a bag or a mouse, it is the simplest one. 
1	Books and firearms are the same truth, the key is how people who master her use it. Reading all is just a bug. If you decide to do more in society, it’s just narcissism; knowing how to use books is more or less enviable, and at least it can make others trust him to do something; thick black, if used to kill time, at least Can be used to talk about; to be able to deal with life and work, enough, enough, don't bully others, at least live comfortably, enough. If it is used to harm people, it is not the fault of the book. I just hate the book when I see it too late, better than not seeing it. 
0	Workmanship needs to be improved. The gap at the upper left corner of the joint seam is too large. This is obviously a deformation of the Lens. The double-sided tape underneath alone cannot hold the lens, causing a large gap. Hope that subsequent batches will improve. The battery is slightly loose after being installed, and the size of the battery latch cannot be controlled. 
0	Unfortunately, the book I sent yesterday was returned by me. The reason was that when I received the book, I found the book was broken in the middle. I ordered three books. The book was caught in the middle but it was badly damaged. Obviously it was before mailing. It has been damaged. 
0	The driver program is incomplete, especially the problem that the AHCI of the hard disk cannot be opened, and later solved with the driver of IBM. The sound card needs to be installed twice before the driver can be installed, and the corresponding video card (HDMI) needs to be installed again for the second time. 
0	The service is very poor. The lady at the front desk has not been trained at all. I said to extend the check-out time --- 1 or 2 noon is fine, but I told me that a half-day room charge would be added for more than 12 o'clock. This is the first time I have encountered a 5-star hotel in the country, and it is generally no problem to check out at 1 o'clock. When I checked in, the hotel delivered pedicures, which were claimed to be worth 98 yuan, but it was not worth it, and the service was very inferior. I did other items, but I couldn't charge the hotel account. I had to pay in cash and not give me an invoice. Additional comments July 17, 2008: When I saw someone complaining about Taxi, I also remembered that the driver refused to carry the car number Joan A-45153. The letter may be wrong, but the number is correct. 
0	Typical online novels~ People with plenty of time can read it! After reading it, the characters inside don't know what they are like, and they don't know what personality they are. The characters flash by, and forget everything after reading it! The plot of the story goes over, and you know if you win a battle, how you fought, and the scene of the fight. Very disappointed, decided not to watch anymore~ 
1	In Baoding, it should be said that it is the best hotel, and the restaurants there give the hotel a lot of points. 
1	"It feels good to read the 20-year-old version of this book from my colleagues. I searched on Dangdang website by the author’s name and found it was out of stock. Later, I found that the book of the same name without ""looks"" was published by the same publisher. I ordered a copy with the idea of giving it a try. The official result was that "" The book I want to order is temporarily out of stock. I hope Dangdang will improve the product information as soon as possible to facilitate readers to subscribe. The book is very good. It introduces the core content of the Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic in a relatively simple and easy to understand way. But for people who are new to this knowledge, it seems that they need to read it several times to deepen their understanding. "
1	Very good management! The detailed service is in place and highly recommended! It feels like an old hotel. 
0	The book I received seems to be a pirated copy. I only turned a few pages and found several typos and printing errors. Depressed! 
1	But because I have bought a Lenovo notebook before, there shouldn't be any problems, plus so many things are given away. 
0	This hotel is really bad, very bad! The room is big, but it looks unclean. It is estimated that it was changed from the old guest house. 
0	"To ridicule history in modern commercial language, and put it down after reading the first page. In terms of historical content, it is similar to Luo Guanzhong's ""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" or Er Yuehe's ""Yongzheng Emperor"". Even to the extreme. A further level of ridicule gives people a sense of disrespect for history and makes people have great doubts about the authenticity of its content. If it is an ordinary novel, it is humorous. Humor is okay. It is unacceptable to be so laid out on historical issues. It always makes people feel that the atmosphere of reading nowadays is becoming more and more impetuous. It is true that fewer and fewer people are willing to calm down and concentrate on reading. Publishing organizations and authors have adapted to this trend in other elements, but in the content elements of the book itself, it is more and more neglected. "
1	"I have always liked to read books about history. ""Those Things in the Ming Dynasty"" is frequently seen in bookstores, and it is always in a prominent position, but I am not very cold about the popularity of the Internet. I bought a book during the holiday and wanted to read it. After reading the first one, I found that the author did write very well, and he had to write about the serious topic of history without heaviness. It can be seen that the author did spend a lot of thought, perhaps just like writing in the preface. Said: ""It is not easy to write history in a relaxed style."" Everything is hoped that readers can wander through the precipitation of past events in a relaxed way, and restore the true colors of history from it. "
1	The appearance is good, the screen is large, the display effect is good, and the screen picture can be seen clearly when viewed from the side. Fast delivery, praise! 
1	For the issue of love and sex, I talked about avoiding play and games. But logic and examples are somewhat persuasive. More truthful words will make everyone lose confidence in love and sex. However, it is worth learning to emphasize some meta-rational things. For example, men are mostly out of sexual impulse and sexual depression when it comes to love, while women use their upper body more to consider love issues, so there are often flowers on cow dung. There are other things that I don't want to say anymore. The principles in the book are worth learning anyway, but the examples must not be copied. I also hope that after reading this book, there are still beautiful images of love. 
1	The hotel’s external and internal environment is still very good, and the waiter’s sense of service is okay, but the food inside is a bit expensive. In addition, Ctrip confirmed the order time and was delayed. After taking a taxi to the hotel, I was notified that there was no room for 320 yuan. , Can only live in 520, woo. . . For those who travel on their own, it's a bit extravagant. . . . . 
1	The service is very enthusiastic, the room temperature is just right, the sound insulation effect is good, the location is excellent, the price is high, and I will stay here next time! 
0	1. Too heavy, a stand-alone machine does not count as an external power supply, which is more than 7 kg. If you add a bag and all accessories, it is nearly 10 kg. 2. The system is unusable and sometimes crashes. 
0	The temperature of the CPU and graphics card rises faster when playing games, but it is acceptable, and there is no problem in an air-conditioned room in summer. 
1	The hotel staff need to be trained, and I don’t know where my hotel is. I finally found it and told me to cancel after the booking time. But in the end I was allowed to stay. The room is a bit old, but the things are quite complete, and the corridor is a bit too It tastes good, but it is decent by Samsung standards. The location is good, there are many restaurants around, and the time-honored Yinchuan brands are all within a 10-minute walk. 
1	For some reason, I lost two of my cats last month. No, it's leaving, not losing. But it's the same as losing. I wonder if we can still get together during their lifetime? ! Never forget the way they looked at me the day they left. . . so... I bought a book for my little niece on the day. I came across this set of books by accident. I like it very much. I bought it and let it go. I flipped through it every day when I had time... as if my cat was still with me. A little sad, a little happy, and a little warm. 
0	The hotel is divided into a new building and an old building. The standard room I booked is in the old building. I have to say that the facilities in the room are too old. The carpet is no longer in color. Because of the short stay, I didn’t change it. Fortunately, the bedding is relatively clean. There is also a waiter at the front desk who doesn't seem to laugh, as if you came to the hotel and caused her a huge trouble. I stayed for 2 days, and every time I passed the front desk, I looked at her unconsciously and never saw her smile. Really dizzy! 
1	Hello, when will I see working as an accountant in a construction company on Dangdang.com? I have read all three books. I feel I want to buy the next one immediately. Your writing is so good that it makes people interested in studying accounting. Thinking about how to do accounting well. It seems that I am working as an accountant. For those of you who are going to enter this industry and working as cashiers, it is really good to buy a copy. 
0	First, there is inspiration, then the theme, and finally such a story is made up, the story is really average, and the level of some Korean dramas is about the same, it is a TV drama screenwriter. I took another look at the introduction, that the Italian award actually had a middle school student judge, and then I looked at the newspaper reviews and the development of the book, speechless. 
0	It feels bad, the room is too old and the price is too expensive, and the breakfast is poor! 
1	1. The discrete graphics card is cool; 2. The appearance is good; 3. The keyboard feels OK; 4. The price is good. 
0	The free driver at the pick-up station is very real from Sichuan. On the road, I told some points for attention when first arriving in Lhasa. The hotel is very small and not the star standard of our mainland. Breakfast is ok, the bathroom is large, but the price is slightly higher. The power went out the next day, so we changed our hotel. 
0	The shape is a bit deformed and the middle is convex. The upper cover is not tightly closed, the running speed is slow, and the memory may be small. 
1	"Performance, appearance, feel, and heat dissipation are all right. After installing XP, everyone will still encounter the problem of not being able to shut down. Just set the ""Allow the computer to turn off this"" in the power management of all USB Root Hub properties in the universal serial controller. Just remove the tick of ""Equipment power to save power"" "
1	"""Eating"" is a very important part of every child's life, and playing tricks on eating is probably what every child expects to happen. This little book fits children's psychological characteristics very well, and the writing and drawing are full of wit, so children's love is self-evident! I personally feel that it is suitable for children between 1.5 and 4.5 years old, especially for children who are more picky. In addition, it is also a good choice to read and play as a fun piece of parent-child reading~ Relatively speaking, the price is slightly more expensive~ "
0	The front desk staff is not only bad in English, but also in Mandarin. However, the service staff in the lobby bar are very good. 
1	With pre-installed DOS operating system, consumers can choose their own operating system and avoid installing an operating system that they don’t like, especially the current VISTA. With VISTA, dual-core computers and single-core computers are almost the same without a fast disk. The CPU and hard disk configuration is relatively high. The memory is a single 2G. 
0	This hotel is too bad, I will never live again in my life. The elevator is broken, the facilities are outdated, the TV is poor, the bath liquid is of poor quality, and it is totally inconsistent with the star rating. 
1	Yes, it is relatively small, but the system can no longer enter the system after GHOST. Always enter the F3 interface and constantly reinstall, so I have to manually redo the system! Everything else is fine! Buy back the next day Fell by 50! 
0	The price is low and feels very expensive. The choice of hotels is mainly closer to nearby businesses. The room can always hear the sound of water very loudly. Hope the hotel can lower the price. The current facilities are only worth 250 yuan compared with other hotels in Anhui Province. 
0	The environment is noisy and the service is not good. I gave the wrong room card when I entered the room. I was shocked when I entered the room. Someone was living. I quickly went downstairs and asked the counter to say that I was wrong. When I entered the room, the smoke level was very heavy. I said that I was going to do a smoke-free treatment. When I came, I said that the smoke-free treatment is just to remove the ashtray. The smell of smoke will dissipate in a few days. I said that I would spray with a detergent, but the smell of smoke is still very heavy after spraying, which is really unacceptable. There is a lot of mud on the road ahead. The breakfast was delivered to the room and it was not tasty. Service attitude is not good. The washing machine in the room is gone, how can I wash my clothes? 
1	"The poet writes prose, for example, when the painter draws a big picture, he adjusts his emotions with a few doufangs. In my opinion, it's a piece of cake. I chased it all the way from ""The Rose of Time"" to ""Blue Light"" to ""Blue House"". Most of his writing is his poet friend, old friend exiled to Tianya, and people around him. . . Feelings are buried in quiet words. I was thinking, probably his face is also, calm. I'm curious, should the words be in this way to be a good poet? Clean, accurate, plump, and texture. I want to say it is lifelike, but the word is too earthy. He let me read the beauty of Chinese. "
1	"I personally think that this is a book about life in the Song Dynasty, rather than a book commenting on the Water Margin. The overall structure of this book is to extract a term from the Water Margin and expand the quotation and discussion. It is more like a ""Song Dynasty Life Essay"". Conclusion: If you want to read the authentic reviews of the Water Margin, I suggest not to buy this book. This book is a partial explanation of the terms, but if you are a person who reads the Water Margin books and sees Cheng Jing or wants to know more about people’s lives in the Song Dynasty People, this book is a choice. PS: After reading this book, some people want to buy ""Shang He Tu on Qingming Festival"" to understand the details and surprises. "
0	This hotel can't compliment me. Poor room and service, but the place is ok and the price is cheap. After check-in, the first room was very noisy (the front desk must know it, deliberately), change to the second one, and the room is rainy outside (the front desk must also know that this room is leaking, deliberately), change to the third room to be stable Sleep, this hotel is so bad, the service is not so bad. 
0	It feels pretty bad, the smell is big, the price/performance ratio is too low, I will never stay again. 
0	"Several major features of Nice Hotel: high noise, poor environment, low configuration, low service efficiency. For example: 1. The sound of the karaoke hall next door is noisy until about 3 o'clock in the night, and the noise of the fitness playground will be ""enjoyed"" from 6 in the morning; the windows are dilapidated and not soundproof. 2. The TV has no Hong Kong, Macao, Phoenix, English...etc. 3. There are few front desk staff (2). The room card has been handed in before breakfast and the settlement is required. After breakfast, it is still not calculated. There is no consumption. And only we are checking out. Very few guests stay in the hotel. So four stars? Rare. It is recommended to sign a contract with the ""Gloria Hotel"" (near Nice) (national chain), and the price is also affordable. "
0	The room facilities are too old, lack of wardrobes, bathroom tiles and towels are yellow, as if they were eliminated by other hotels. Generally speaking, I am a little sorry for the price of 209 yuan. 
1	I first showed my son an episode of the magic school bus downloaded from the Internet, and then he missed the book. In fact, my son is only two and a half years old, but he likes to hear me tell him about the magic school bus. He reads one book every night, or he chooses one to read. Don't neglect the comprehension and memory of the 2-year-old. He was able to accept it very quickly, and he retelled me the words in the book: the old school bus in tatters. When watching the story of water with me, I asked myself: Where is the magic school bus? I didn't even think about this problem. 
0	No pre-installed system. It’s too inconvenient. 
1	The location of the hotel is not far from the city center and the transportation is very convenient. The lobby is decorated with some European style. Although the space is not as big as some hotels, it is very warm. In the evening, there are professional performers performing in the lobby. When checking in, a team happened to have just arrived at the hotel. The guests sang along with the performance, feeling very atmosphere, like the feeling of this hotel. The rooms are also very spacious and the service staff are very friendly and courteous. It is a well-managed hotel. 
0	It may be that the motherboard is special. Many Ghost bootable CDs cannot recognize the CD-ROM drive, but it seems that Carrot Garden can recognize it. 
0	The weight is slightly heavier. There is only one electromagnetic pen, so it would be nice to have another spare. The official website does not provide xp drivers, and the system backup disk needs to be carved by yourself, which is more troublesome. 
0	The environment is not very good, and the lobby lighting is not good. I didn't turn on a few lights, and it felt very dim when I entered the door. 
0	The special room is quite noisy. Near the high-priced bridge, noisy at night. But the room on the back is not bad, and the price is very attractive. The room is very old! The attitude of the waiter was average and he was very busy. The check-in and check-out had been waited for a long time, it took about 10-30 minutes to complete. 
0	I think it's a basically useless book. Those who like English don't need it, and those who don't like English won't like learning English because of it (I'm just an example). The seniors think it's superficial, and the kids think it's uncommon, hey! This is the first book. I also found the second book on the Internet. I wonder if it will be better than this. 
0	"Let’s not talk about the novel written by Zhang Ailing herself. Now let’s talk about my views on the book ""Lust, Caution"". The cover design of this book is okay, but when I opened the book, I discovered that only the last few pages of the novel was the real novel ""Lust, Caution"", which suddenly gave people a feeling of being deceived. The success of the company that made this book lies in the fact that it has been made in a plastic package, so that readers can't see what is inside before buying it, and they are disappointed after buying it. It is catching up with the movie ""Lust, Caution"" and it is also selling with this book. Therefore, this book cannot be called a ""book"" in terms of operation, distribution and publication, and can only be regarded as a relatively successful product. "
0	Compared to this kind of hotel, the room rate should be considered very expensive, and there is also a building next to it under construction. Work starts at 4 o'clock in the morning. Noisy people can't sleep well, and what is more annoying is that the waiter does not check in Tell you. Hotel feedback May 5, 2008: First of all, thank you very much for staying at our hotel. We are very sorry for the construction noise during your stay in the sea view room. As there is a commercial house next to the hotel that is in rush, it will affect your sleep. We must try our best to contact the construction unit and ask them to regulate working hours. At the same time, I hope you can stay in our hotel again. Finally, I am sorry again for what happened to you. 
1	This time I booked 2 deluxe single rooms by phone during the 51 period. Upon seeing it, the deluxe single rooms are like suites, with one bedroom and one living room. They are located on the 22nd floor with a wide view. There are many travel books introducing Luoyang in the living room. The location of the hotel is also possible, only 12 kilometers away from Longmen Grottoes and 1 kilometers away from the city center. The downside is that the hotel facilities are slightly older. 
0	The aspect ratio of the screen is too strange, and it is very uncomfortable to see it! The sense of mirror is too strong, I still like matte. Partition. . . Too dizzy! Put everything on the C drive! ! I really can't figure out what HP thinks. . . 
1	When the subprime mortgage crisis occurred in the United States and even affected the world, the vast majority of domestic experts in response to the crisis agreed on this, and their views were basically the same, and they were also inconsistent. Knowledge, the book tells us the ins and outs of this crisis, how our country should face this crisis, how to turn crisis into security, and turn crisis into opportunity; ordinary readers can also understand some useful knowledge from the book. . After reading this book, you can feel a different kind of thinking, which is very worth reading. 
1	I arrived at this hotel on the second night of the second year. The environment of the hotel is very good. The back mountain is the tourist area, and the front is Wuyi Square. The room facilities are average, but the service is very warm, and there is fruit delivery. 
0	No mouse package, but it doesn’t matter. It’s okay to spend more than a hundred to buy a better one. Vista is adapting 
1	"When my son just got this set of books, he just glanced at it and put it down. After a few days, I looked at it again and found that the pictures inside were very vivid. There was a lot of information in each picture. The expressions of the chickens are different. I let my son look at it, and he liked it immediately. I told me to finish all the 6 volumes in one breath. Now I want to tell it every day. He likes Carmen the most, and he always gives pointers : ""Look, it scared Berio the Lamb."" I think the pictures in this book are really good. I bought the second album for my son again. On the road, I hope it will be as exciting! "
0	For people who can only use computers but don’t understand computers, it is simply a challenge. Fortunately, there are friends who know how to help or can’t figure it out: 1. It is too troublesome to install a memory stick, and the keyboard must be removed; 2. Vista is not used to it; 3. There is an abnormal sound when the optical drive post starts, and it will be normal after a few seconds. I don't know why 
0	After reading a chapter, I left it on the side. I don’t know where to put the CD-ROM. It’s very rubbish. Many vocabularies are simply used. At least I don’t speak English like that in Office. I should speak a little bit more. In short, I won’t talk too much nonsense. The sentences in it are not practical! ! 
1	I live in the newly renovated East Building. I feel that the room is quite spacious and the facilities are good, not bad compared to the Shangri-La store next door. It's just that other aspects of the hotel, such as the lobby, the environment of the western restaurant, and the food varieties need to be improved. Otherwise the price difference is not too far, I might as well live in Shangri-La. 
0	The SATA driver provided by HP online cannot be installed at all. After installing from the inf file, the ACHI mode cannot be switched. After the BIOS is refreshed, the mouse jumps randomly when setting the BIOS, which is extremely difficult to operate. 
1	Very good product, I am very satisfied after purchase, I do not regret it, I will recommend friends to buy this product in the future 
1	Everyone needs help in life. Human nature, a casual help, although it changed the fate of three women, but more than three people participated in the benefits. While we need light, we must also do light. In fact, the people who want to choose are between 20 and 30, who are in the age of understanding or not, and most need correct light guidance. The author always tells us the truth and attitude of life in different attitudes. In short, I am very profitable, and I hope everyone will feel the same. Take a closer look at life, look around, maybe, there is light, always on, shining on you. Thank you. 
0	One word, bad, two words, especially bad, three words, especially bad. Such a four-star hotel? Please don't recommend Ctrip to us for a rebate. 
1	The rooms are clean, the location is good, and the breakfast is good. It's expensive 
1	I also bought it at 5499. I wanted to buy NN901PA but it was out of stock. I bought it after seeing the price drop. The hard disk is powered on for 6 hours, and the screen is perfect. Good luck~~~~~ 
1	The 6 of us stayed in Jinbanna for 3 nights and everyone was quite satisfied. The room is a bit small, but it is pretty good for the price. The location is also good. There is also a relatively large swimming pool. The restaurant is good. We had lunch in the restaurant once, and both the service and the dishes were very good. The only problem is that the restaurant is too famous (it was rated as the best wedding restaurant in the area, so dinners are usually packaged for wedding banquets. So we stayed for 3 nights and failed to have dinner in the hotel restaurant). 
1	I bought a few ThinkPads made by Lenovo. It feels similar to the old ThinkPad, and the quality is still relatively good. Plus Jingdong's return and exchange service, you are not afraid of quality problems when you buy large items. 
1	Through the use of the strength recognizer, I really found my differences. When I did not read this book, I always focused on how to correct my weaknesses. This is also related to the environment. Chinese culture has always focused on the correction of weaknesses, including The school teacher\parents\company, but this way I grew up living with inferiority complex! After reading this book, suddenly there is a kind of open mind, I think I am starting to create a new self~~~! Some suggestions That is: because it was translated, the words and sentences made me feel a little groggy, and when I read something useful, I felt refreshed~ 
0	The rooms are old and the facilities are simple, especially the breakfast variety is very small, but you can get enough. The service staff have a poor sense of active service, but they are more enthusiastic if you take the initiative. It may be that there are many tourists in Huangshan and the hotel business is good. It doesn't matter if you come to stay next time. The hotel has a large courtyard, convenient parking and a better environment. Because they are not professional hotels, so forgive them. 
0	The room is clean, the bathroom is large, but no facilities. There is only one towel per person, which is still broken. Overall it is not satisfactory. 
0	The performance of the sis chipset generally drags down the overall performance a bit, and gl40 can be used. Heat dissipation is not very uniform 
1	For the selection of Erhu, a series of sets should be published, which can be sold separately and purchased separately. The fine-quality erhu songs are of age and stage. Each stage has representative fine-quality works, which should be compiled by stage. The entire classic can be summarized and compiled, so that it will be of great benefit to the majority of fans, and can be treasured, and it must be deeply loved. 
1	I have bought many similar books for my children, but so far, I have found that the quality of this book is indeed better than before. It is easy for children to paste it by themselves, unlike some books that cannot tear off the sticker or tear off for a long time. Complete; In addition, the stickers are accompanied by text, which is good for children to understand some common sense of travel; the pictures are very beautiful, and children can be influenced by fashion while playing, which is definitely good for the growth of girls. Moreover, for the mother of the child, this is also a pleasing book. In short, my child and I love it! 
0	The biggest advantage is that the price is relatively affordable, and there is free parking (if you live in the ancient town, you are not allowed to drive in during the day). The waiters in this hotel all say that the local snacks made in their restaurant are delicious. I really don’t agree. The portion is small, the taste is not authentic, but the price is not low. It is recommended that friends who value local cuisine do not eat in the hotel’s restaurant. The snacks produce the wrong impression. 
1	[Recommendation] We are often told to treat ourselves correctly and know ourselves. However, few people know how to know oneself, and few people can explain this method in an appropriate way. Professor Yue Xiaodong explained his growth experience and self-awareness in adolescence in plain language, which made people feel deeply after reading and benefited a lot. It provided a good reference for self-knowledge, and at the same time, it made me start to examine myself. Is the choice of your life goal correct?&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#183; In short, it is a rare good book. 
1	"He used to read to his son, he always ran away after listening. ""Hush! ""We are Sleeping"" is the first time he has heard a story completely. It seems that this language style is more suitable for children. ""Mom, talk about sleeping!"" As soon as I got home these days, my son pestered me to talk. As long as the child likes it, it is better than anything! Of course, what I fancy most is the knowledge points inside, which are not only interesting, but also integrated into the story. It also provides a good example for me to convey other content to my children. "
0	I can be sure that the author has read some historical materials, and I am more sure that the author’s literary skills are slightly insufficient. This book has no historical reference and no literary beauty. So I asked myself why it is a waste of my time. I personally prefer Yi Zhongtian. Pin San Guo>So I don’t like the type of this book very much 
1	"Liulihuo tells the story of youth. Everyone will find their lost youth and pure emotions in the book. Worry is born of love, and fear is born of love. If one is separated from the lover, there is no worry and fear. ""What you miss will be remembered for the rest of your life, because there is no chance to know what's bad about it; missed is actually possessed, and possessed is actually a miss in another sense. Dreams always end when it is realized, because Once the dream is realized, it does not possess the attributes of a dream. The same is true for love! "
1	The price is cheap and the workmanship is not bad, even better than the Toshiba L332 bought some time ago. The heat dissipation is done well, and only the left wrist is warmed after a long time, which is very rare. Cameras, microphones, and HDMI are all available, which is very rare on a machine at this price. The LED backlit display also brings surprises. 
0	Especially with regard to the relationship between her and Comrade Director, Qiong Yao's little shadow has always been inseparable, so wishful thinking I feel very good. 
0	For personal reasons, I don’t know that the battery will be charged for twelve hours for the first three times, so the battery is not durable. But I think JD should be telling customers some common sense and precautions, not everyone knows. This can make customers' online shopping safer and more assured, and also make JD’s business better 
1	The appearance is pleasing, piano paint, pre-installed vista system, dual-core processor, 250G hard drive is enough. Equipped with DVD-RW and web camera, the 13-inch screen is good and brighter than HP's cq series, relatively light, good heat dissipation, speakers Yes, the battery can last for 3 hours, which is good for a 13-inch notebook, and the price/performance ratio is the first on a 13-inch notebook 
0	The hotel is rather biased, although it is on Dongfang Road, there are no restaurants around to eat 
1	This is my first time buying a book in Dangdang. Ordered on Friday afternoon, received the goods on Monday morning, the delivery speed is very fast. This is the book I took home to show my baby, this is her first sticker book. Once I took it, I refused to put it down. I even had to put it on my stool to eat. After eating, I clamored for stickers. I opened the book and looked at it carefully. The pictures in the book are very bright, and the content is more suitable for children between two and three years old. The quality of the stickers is also very good. A very good book. You can read the content of the book after you have posted the sticker. My daughter likes it very much. 
0	I brought it up to Guangzhou Jingdong. I have to pay for the inspection before I inspect it. Khan! After I got it, the linux system didn't go in after booting up. I don't know what the reason was. I asked their technician. The front desk told me that I didn't go to work (because it was Sunday) and the service attitude was average. Had to carry things that didn't know whether it would work or not and returned with hatred. 
1	"Concentrate on spending a lifetime, loving only one person. This is the ultimate in love, so ""Fantasy Love"" spreads such beautiful love one by one, full of color. From the initial fall in love with Zhen'er, she resisted the temptation and remained consistent, only loving each other deeply. The control and tenacity in love are really moving. Even if his heart is idiotic, so what, he knows how to love someone, and he is convinced that his love can be one-hearted people, sharing a white head. Marriage in the previous life, Chanjuan in this life. "
1	Since I did not stay in person, it was a friend. The hotel seems to be newly renovated, so it feels pretty good. The price is relatively high. 
0	When will the book arrive? It’s been 10 days and I haven’t seen the goods yet. It’s not so long before the cash on delivery. Really, I don’t feel nervous after receiving the money. ! ! ! ! 
1	Fast delivery. Brand new machine. Perfect screen. General fever. There is everything that should be. Good price-performance machine 
0	Although I thought it would be ugly before I bought the book, I didn’t expect that David’s image severely impacted my ability to accept the book after I received the book. It’s really ugly, and the image resembles graffiti, if not before I bought the book After reading the text description, many images can't understand what it means. I don't like it. I don't know if my two and a half year old son can accept it. The little guy has his own aesthetic point of view, memorizing the three-character scriptures in sets, look at his opinions at night, he likes is the most important thing. If he likes it, he will definitely come up tomorrow to comment again. 
0	"Have to comment (the local government receives the hotel, it is really a strong sense of officials): 1. Regarding breakfast: This time I checked in on January 28, 2008, and left on February 1, one hour after having breakfast on the morning of January 30 I started to have diarrhea and was accompanied by vomiting (according to the doctor’s instructions, it was food poisoning). I didn’t pay much attention to it in the morning. I took some medicines I brought with me, but it didn’t work. The diarrhea became worse and worse that night. I was sleeping, and I felt cold all over while lying in bed. Secondly, I found a doctor to prescribe the medicine and finally got better on February 1st; 1> In view of this situation, I contacted the hotel to help me buy medicine, the hotel actually asked me Think of a solution by yourself (Later, I contacted the chief mate at the front desk to communicate the situation many times before reluctantly agreeing to help go out and see the medicine I said ""Huanglian Su Tablets"", but the answer to me was that there was no such medicine in the pharmacy; in fact, he answered me Very surprised, because this medicine can be said to be available in every pharmacy, large and small, so I can judge that he did not go out and ask-what is such a hotel??); 2>This situation has happened before living here , But it’s not serious this time, and I’m not sure so I didn’t care; 3>According to the situation of staying in the hotel many times before, combined with this time I can be sure that this is a problem with the hotel’s food hygiene. For a four-star hotel, I don’t think so Any reasons and excuses that can be explained, I hope to attract attention; Supplement: I hope that the 5-star under construction will be opened to welcome guests as soon as possible. Looking forward to... "
1	The price is moderate and the decoration is ok. Breakfast is acceptable. Value for money 
1	It is a small book shared by my daughter and I. The content is a condensed version of the original, but it is complete and interesting. My daughter is still young. If she just reads the text, she still doesn't understand the meaning, and it is easy to make a difference. Therefore, the advantage of this book is that there are a large number of illustrations, which can be used to tell the baby. The effect is good. It only costs more than 1 yuan to enjoy the wonderful stories and parent-child moments. Is it good value for money? My daughter and I are loyal book fans, and I bought all the other books in this set, and I had a good time to read carefully. 
1	Because the enthusiasm for the astrology has passed a bit, now I see it intermittently for more than half, and the content of the astrological calendar is actually a bit duplicated, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of this book is that it is easier to understand, and a lot of stories are added to the astrology every month, and there is also a vivid introduction to Sangaki 28th. The disadvantage is that you often see some mistakes, such as writing Xuanwu as Suzaku and Yuan as Heng... These are relatively small places, but they make people look uncomfortable. In fact, it is a book with exquisite printing and rich content. , But not paying attention to the details will lose a lot of points... 
0	"Lu Xun once referred to some people as rogue talents, and Hu Lancheng is undoubtedly a typical example among them. If there is any discrepancy, he has one more title, it is a traitor. No matter how contemptuous we are, they do exist. The value of Hu Lancheng to us is that we can know what a real ""rogue talent + traitor"" person looks like in his eyes. They also have beautiful things in their eyes, and they also have a calm mood. They are not fierce or evil, or on the contrary, there is more tenderness. And true warriors, like Lu Xun, and many other true intellectuals, because they have to face the bleak life, because they have to face the dripping blood, there are too many pains and depressions, and on the contrary, they have less of that kind of leisure. Hu Lancheng, on the other hand, is that after Zhang Ailing’s engagement letter, as a traitor, she was able to catch up with Xiao Zhou, a nurse who lived on the first floor when the war was defeated and lived alone in Wuhan; when the war had already failed and she was wanted as a traitor, she was anxious. Such as the dog of the bereavement absconding everywhere, once again catching the beauty of a thousand miles away, but the source of life depends on Zhang Ailing's writing. The book is not ashamed, but it reveals glory and contentment. This is something that any responsible and responsible person can do. Under the current circumstances, some people have become traitors, and they are still a generation of heroes, like Wu Sangui, and some people have become traitors, but still just rogue literati, such as Hu Lancheng. "
1	The location of the hotel is not bad, the environment is ok, the room is a bit small. 
0	"I personally feel bad about this hotel: 1. Hardware (1) Some floors of this so-called hotel apartment seem to have guest rooms and some residents. I even saw someone leading a big white dog in the elevator! There is no sign like ""Haiyue Riverside Hotel"" either outside the courtyard or by the door of the building. You can only look for it by following the house number, which feels very unprofessional. (2) The room is facing the street. It is too noisy in the morning. There is no need to wake up or an alarm clock. (3) The bathroom has a glass brick wall facing the street, which is very cold. (4) There are only four options for breakfast, a small amount, and a single order costs 40 yuan per serving! 2. Software (1) The quality of the staff is really poor. When there are three people sitting at the front desk, no one pays any attention to me until I say that I have a room to stay in. The checkout was very slow. I waited for a lot of people, and the invoice was issued in two days into one day. Everything was very unprofessional. "
1	Advantages: cheap, not bad configuration, 8 wrong appearance, can fully meet daily use Summary: cheap, not bad configuration, 8 wrong appearance, can fully meet daily use 
0	The building is very old, the rooms are large, and the service is good. The morning tea on the second floor is good. 
1	The overall look is more beautiful, the efficiency of operation is in imagination. Good performance at this price 
1	I personally think that the book that best reflects the Prince’s intricate thinking like the London Underground Waterway system, wild imagination and unpredictable text! And it's from Relay Publishing House~ The packaging is very careful to say&#183;! I bought a copy last year and gave it to my classmates when I didn't expect it; of course, that copy has been widely circulated by my classmates. . . I bought another copy this year and circulated it in my new class. . . . Thinking about buying a dozen back, hoarding half, borrowing half and giving half and half. . . . . . . . . . . 
1	I live in a business standard, the room is good, very clean, and the service is good! Will live next time. . . 
0	I checked in on November 29th and left the store on December 1st. Since I accidentally forgot my newly bought leather shoes and accessories on an instrument at the hotel, I called them. I am very patient, and I would like to express my thanks! But I don’t know why, the person at the front desk just couldn’t find it. I called the guest room in person after asking for the phone number from the room service center. But the leather shoes and the accessories are separated. I said, then send the accessories back to me. I found the SF Express company to adopt the collect method, but the leather shoes were really not sent back to me. I put these two things in Why are the shoe boxes separated? The impression is that the front desk is good, but the guest room does not work well. 
1	The hotel service is very good, the environment is also very good, but eating in the hotel is too expensive, the corner is very off, the traffic is very inconvenient. 
1	"I bought ""Little House"" because I read the book ""Seeds of Happiness"" by Matsui Nao, Japan. The book gave a high evaluation of the little house. I think the book recommended by the master should be good, so I ordered it from Dangdang.com One, children really like it. At first I told him, and after three times, people started to look at the pictures and tell them, sometimes letting his father be the audience, and sometimes I was the audience. Children like illustrations very much, he can also notice the subtle things in the illustrations, and use his own understanding to explain. I also insisted on taking it to the kindergarten to share this book with the children. I am very happy. This book is worth it! "
0	As a well-known online store in China, how can Dangdang sell books of such quality? The cover of the book has been torn apart, and the delay in contacting and returning the goods is really disappointing. Everyone has learned a lesson from my book purchase, and I have to re-examine Dangdang! ! 
0	I saw that the evaluation on the Internet was better, but I found it to be very impractical when I turned it over. I talked about some major meridians and I couldn’t operate it 
1	When will the price be reduced, the new product is CQ40-514TX 4200/2G/250G/512 alone, the price is lower than 404!!!! 
1	The appearance is pretty good, more beautiful than the photos. Lightweight, good screen, low heat, and the fan rotates every moment and the sound is not loud. The system is installed with the special version of Carrot Home Notebook XP3.0, which supports SATA hard disks, and there is no need to change to compatibility mode. Only the wireless network card is not driven, and the driver disk that comes with the machine is used to solve the problem. In general, this machine is very good value. 
1	The waiter's attitude is good, if there is a meal delivery service, it would be perfect! 
1	Cost-effective, after a brutal burn-in test (72 hours without shutting down BT, during the day after I woke up, I used high-configuration games to continue to destroy), there was no problem 
1	A colleague in the office flipped through this set of books and couldn't restrain the sympathy in his heart. He had to buy a set if he didn't listen to persuasion, and read it with gusto and sighed. Take out a copy when you have time to enjoy it. Really childlike! I can't really enjoy my childhood like her, it's because of psychological deficiency. 
0	No driver CD is configured. This is very bad. Although the notebook itself is burned. But it also troubles customers. 
0	I feel that this book is not very cost-effective! I don’t like it very much, and the child doesn’t like it very much either, it always says no, there is nothing in it 
1	The front desk clerk was very enthusiastic. Due to work, when I left the hotel at 5:00 in the morning, the hotel prepared a morning snack for the guests, which made the guests feel very warm and considerate. 
0	Four-star hotels, I will not mention the places that meet the standards. They have the following shortcomings: 1. The standard room does not provide free bottled water (the bottled water in the bar is 8 yuan a bottle) 2. It is far from the city and cannot be reached Car, and does not provide car-hailing service 3. Other meals are unknown, breakfast is huge, free registration, website navigation, hotel index service description, about Ctrip is looking for talented agents to cooperate 
1	Although it is a popular science book, it is not that simple. You still need to have relevant knowledge to read it. In some places, you have to think about it repeatedly. Although many inferences were given right away, it is not difficult to see between the lines in Hawking's words how vigorous thoughts were when they first appeared. I thought it was an adventure in modern physics, but the more I saw it behind, the more I felt that chemistry, biology, and philosophy and theology were all involved. 
0	I looked at it a little bit, and I started to take it seriously. The more I look at it, the more I think it may be more suitable for married people to read~~~~ Alas, put it aside, I need to read it later... 
1	I bought him a full set of Magic School Bus 1 two years ago, and this set of books became one of his favorite books. I also read Magic School Bus 2 again. I feel that the style is somewhat different from 1, and the amount of information is not as large as 1, but there are more hands-on experiments. The children are very interested in this new part. We are going to prepare after the mid-term exam. Just start experimenting. I plan to buy the Magic School Bus 3 in a while. I have an idea: how to deepen children's interest in a certain field? The magic school bus greatly increases children's interest in scientific exploration, but the amount of information in this book is always limited. 
0	Ha ha. A few simple strokes can express such a rich life. Lovely Naoko, lovely life. Reading her comics, life is so good:) In her book, she became a little girl again:) 
1	"Chen Danyan is one of my favorite female writers. I like her to write real people and their dreamlike lives in a light style. But ""My Mom is an Elf"" is a book chosen by the 9-year-old daughter herself. After the goods arrived, the child said yes and asked me to see that it was to meet the child's request. Unexpectedly, when I got the book, I couldn't put it down and read it all in one go. Great book! The tone is still light, full of true feelings, and the characters in the pen are delicate and full of love. Mental activity is even more successful. It is a good book to teach children to love and understand people! "
0	The hotel traffic is extremely inconvenient. I waited for two hours from Xinhui Bus Station at 4 pm and couldn't wait for the shuttle bus (it is a normal bus station waiting). At the end, I called the hotel attendant and asked us to take the bus to Yanan I took another taxi to Gudou. The cost was about fifteen yuan. After sitting for an hour and a half, I went to Yanan and it was dark. There were no taxis there. The shuttle bus was off work, so I had to call The hotel asked them to help call a taxi. They said that if a hotel car was booked, it would cost 100 yuan, and he would help us to call a taxi for 30 yuan, and he had to wait for more than ten minutes. Gudou spent more than six hours, and the hotel room was worse than I expected. The deluxe mountain view room booked from Ctrip was the most expensive but the worst room I have ever stayed in. Maybe it was a summer vacation room tension. The surrounding facilities are average, but I will definitely not go there again in the future. I would advise you not to go there unless you are traveling in a group or by car. The traffic is really inconvenient. 
0	It takes half an hour to register a house. The whole lobby is like a market! The room layout is extremely poor! 
0	Your company sent it on the 14th, why haven’t you received it today? Today is the 26th. It has been 12 days and I haven't received the book yet. 
0	The hotel's service is simply not good and ranked first! The first day I stayed at 1702, the room leaked. Adjusted to room 1710 the next day! The air conditioner in this room is broken! Woke up in the middle of the night. On the third day, I adjusted to room 1107, which was obviously much smaller than rooms 1702 and 1710, and the room was not able to access the Internet. I was tortured and had no energy to adjust the room. I want to lie in bed and watch TV, my goodness! Can't see it! In short, I am quite satisfied with the service of Ctrip. I am particularly dissatisfied with the room service provided by Xinhu City Hotel in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province! I hope that Ctrip can think about its franchise hotels. How can we trust a brand like Ctrip? Overall I am very depressed! Also very sad! 
1	Fortunately, I caught up with 4699, checked by myself, the packaging has not been opened, the screen is perfect, not bad. The machine is pretty 
1	It's quite light. I modified XP myself, and I can basically find all drivers on the official website. The color is pretty good. Some people say that if you change to XP system, the sound effect will be worse. I didn't think, maybe I didn't realize the excellent performance under VISTA system! But it's enough to watch the film usually. 
0	Japanese hotels are so poorly cooked. The room is very old, I knew it would be better to live in Jinjiang. The breakfast tastes bad, with few varieties. It's so unpalatable. The 528 yuan room I lived in. The price/performance ratio is totally out of the question. I will not choose here again. 
0	"The son is over 2 years old, and this book is a bit difficult for him. I think it is more suitable for children aged 4-5. In general, the picture is a bit ""chaotic"", even adults seem to be struggling. This book is more like a map. For example, the book will introduce a variety of cars with complete names and styles, but the story is not strong and it is a bit boring to read. "
0	When Benben first started, the fan sound was a bit loud, but then it stopped. I don’t know why 
1	The location is good. It’s just that the annex building ordered is different from the main building of the Bailuzhou Hotel. It used to be called Mining Building. Now it is a joint venture with Bailuzhou Hotel. The room is relatively large, but the decoration is relatively old. The door of the room just opened A little musty smell. Fortunately, I only slept there for 5 or 6 hours. The only advantage: It is close to Yuandang Lake, and the air is fresh in the morning. 
1	A good choice to go to Liuzhou. The surrounding area is quite lively, bookstores, pedestrian streets...the service is good, and the rooms are ok. The bathroom is too small, and the breakfast is too average. Anyway, going to Liuzhou is considered OK. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: We have given feedback to the western restaurant about your opinion, and the buffet breakfast variety has been adjusted. I believe it will satisfy you. Liuzhou Hotel is located in the commercial center of Liuzhou. It is very convenient to eat, live, travel, travel, shop and entertain. It is your first choice for business and tourism in Liuzhou! ! 
1	"I heard about An Yiru a long time ago, but only recently did I start to read her writing. Speaking of the title of the book, I still like the phrase ""Moshang flowers bloom slowly"". It has always been difficult for me to read poetry and history. Reading this book gave me a little understanding of these. As for the understanding of poetry, I can't say good or bad because I don't understand it, but I like part of An Yiru's interpretation of poetry and her understanding of characters and history. As for writing, I think except for those poems, it's very average, better than me, and it doesn't show a full-read poetry. "

1	"As soon as I got this book, I couldn't wait to see it because it was Oprah recommended by Zeng Zimo. These two women are people I respect very much. Story reading. Soon after, I thought of this book when I was writing a ""word"" about people, so I turned back and read it again, reading it with insight. I like the part of her in the Indian Dojo the most. The wonderful spiritual process made me feel the urge to go there. Because her western thinking habits are a little different from ours, but in fact she expresses something very profound. This is a book worthy of careful consideration. "
1	At the beginning of the book purchase, I was worried that the content of this set of books was too small and the children would not like it. But after getting the book, she liked it so much, because the cover was somewhat embossed, it felt very comfortable and the quality was great! My daughter is 6 years old. We read a story every night. She listens very carefully, and some of them have to listen to it several times. Especially worth mentioning is the translation of the book, which is well translated and suitable for children to read independently, with vivid words. After reading this set of books, the child has learned a lot of words, such as: reluctant, condescending, gloating and so on. 
0	It’s a bit heavy, the keyboard feels a little bulging, the left and right keys are hard. The screen is a bit dazzling, and the brightness is turned down, and it’s a bit dark. It feels uncomfortable for the eyes after a long time. 
1	"The appearance is very good and delicate, and the battery life is very long. I have been installing software and updating the Internet after I bought it. After more than four hours, the battery still shows more than 30%. In addition, this type of packaging box also contains a ""liner bag"", but it is very thin and simple, just like a thin cloth bag. "
0	The disadvantage is that everyone agrees that the screen is too bright. I lowered the brightness and contrast of the screen through some NVIDIA color settings. I can barely accept love, but compared with the desktop, the color is still a bit different, so it can only be 4 points. , And the viewing angle of the screen is not high. 
1	Very average five-star hotel, the surrounding environment feels messy 
1	I ordered it for JJ. It seems not so good. The water seems to be almost meaningless. Additional comments March 29, 2008: I ordered 3 points, but it still shows 4 points. 
1	At that time, I was going to write a reading report, so I found this book when I copied it everywhere on the Internet. I felt that I hadn't seen the Chinese version of Luo Tuo Xiangzi before and watched the movie, so I decided to buy an English one to see. I thought it was translated in Chinese and it was not too authentic. I was surprised that the translation was very good! Faithful to the original! Many, many complex compound sentences and the words are also very decent. I think it is a very good recommendation for a novel to broaden the knowledge! 
0	I wanted to set up Jinci Hotel, but I was out of rooms. I recommended it to bring the city here. In fact, it is far from Jinci. Service attitude is not good. There are no taxis at all, there are black cars, and it's a terrible cut. 
0	The delivery speed is really too slow. It takes 5 days from order to receipt; and the battery of this notebook is not durable at all. I bought it for less than half a month, and the battery takes less than 2 hours, at least. More than 3 hours is ok. There are also 2 million pixels on the camera, which is actually only 300,000 pixels. 
0	I bought it after reading everyone’s comments, but when I got the book back, the child was not very interested. I was always absent-minded to tell him, wait until he gets older. 
0	1 The hotel is rather inconvenient to take a taxi. 2 There is a KTV upstairs in the hotel, which is very noisy at night, especially for the guests living on the fifth floor. 3 Front desk reception, blunt attitude. Those who book through Ctrip are not welcome. The lady who received me gave me a business card and asked me to book a room and call the hotel directly. It is annoying to say that Ctrip has to send a fax back. That lady seems to have a surname Feng. 4Too much water in the house price The price of the room price is 516 yuan, but the general booking will usually be sold at 318 yuan as long as the price is negotiated. 5The day after I checked in, after I checked out, I had to check in because I had something to do. The front desk heard that it was booked through Ctrip and directly answered that there was no room reservation (the city did not have any major events on that day, and it was not a tourist season) 6 rooms The price inside is much higher than outside. A bottle of mineral water worth one yuan outside is priced at 5 yuan in the room. And there is no shopping place near the hotel. 7The sense of service is too bad. I asked the front desk staff about the local weather forecast and said that I don’t know. 8Breakfast is poor, some dishes are still cold 　 The hotel has good facilities but lacks effective management, poor service awareness, and even a bit of a big shop, although it is not a big shop 
1	The silver touch area is very fashionable, and visually looks smaller. The machine configuration is relatively powerful, enough for personal office 
0	Often staying at Jinglun Hotel, I feel pretty good. But I went there in March and arranged a double bed in the corner of the room. The service staff said that if the deluxe room pays more, we can give it to the double bed. I will consider staying in another hotel when I go to Beijing. 
0	The hotel facilities are outdated. The furniture is old. The TV is small. The bathrobe does not seem to be newly washed, and it is just a single cloth. The door is not soundproof. There is no free instant coffee and tea. When booking, Ctrip said the hotel facilities are four-star Yes, so disappointed! 
0	I saw the evaluation of this book from the Internet today. The content is about Bailong’s boss Sun Yingui maliciously owing the relevant money to the Yanjiao construction site. The process and content of the written complaint by the other party was shocked after reading it. Originally read Boss Sun’s After the <Law of Fairness>, I felt that the content of the book seemed to justify or justify myself (the story of turning against my brother and the story of telling my failure to invest in Chishui). I heard that this incident is both unexpected and reasonable. How can a person who kills one another with his brothers for money, and a person who defaults on workers' payment to vent his anger, can be equated with a person with a sense of social responsibility! As small as his own family, as large as his opponents in society Is his business fair? Sun Yingui is too talented? It, fooling readers who don’t know! Sun Yingui is too rich? It’s a distorted truth of hype! This may be called a kind of fairness for the rich, right? !...(In the response to each book review of Dangdang, there is a detailed introduction about this matter) 
1	Have stayed here many times, every time I come to Zhaoqing, I must stay at this hotel. The facilities are a bit old, but facing Xinghu, the transportation is convenient, and you can feel the blue waves of Xinghu and the cultural atmosphere of Zhaoqing at any time. It feels pretty good. 
0	I have read Yu Dan's book and I want to buy the genuine one on Dangdang. Why don't I have a library ticket? There is no bookmark in the original book, disappointed! 
0	The ACPI in Bios cannot be opened, and the patch cannot be found in the driver CD. Once it is opened, it will blue screen immediately. I originally wanted to add another 2G memory by myself, but there was a no-demolition label affixed to the screw holes on the back, indicating that it would not be guaranteed if it was removed. There is no demeanor of a big factory. EeePc does not have this restriction. 
0	"There is nothing to say about the good air. Fish spa reduces a lot of dead skin. The hot spring is indeed good outdoors (although it is not very deep, people can't stand up), but there are too many places to strengthen the service. First, the breakfast is about to end at 9:30. I arrived at the restaurant at about 9:25. The welcoming guests in the restaurant did not inform in advance. After entering, the breakfast was almost received. I grabbed a large plate of rice noodles from the waiter and basically did not eat To what. Second, there are no safes in the rooms on the second floor. Is this one floor short of it? Third, the waiters in the Chinese restaurant gather in Batai to chat when there is nothing to do. The service is basically self-service. Fourth, the hot spring service is not very good. We went to three people together to do pedicures. While we were waiting for the waiter, one of them ran away because he didn’t know the other person asked him to do pedicures. After the waiter came, he went out to look for him. He didn't know it and said he didn't do it. The waiter ran away. After he came in again to find out, he asked the waiter again. I couldn't invite him. These two helped us to do it After that, they all fled and left. No one can be called anymore. Fourth, the towels in the hot springs must be optimistic. Many unconscious tourists throw their own towels on the ground or get wet, and just take others and put them away. There is a big problem with the towel management of the hot spring. We originally booked two rooms. My room was changed due to temporary incidents. I told Ctrip that I had changed it. Because of the above treatment, my friend had to end the trip early. It seems that there is another one called ""Nanyuan"" nearby, but it seems that I haven't found it on Ctrip. I don't know what will happen to that one? "
0	1. The operating system is ASUS DIY, it's best to replace it with a more popular operating system such as Hongqi, ubuntu, etc. 2. The frame is a bit thick 
0	Now it is different from the previous version. The top cover is now all blue, which is not as good as before, and the logo on the top cover can no longer be illuminated, which is a bit uncomfortable. 
1	It should be the best hotel in Jinan, but the room is not big enough in terms of grade. It is a great pity that there is no own shopping mall! 
0	The hotel is actually an internal guest house of Lanzhou Railway Bureau. It is located at the exit of the railway station. If you are not afraid of noisy trains, you can sleep well at night. The price is not cheap, it can only be average. The room is very old, the equipment in the room is average, the sanitary exhaust fan is broken, and the toilet is broken. The maintenance staff is very temperamental and should be treated politely. The quality of the front desk staff is relatively poor. When I checked out in the morning, the front desk could not find the waiter. I waited for nearly half an hour, wasting precious time. There is a charge for parking at the hotel. It is recommended not to use this hotel as a check-in option unless you have special feelings for trains. 
0	This hotel is quite old, like the hotel 20 years ago, it is really not a good choice of accommodation. The service staff also have no concept of hotel service. (I don't know what to ask) The only advantage is that the pedestrian street is next to it, which is convenient for shopping. The other is not good or bad internal management? With Ctrip booking, no deposit or credit card pre-authorization is required when checking in, and payment is made after checking out. The credit to the guests is very high, which is rare in the hotel industry! 
0	The vista system is not used to it and slow. . . . . . . . . Adding 1G is still slow, there are many fingerprints. . . . . . . . 
0	It is the most unacceptable thing that Wanjie International cannot use the card. The TV in the room cannot be used for a long time, and the Internet charges are even more unacceptable. 
0	The content of the book seems pretty good at first glance, but when I look at it, I find that the whole book basically talks about the same truth. 
0	The pictures of this book are cumbersome and the quality of the translations is average. My kids don’t like to see other people’s English words and phrases. The translations are very adult. 
1	The appearance and workmanship inherited the consistent style of Thinkpad, and it is very practical to use. The 15-inch screen is obviously larger than the 14-inch, and it feels comfortable. Since it is placed in the car, the weight is not a problem. The gift bag is just right. I had a balance of several hundred yuan in my JD account before, plus the discount of the East coupon, I think it is worth the price. 
1	"This book is good, it can cultivate the image of father in the children's mind. My two-year-old baby likes to listen to it. Sometimes I have to tell it four or five times while sleeping. I feel that when speaking, adults should not just follow the text in the book. They can add some of their own things. For example, when I tell my baby ""Dad is not afraid of anything, not even the bad guys, big wild wolves"", I will give them at the same time. She said that ""Dad is brave. If you have a father, you don't have to be afraid of anything. You are not afraid of thunder, firecrackers, and small bugs (because the baby is afraid of these)."" The baby will say ""There is a father, the baby is not afraid"". Very brave. "
1	The stability is very good, the noise is very small to use, the operation is stable, there are few problems, and there is also on-site service 
0	Dizzy, how can I recommend this book to children aged 2-10? I saw the first book, but there are only two concepts: 1. Not going to bed on time! 2. Getting married and having children! 
0	CPU-Z detects the memory frequency and found that it is DDR3 800 memory, which does not match the said 1066. I'm still not used to the 16:9 screen, and I can't play games. The installation of the system is simply disgusting, now the boot also shows an unknown system, it is estimated that LINUX has not been cleaned up 
1	"There is an old version of Wesley's ""Old Cat"" at home. The child likes it very much, and I lent it to classmates. This book was requested by the child, and after buying it, I couldn’t put it down and read it all in one go. After reading ""The Mansion"", I went to the library to lend him some other fantasy novels by Wesley, such as: shipwreck, living figurines, blue blood man, strange man in the ground, monster fire and so on. Wesley’s novels are full of suspense, but some works have a pale ending, such as a shipwreck. Some are too dazzling, such as living figurines, but fantasy is the wings of life. Only when full of fantasy can life not be confined to the present, is it? "
1	I live in a business standard, the room is good, very clean, and the service is good! Will live next time. . . 
0	The pre-installed system is not good. I have to reinstall it when I come back. The memory is a bit small. If it can be equipped with a 2G option, it would be great 
1	There is no breakfast, the hotel price is relatively expensive, and the room equipment is relatively outdated. But a swimming pool is not bad! The Japanese and Brazilian barbecue buffet on the second floor is not bad! 
0	The room is basically a remodeled corridor. It is long and narrow. The windows are small. Outside the windows is a rescue staircase. Next to it is a big iron rescue door. There is no sense of security in living inside. No broadband. There is no refrigerator. There is no pot for boiling water, only a drinking fountain that is not very clean. The bathroom is also very average and looks dirty. The surrounding environment is not very good, unlike the city center. The underground parking lot is small and dark, and there is no good parking lot nearby, which is extremely inconvenient for us traveling by car. It's not like a three-star hotel at all, which is far from what was introduced online. 
0	It's hard to believe that Ctrip will book such a dirty hotel. The faucet and shower in the bathroom are rusty, and the carpet in the room is black. 
1	The author's brushstrokes are very true, and the image of a husband who is unfaithful but loves his wife is unobtrusively shown to readers. What is true love and what is the eternal entanglement of the soul is a question that people who have read this book have to think In this book, we understand the hardship that life is about to die but can do nothing about euthanasia. We no longer believe in bad luck, bad luck does not exist, and luck does not exist. Believe that luck is an insult to life. What a tough human beauty. 
0	I bought one on the 17th and 18th. The inner bag is different. One of the inner bag is really lame. One laptop case has a film, one does not. Don't understand, is Samsung also a copycat? 
1	"This is a good book worth recommending. The concept described in this book is ""live in the present"". In fact, when Master Taixu (Li Shutong) explained the Buddhist classic ""Paroparamita Heart Sutra"", he mentioned that ""everything that works is like dream bubbles, like dew like electricity. , Should be viewed as such"". It's just that ordinary people often feel difficult and difficult to understand when they come into contact with Buddhist scriptures. You can understand them easily through this book. Don't be stuck in the quagmire of time, put aside the past, face the present, and be not afraid of the future. If you don't understand something about this book, personal experience is - refer to the original text. "

0	The price is slightly more expensive, and the configuration is lower than that of the same price machine. Of course, this brand is placed there! Fujitsu! The sound of the speakers is relatively small, and the mid-bass is poor, which is too far from the Altec Lansing speakers such as HP. The weight is considerable and not suitable for taking out. This color is not resistant to dirt, and it will not look good if it is dirty. 
1	Stayed many times, the location is convenient, and there are many places to eat around. The room is a bit small. 
1	My wife and I stayed at the hotel from April 4th to 6th. I am very satisfied with the hotel’s service, environment, and service. The check in and check out speeds are very fast. I arrived at the hotel more than 9 in the morning. At that time, because there is no room available for the time being filled, I first paid a deposit of 3000 (statement, this is just a guarantee with a credit card, and no payment is made, so it feels good), and then you can store your luggage for free, and wait until 2 pm After shopping around, I moved in smoothly and upgraded to the 18th-floor executive room for free. The room is spacious and clean, and all facilities are complete. My wife and I were very satisfied after staying for two days and felt that it was excellent value for money. It only costs 961 Hong Kong dollars a night, which is less than 900 RMB. Living in Hong Kong feels very worthwhile and the transportation is also very convenient. You can go directly to Mong Kok East Station and reach Luohu directly from the stairs. It is very convenient to travel to and from the country. It is the indicated Fa Yuen Street (many sports brands with reasonable prices). If you go to Tsim Sha Tsui, you can walk to Prince Edward MTR station or Mong Kok MTR station in 10 minutes. In addition, the hotel also has fixed-point free buses to Tsim Sha Tsui. I went out in a hurry and didn't have time to feel it. In general, I recommend you to try this hotel when you come to Hong Kong. The price is really proportional to the service you enjoy. 
0	Stayed at this hotel on the night of January 10, 2008, the environment is very good, very quiet. I can’t remember the specific room I live in Woxianlou, it seems to be 3115. Starting at 22 o’clock, I think the room is very noisy. After looking around, I found that my room is separated from the next room by a door, and there is a big underneath. Gap. The noise came from next door. I don't know who is living next door, the music is loud, or disco music. In addition, there seemed to be a lot of laughter from men and women. Unbearable, I called room service. Later, a service staff went to the next door to report the situation, and then the next door converged slightly. But after a while, the situation remained the same. I wanted to rush to argue with it, but when I was single, I endured it. In this way, sleepless night. It directly affected my work status the next day. Here, I strongly protest, and hope that in the future, no discordant people will go to the hotel. 
1	"The ignorant one is the first book that opened my professional contact. There are no deep technical terms and no boring descriptions. It seems to be following a journey and discovering the city. Later, my friend gave me another book ""City Kaleidoscope"" by Mr. Ruan, and I liked it very much. To borrow the words from the book: The city is a treasure box. You can find magical treasures in it. You don't need to dig around with a hoe. It is likely to appear in your daily life space. Please watch it carefully when you pass by. After discovering it, isn’t life just a series of surprising combinations! "

1	The room is clean, good value for money, the price is reasonable, not bad 
0	The man has an extramarital affair, and the woman has a red apricot out of the wall. I can’t stand it after reading the upper half. The author wants to express nothing through this book, but this kind of book can easily convey an attitude of unfaithfulness to marriage, making the world think this is normal and fainted. . What and what. Criticize strongly! This kind of book can also be popular, alas, the value orientation of this era is really problematic. 
1	"I used to tell my daughter the story of Lena the fox stealing fish in fairy tales. She listened attentively and opened her eyes wide. I really hope that the story will not be so exciting and let her go to bed quickly, ha ha. Later I bought this book, and my daughter liked it for a while. When she was telling a story before going to bed, she would talk about ""Lena Fox"". What a smart fox, I love it. Now the daughter is a little older and she doesn't look much at it. However, the happy times brought by this book will never be forgotten. And the happy time that this fox named Lena brought us. "
1	Stayed in a deluxe room at Yunnan Economic Trade Hotel for two days in June. It was off-season. I used the hotel pick-up service and breakfast. The lady who picked up the airport was very happy to introduce Kunming and the surrounding environment of the hotel. Breakfast was very rich. The room was clean. Service Very good. Very close to the city center. 
1	Thank you Mr. Yu Ge for bringing you such a wonderful book! 
1	I am a customer in Wuhan. My son is 9 years old this year, who likes to read books. I came to Dangdang.com through a friend's introduction. I heard from my friends that your products are of good quality and good price. I will give it a try. I have two books, which are really good. I am very happy that you can deliver the books to me in this short time, and the quality of the books is also good. It seems that I will cancel the opportunity to buy books at Xinhua Bookstore in the future. From now on I will be your loyal customer, and I will also introduce you to friends around 
0	It's a big book with few content and few words. For younger children, the format is too big and hard. Older children see too little content 
0	The order placed on the afternoon of April 30 was not delivered by express delivery during May Day, and it was only received today. It was a big loss for the holiday! 
0	I really recommend that all friends who are on business trips to Chengdu do not stay at this hotel. First of all, the location of this hotel is really bad. There is basically no entertainment nearby, and because the nearby taxis belong to the suburbs, the management is not strict. If I find that I’m not a local, I’ll go around a long way. I stayed at this hotel just to stay close to my customers. As a result, the taxi cost me 30 yuan for the 10 yuan journey. The most important thing is that the service of this hotel is very poor, the executive room does not have administrative treatment, and even the free services are counted as money when checking out. And I am an InterContinental Gold member, and I always pay more attention to the accumulation of points and stay days. Because I am a hotel booked by Ctrip, this hotel does not even give me points, and even a standard member’s stay days did not accumulate me. . Similarly, the InterContinental Zongfu Crown Hotel near Chengdu Zongfu Road has very good service and geographical environment, and I clearly told me that although it is a reservation, the Priority Club membership card still points. Here is an explanation. Because I was not satisfied with the first day, I moved there the next day. I sincerely suggest that all friends who have a Priority Club membership card must not stay in this hotel. If you want to live, go to the Crown Palace. Chengdu is very small and the high-tech development zone is not far from the city center. It is also convenient to live in the Palace. . 
1	I bought it for my wife. The overall feeling is noble, all kinds of functions are complete, the heat dissipation is relatively balanced, the interface distribution is reasonable, the color is very beautiful, and the shell and keyboard are all piano painted. 13-inch screen, gold size. 
1	The screen is perfect, but the color is slightly worse. I don't have 3Dmark06 in my hand, and I ran with 01 to score 24761, and SuperPI's 1 million bit calculation score was 27.291 seconds. The sound of the stereo is average, but the volume is sufficient. The keyboard's keystrokes are okay, but the arrow keys are reduced, which makes playing fifa games very uncomfortable. The machine has good heat dissipation, and the temperature of the palm rest will not affect the operation. In addition, this machine has the ASUS LOGO, which is below the B-side display, but the logo is very hot here, I don’t know why. 
1	It's small, it looks good, it's black, and it's very comfortable to use. Exquisite workmanship, complete functions, wireless, bluetooth, camera, suitable for ladies. Better than MSI U100, the touchpad is very textured 
0	We didn't receive the book at all. I don't know what happened. I didn't receive a call. The book is almost one month old. What kind of business is this, I hope the business will contact us as soon as possible to explain the situation. 02800923158 
0	The location is not bad, it is convenient to go everywhere, but the service is not as good as it is managed by Howard Johnson Group. I slept and took a bath in the afternoon. I wanted to let the hotel come to clean again, so I turned on the service light, please clean, but when I returned to the hotel at night, I found that the service light was turned off after cleaning, but the room was still not there. Cleaned. 
0	"Today, I will finish reading the ""Law of Fairness"" exclusively released by Dangdang.com. I am disappointed! Especially when I look back and compare the super nasty preface written by the recommender Wang Hongwei (what does this person do?), it is really disgusting. It is understandable that Sun Yingui who wrote this book is a person who has not graduated from elementary school after all. Although he has made money, he should be regarded as a successful person in the business society. But after all, the writing is not enough and the ability to control the writing is limited. If you can talk to Mr. Sun Chat, it is estimated that they will understand the meaning of what they want to express more clearly. However, writing a book, especially summing up a ""law"" is really incomprehensible, and Xianglin's wife talked about it for a long time. It can be priced at 33 yuan. I can only say ""I take you!"" to friends in the publishing industry. "
0	"I think when I buy a book, I must first consider what effect it can bring to me and whether I can learn what I want to learn. After reading this book, I feel that Lala’s personality is very similar to mine. , The essence is relatively simple, kind, and stubborn, but maybe I am not as hard-working and brave as her, nor as ""hard-hearted"" as she is. I must fight for what I want. I also hate the overly complicated interpersonal struggles in society. My way is generally to choose ""escape"" or ignore it.............Haha! All in all, this book is worth learning for women who want to mix in the workplace, ha ha. "
1	The hotel room is not bad, the big bed is very comfortable. I slept soundly at night, and the hotel environment is less than the four-star standard, but higher than the three-star. The location is good and the price is moderate. 
1	Being strong with knives is in many journals and magazines, and I am also a dog, and seeing knives is even more cordial. After receiving the book, I was a little disappointed. I thought this book had the same format as Absolute Kid, and it was a bit smaller in comparison. But the content is still very exciting! Although many have been read in other magazines, I have read this book several times and read it again. The few words in the painting are so humorous and profound! There are still tears in the smile when I read it! Reading is certain, and I will buy several other books. I recommend this comic! This guy loves knives! 
0	I don’t know how to dissipate heat. Look at the air outlet and air inlet below are very small. It depends on the future use. 
1	The fan sound is not very loud, you can accept that the pre-installed vista was deleted by the company’s network manager and helped me install XP. However, the installation process seems to be very troublesome. It took a long time to say that you have to format and then install the system. It is estimated that people who do not understand computers can not handle other The mouse is very comfortable to use 
0	Maybe men and women in the United States are different from those in China? For a person with rich life experience, many things in this book are not very practical. The only practical advice is: always remember that men and women are two completely different creatures. 
0	The room is like a small roadside hotel in the 80s. On the way to the restaurant on the third floor, sewage flows and black stains can be seen everywhere. The room does not even have a hair dryer! There is no free mineral water and tea bags! On the carpet under the computer desk Black stains are everywhere!! What's even more funny is that sometimes the response you get after calling 51 (front desk) is that you look for 52 (housekeeping department); then 52 says you look for 51!! Generally speaking, it is still the practice of state-owned enterprises. 
0	There are also shortcomings: 1. The weight is not light, don't look at it, it is quite heavy, it feels similar to my THINKPAD; 2. The screen frame design is not good-looking, too wide like a large mold with a small screen; 3. The beautiful paint loves to stay Fingerprints are a dilemma between aesthetics and practicality; 4. The bottom temperature is not low, and it is hotter in summer when it is placed on the leg. 
0	The operating system is the DOS version! No other problems have been discovered yet. The original gift package is in the box, please indicate it! 
0	The room faces the street, the soundproofing is poor, and the construction outside makes it very noisy! The room door lock seems to be malfunctioning, the green light is displayed when the door card is inserted, but it just can’t be opened. Since I only booked one day with Ctrip, I had to add another day if I had something to do. The front desk was uncomfortable, and I always asked when to check out the next day. Hotel feedback May 20, 2008: Hello, the hotel sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience caused to your stay! The hotel has improved and tracked the problem you mentioned, and will do its best to reduce the impact You have a small problem with your stay in itinerary. Please continue to give us your trust and support! We have negotiated the construction issues around the hotel, and the night construction will be effectively controlled. We will definitely use the sincere service concept of Homeinn to provide you with better service. 
1	After I got this book, I was a little worried at first. This book is quite small, and the pictures are only black and white. The style of prints, I am worried that the child does not like it. But after showing it to the child, the child likes it very much. Let me repeat it , I didn’t expect it. Until now, I haven’t figured out why children like it. Maybe it’s the plot of the story, maybe it’s related to cats, maybe the kid has seen too much of the big picture and colorful picture books have caused aesthetic fatigue, but this one is different. It is like an appetizing pickle. Anyway, I firmly believe that children are appreciative. 
0	Breakfast is better than nothing! This is the long-distance bus station. You can imagine what the outside environment looks like! The people living here are more like transit passengers. I have seen nuns and monks! The room facilities are better than the guest house. Older hotels have fashionable names, but the hotels are really not comparable. There is a Milan club, probably a happy place, and a sauna and massage place. I don't need to say anything about it. Everyone knows what it is. The room phone rang at 10 o'clock every night. It's up to you to recruit or not. Let's weigh it up by yourself. 
1	When I got the book, I immediately opened it and took a look at what was inside, and found that the few books I gave were very useful! There are 10 sets of test papers, and each set of answers follows. This is a bit different from the materials I bought before, which is also good. One thing is strange, that is, there is only one sample answer sheet, and there are no answer sheets for other test papers. Fortunately, I don't really need that thing, so for me, I don't care about it. I flipped through the answer, and I felt that the writing was very detailed and it was really good! My classmates and I bought this and hope it will be of great help to our exams! 
0	The hotel is average, the only thing is that it is close to the airport and there is a free shuttle bus, so there is no special impression. 
1	First-class workmanship, beautiful appearance, great graphics card, Altlanstar brand speakers, metal texture at the hand drag, and a complete variety of interfaces 
0	The sound insulation effect is very, very, very poor. Sleeping in the room is like sleeping on the side of the road, and the sound on the road is clearly heard. I still read the reviews of the hotel on Ctrip and booked a room above the 5th floor based on the opinions of netizens. The result was still very noisy, and I couldn't sleep at 12 o'clock in the evening, so I had to turn on the TV to cover up the sound of cars on the road. I don't know when I fell asleep. I was awakened by the sound of a car early in the morning. I looked at the watch and it was only 4 in the morning! It was only 4 o'clock, which means that even if I fell asleep at 12 o'clock in the evening, I only slept for 4 hours. I have a headache. I have to work during the day. I close my eyes and sleep hard. I can’t fall asleep anyway. It’s too noisy. I can't stand it until 5:30. I called the front desk and asked if there is a quieter room to change. Now I can't change it at night. I answered: No. Stare at the ceiling until 6:30 and get up. After filling 3 cups of coffee in the breakfast room, check out immediately. I was going to live for three days, but I couldn't stand the noise. I really don't understand how such a poor condition has a 4.0 rating on Ctrip. Another: 1. The TV broadcast is too complicated and inconvenient 2. The waiter has a weak sense of service and has no sense of being considerate of customers and problem-solving. This is reflected in breakfast coupons, invoices, etc. 3. The network cable is too short, about 20 cm long, so you can’t access the Internet on the bed. 4. The power connection is not good. When the computer power is connected to the socket, sparks crackling. At that time, I thought: The computer is damaged because of power problems. I don’t know if the hotel will pay for it or not. I have a question again: How can there be a high score of 4 or 0 in such a hotel? Feedback from the hotel on March 30, 2008: First of all, thank you for your stay and give your valuable comments. We apologize for the environmental problems in the room that affect your rest. For some of your questions, we will rectify as appropriate. In addition, the hotel breakfast is used with the room card, and there is no breakfast voucher; our guest room center always prepares a longer network cable for some guests with special requirements, if necessary, only one The phone will be delivered to the room immediately. Thank you very much for your valuable comments and sincerely look forward to your visit again and give us an opportunity to provide you with better service. 
1	The workmanship is excellent. Under the premise of maintaining the high-performance configuration, the heat dissipation of the machine is very smooth, and the temperature of the whole machine has been around 30 ° after one day of starting! 
0	Booked a room, the insurance chain was broken, and no one came for a long time, so I repaired it myself! The facilities inside look a bit old! It is said that it is about to be renovated into Hanting, and the house price will rise accordingly 
0	After coming down from the bus station, I ran into a few hotels soliciting guests, chattering endlessly, so I booked this hotel through Ctrip. Qufu is not big, the hotel is located at Beiguan of Qufu City, about 1 km from the station, and then took a tricycle. 4Quick money is cheaper than expected. The hotel feels like a guest house in the town in the 80s. The lobby is dark, there is a lot of garbage in the aisle, no one cleans it, the carpet in the room is dark, and the room is small. The toilet is also dark. . . . I also asked the front desk clerk if there is a direct bus from Qufu to Shanghai, but they were told they didn’t know. As a result, I had to book a plane from Jinan back to Shanghai. When I went to the station to take a bus to Jinan the next morning, I asked the conductor that there are several buses from Qufu to Shanghai, especially there are many Jining and other places between 1 and 3 in the afternoon. The passing car to Shanghai passed by. . . But the ticket was booked, so I had to return to Jinan and then fly back. There is a Qufu International Youth Hostel more than 100 meters away from the hotel. It looks good and should be quite clean. The price of a family room is only RMB 120, which is cheaper than Yulong. I suggest you go here next time. Additional comments May 2, 2008: Where can I get fruits? ? ? It is estimated to be changed this year. 
0	I don’t know if I am too good at English, but there are indeed some omissions. On the first few pages of the book, there is a sentence that seems to be wrong. 
1	This is a book that I personally think is very practical, but the content is somewhat simple, but it revisits the self-help knowledge I learned in school. With age and a comfortable social environment, the consciousness of self-help is getting weaker and weaker. Until the 5.12 Sichuan earthquake, human beings were so small and fragile in nature that we could not resist, but if we have some knowledge and ability to save ourselves, we can help ourselves and others within our own ability. Now people are too dependent and have given up the ability to help themselves. Although the content of this book is simple, it makes people notice that waiting is worse than saving oneself. 
1	The price is cheap and the configuration is higher. The best thing is that the hard disk drives are divided and the drives are saved. It can be used after installing an xp, which is very convenient. 
1	Not bad. Very convenient, you can get the information from the National Library. The battery life is very long, more than 6 hours. 
1	"The book that my son and I have read N times in the past few days. At first I didn’t feel this book was interesting. After reading it, my son (first grade) asked me to read it to him N times, and then read it myself. The story is read every day. Books for 1.9 yuan! Never thought I would read it so many times. My son likes Tommy Badger sleeping on the bed so much that the fox needs to hang a bucket on his bed. Not happy every time. The son wanted to buy the story of Peter Rabbit again, so I searched Dangdang.com and couldn't buy it. Fortunately, there is a copy of ""50 Children's Classics That Move Children"", so buy one. "
1	I have always liked Xiao Hei, and finally got his wish this time. 4399 bought such a configuration and brand, which is very good value! The machine is very beautiful, the appearance is very stable, the keyboard is very good, much clearer than my previous Asus, the screen is perfect, self-detected, there should be no broken points or anything! Little Red Riding Hood is not used to it yet, but it is said to be great! 
1	Overall it feels good, but the windows of the room don't feel very useful, the breakfast is average, but it is still worth living! 
1	It is best to read the three books together. Tibetan Mastiff 2 is mainly about the thrilling fight between Tibetan Mastiff and wolf. The scene is very grand, spectacular, and the plot is very attractive. In the plot of Tibetan mastiff saving people, there are many touching deeds that make people cry. I really yearn for the Tibetan mastiff on the ancient grassland of Xijie, brave, clever, and loyal. It is always the first person before the self, and sacrifice yourself fearlessly. Especially the big black mastiff that day was really moving and admiring. There are many Tibetan mastiffs who have sacrificed themselves for humanity. The noble Tibetan mastiffs are the spirits given to mankind by nature. 
1	Every time I go to Taiyuan, I live in this hotel. . . As far as the level of Taiyuan City is concerned, it is good; however, compared with other cities horizontally, the price-performance ratio of this price is obviously insufficient. 
1	The TV is too small, the subtitles are not clear, and the service staff is still very good. MM at the front desk attitude is very good 
1	The price is cheap, the quality is good, the screen is good, enough for me. Don’t pursue high configuration when buying things, this book is very good to use 
1	After reading Xiao Wu's book, I feel that it is very close to life. The theory and practice are combined, and it is easy to realize the true meaning of educating children. It makes people feel very emotional and feel that China's education system makes us parents do not know how to understand children and how to better help children grow up. Inertial thinking is the biggest problem we encounter when educating children. This problem not only prevents us from helping children grow better, but also becomes the biggest obstacle to their growth. What a shame! Thank you Xiao Wu for giving us the opportunity to re-examine ourselves. 
1	The hotel is relatively clean and the service is not bad. Parking is also more convenient 
1	"Personally, I think this book is the most worth seeing in the ""Carp"" series so far. Everyone is jealous, jealous of what others have but not themselves: family love, friendship. . Every word in the book seems to be talking about yourself. It is very appropriate. Envy is a bay of black water. Most people control the water within a range that can hold you. If the black water overflows, it will pollute the surrounding area. , And will completely cover this bay. Destroy others, but also destroy yourself. This may be the inevitable result of excessive jealousy. "
0	The bed is large, but the room is close to the street, and the street lamp shines into the room through the glass in the bathroom, affecting sleep. The air conditioner is installed directly above the desk, blowing towards the head, and cannot work. 
0	The system is more difficult to install, especially if you want to install xp, you must have a system disk with a SATA serial driver to install it, otherwise it will not install, and it will be depressing! Finally, VISTA is installed, but fortunately, there is no large-scale commercial software demand. 
1	The location is very good, just at the corner of West Street, but it is quiet and the environment is fresh and elegant. It's just that the front desk is too narrow. The receptionist is always busy. The guests are all standing in a row. Everyone doesn't line up. Whoever calls it can be handled first. Both check-in and check-out procedures took more than half an hour. The hotel room is relatively clean, without central air conditioning, manual air conditioning, ha ha. The hotel is better than the environment and location. 
1	The author combined some of the views of Hill, Carnegie, Wang Zhongqiu and other masters, combined with the actual situation in China, and pointed out a practical way for young people who aspire to success. I have also read many books on success. Only the author of this book is an entrepreneur. I feel that he said it more truthfully. In fact, we don’t expect success if we have to compare ourselves with Bill Gats, we can realize our little dream. . If Hill et al.'s work is the general outline of martial arts, and you still need to study it, then this book is the secret of martial arts, you just need to follow it, and as for Jackie Chan, it depends on how well you practice. 
0	Regarding this check-in situation, I don’t want to spend too much space on this comment. I just briefly talk about the situation. I hope that Ctrip will encounter such a situation in the future, and it will start a quick response mechanism to avoid delays in the itinerary. Because it is a night flight, I am I arrived at the hotel at two o'clock in the morning. I was exhausted and came to the hotel at the scheduled time. It took ten minutes to call at the front desk before someone came out from behind, and I still couldn't sleep. After I gave my name, she said I couldn't find out that I was a room reserved by Ctrip, but then I said there was a room, so I checked in as soon as possible. After staying for two days, when I checked out, it was 80 yuan more than the 198 room I booked. The explanation was that there was no 198 at the time, so I gave me this room type. The room type I lived in was called a business double room, which was only about 5 square meters! I asked if there is any smaller than this? The answer is yes, right away Fainted!~~~~~~~~ The final result of the coordination is that I waited for two and a half hours and called Ctrip six or seven calls before it was resolved.The problem was resolved, but it was quite unpleasant. 
0	1. The hotel room is small, the standard room I live in is very small and very comfortable; 2. This hotel is a three-star hotel, and I think it can get two stars at most, which is a better guest house; 3. The price is expensive and the surrounding environment Not good; 4. The service quality of the waiter is extremely inferior. It is recommended that the association ban the membership of the hotel. I feel fooled. 
0	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I mean management. 1 The front desk was not familiar with the location of the hotel. A taxi from Ningbo asked him if he was in Xinqi District. He heard the sound of turning over the paper while listening to the phone. It was probably a map, sweat. . . 2 Ask if there is a non-smoking room, answer, there are ashtrays in the room, generally do not smoke, but the guests can not control it. gosh! Need training on the concept of non-smoking rooms? 3 There is phone consumption during the hotel checkout, I said it is impossible, I always use mobile phones. The front desk repeatedly said it would certainly not be mistaken. I checked the time, and it suddenly occurred to me that during that time, when I entered the room, I saw an electrician repairing the room's lights (I didn't apply for repairs). I asked them to check the records, and finally found out that it was the mobile phone of the front office manager, and the hotel itself used the guest's room phone to call the mobile phone, and it was really unheard of to blame the guest. 4 Let the hotel specialize in separate washing and dry cleaning during laundry, fools all know that dry cleaning must be dirty. It turned out to be unwashed when delivered. After questioning, I said re-washing, which delayed my wearing. Don't say anything. I will check out the next day and let the hotel where I will be staying to see me off. But no one knew about it when checking out. If I hadn't asked a lot of thoughts, I'm afraid my clothes would fall into the sea. It was agreed that it was delivered, but it was not delivered after the time passed. Later, I called to urge it and finally delivered it, but I was even more disappointed that it was still not cleaned, and it was strange that there were spots of oil stains in the originally clean place. , I really don’t know if I am doing laundry or wearing clothes. Seriously doubt the origin of the outsourcing laundry of the hotel. 5 Electricians did not greet the guests when repairing the lights, and there was no second person present in the guest room. After the repair, the wall dust was all on the quilt and no one cleaned it. 6 Ctrip took the room close to the nearby nightclub, and did not rest until twelve o'clock in the evening. After the complaint, he did not say that he could change rooms. All in all, the impression of this hotel is very bad. Hotel Feedback November 9, 2007: First of all, the hotel expresses its deep apologies to the guests, and thank you for your comments. The hotel has strengthened its staff training so that each employee has a stronger sense of service. We will carefully absorb the opinions and criticisms of our guests, and we will change them if we don't, and we will be crowned if we don't. I hope that all guests are the supervisors of our hotel, and let us do better under your supervision. Thank you!

1	Beautiful appearance, white and suitable for girls. The stuff given is quite sufficient, first of all I saw a 250G hard drive. Better than HP's, it is too stingy to give 8G hard drives even solid state drives. This kind of book is similar to everyone, and it is worth buying an affordable one.

0	There are no or very few non-smoking rooms! Smoking is not allowed inside the elevator, but some smokers still do not obey the rules! I am a non-smoker, a victim of second-hand smoke! (Out of China's 1.3 billion population, there are only 320 million smokers. Less than 1/4!!!) Please see the smoker of this comment, feel okay? Thank you. 
0	I bought this book by accident. I bought it after reading a wonderful review. I was disappointed! Maybe it’s my age. This book should only be suitable for teenagers and twenties. It's boring to come. 
0	Fortunately, I only bought one copy and only wasted a few yuan. I think Chinese people have always liked to look at some things in a swarm, without their own subjective judgments. This book, how ridiculous, what is the difference between Carmela, no Did you lay the eggs too? It's so humble to lay eggs again. This is called self-inflict. If you teach your children in this way and let them take detours, will it be different? 
1	I bought it during an event and it was worth it. High cost performance and reliable quality. It is a very cost-effective notebook in the entry level

0	"I have bought two sets of ""Different Carmela"", because not only children love to watch it, but adults also love it. The childishness in it can awaken the most innocent side in everyone's heart. The pictures are exquisite and the language is especially suitable for children to read. My eldest nephew likes this set of books. So this year, I bought another set for my friends’ children, hoping they can grow up healthy. "
0	"Women, especially girls, are thoughtful, sensitive and romantic, and they are more likely to be far-sighted and thoughtful. This book is to let women know how to be down-to-earth, don't be over-minded, and don't think that love is all about a happy life. Generally speaking, it is not bad, but I prefer ""What is the Happiness of Women"", which is more in line with the reality of Chinese women. "
0	The front desk service attitude is like a night lady face...The room is small, the bathroom smells of fuel consumption, and people feel like vomiting... Originally stayed for 4 days, stayed for one day and ran away... 
1	My wife and I stayed at the hotel from April 4th to 6th. I am very satisfied with the hotel’s service, environment, and service. The check in and check out speeds are very fast. I arrived at the hotel more than 9 in the morning. At that time, because there is no room available for the time being filled, I first paid a deposit of 3000 (statement, this is just a guarantee with a credit card, and no payment is made, so it feels good), and then you can store your luggage for free, and wait until 2 pm After shopping around, I moved in smoothly and upgraded to the 18th-floor executive room for free. The room is spacious and clean, and all facilities are complete. My wife and I were very satisfied after staying for two days and felt that it was excellent value for money. It only costs 961 Hong Kong dollars a night, which is less than 900 RMB. Living in Hong Kong feels very worthwhile and the transportation is also very convenient. You can go directly to Mong Kok East Station and reach Luohu directly from the stairs. It is very convenient to travel to and from the country. It is the indicated Fa Yuen Street (many sports brands with reasonable prices). If you go to Tsim Sha Tsui, you can walk to Prince Edward MTR station or Mong Kok MTR station in 10 minutes. In addition, the hotel also has fixed-point free buses to Tsim Sha Tsui. I went out in a hurry and didn't have time to feel it. In general, I recommend you to try this hotel when you come to Hong Kong. The price is really proportional to the service you enjoy. 
1	"The moment I got the book, my first impression was very beautiful. It not only attracted the attention of children, but we, as parents of children, had to say that it was a well-made book. Let’s talk about the content of the book. Take a look at the content overview. The new ""Prince's Revenge"", a classic story, a completely different interpretation, and a gripping plot. As a fairy tale novel, it makes sense to score five stars. what. I also scored five stars on behalf of my children. New writers can write such stories. Such writing skills are indeed rare. Continue to work hard. I believe that the author will become a generation of children's stories. "

Poor service: When I entered the room, I found that the sheets and bedding were simply laid on the bed without being flattened at all. The corridors, aisles, and the grounds behind the building are full of tables and chairs, and cluttered clutter (you can see the basic level of hotel management and service). Poor dining: when checking in, the reception desk recommended dining in a hotel (plus 17087105 praise), ""decisively"" decided not to find another hotel. When ordering, I felt wrong. The orderer didn’t know the three or four fish in the fish tank, and he was a hundred ""sorry"" about the cooking method of the dishes on the menu. The dishes on the table are even worse (58 yuan a fish head casserole is half a pot of soup and a bunch of fish head loose bones...). It doesn't count if you have to buy a separate ticket for breakfast, the quality is really not flattering. (17087105: My good friend, your comment is really important for us to stay in the place, you can take us a little bit!) Poor hygiene: This is the most terrible point, on the way after leaving the hotel, The two ladies (sister and wife) in the car showed unsightly movements, one scratching his arm desperately, and the other scratching the back of the instep. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that the two white and tender skins had small red spots, one At first I thought it was a mosquito bite, but I was immediately denied by the brother-in-law who had a little medical knowledge. Qingshan Lake is really not the Qingshan Lake it was a few years ago. The original beauty has been replaced by dusty and muddy real estate development sites. It is chilling to see Tianqi Hotel, which I have stayed in for several years and is quite satisfied, now the door is closed, people go to the building, windows and doors are broken, rusty, and depressed. It's not surprising to look back at a resort hotel with more than 400 yuan to enjoy such a resort. Every time I stay in a hotel, I like to give priority to praise and comment. But this time, with all due respect, and without extreme words, such a hotel is a shame to Ctrip! Additional comment May 9, 2007: In the past 5 or 6 days, the little red dots on my wife’s feet have not disappeared. A few days ago, it was very itchy. It can be seen that the little red dots are very poisonous. I regretted my death when I stayed in this hotel. Up! "
1	Sorry again, I mean the first comment has a typo, dizzy 
0	I find that I don't like it very much and the content is very small. Although the decoration is very good, but I won't buy it next time, it is better to watch Doraemon! 
0	"When I checked in for the first time, I felt that the room was too old, the bathroom was too small, and the water was hot and cold while taking a bath. The large trucks outside were noisy at night, and where the sound of the construction site was the same. Huh..."" Except for a green mountain on the other side, breakfast is okay, nothing good! Hotel Feedback March 27, 2008: Thank you for staying at the Master Hotel. Our hotel is currently undergoing water heater replacement. The site problem is the construction of the Shenzhen Metro. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you! Thank you for your comment! "
0	Why is the screen super bright and depressed every time I turn on the computer, it cannot be partitioned, and the boot speed is slow, and VISTA is not easy to use? 
1	The white piano paint is very beautiful and the sound effect is great. For surfing the Internet, doing some text office, watching movies, as long as it is not a super blockbuster, the key is the convenience. 
1	Others have all the advantages, good heat dissipation, perfect screen, atmospheric appearance and high delivery efficiency! ! ! ! 
1	Beautiful appearance, matte keyboard feels comfortable, configuration is not bad, beautiful appearance, matte keyboard feels comfortable, configuration is not bad 
0	I stayed for one night on December 16, 2006. I had seen ctrip's residents comment area until it was noisy. I specifically asked for a room on the 8th floor that was not on the street. The result was still too noisy. Moreover, the soundproofing of the room is very poor, and even a little bit of outdoor movement can be heard clearly. Secondly, the running water from the faucet is really small. Even though the central air conditioner is turned on at 30 degrees, it still won’t be cold in the shower. Just rinse it off. 
0	The content is general, and relevant reminders can be obtained on websites and other channels. . . The paper is okay, the characters are big, it's too wasteful 
0	A bit heavy, it feels heavier than Thinkpad T400. It is not possible to make a mirror disk of the factory, but HP says that it can apply for one. 
1	The price is cheaper than Zhongguancun. The battery capacity is really good. It takes about 6 hours to watch a movie. I like the appearance. I personally think it looks better than NC10. The screen color is good. 
0	The keyboard is not too user-friendly. When the goods arrived, I felt that the logo was scratched. I originally planned to change it. Later I found that the surface film was removed and it was intact. It was not scratched. It weighs a little 2.4KG. If you drive to get off work or occasionally It doesn't matter if you go to work with your back on your back, I feel acceptable. 
0	This hotel is an office building renovation. Whether it is the overall decoration, room facilities, and service standards, it is far from a 4-star hotel. What is strange is that such a poor hotel is actually very well received??? Please keep your eyes open, please Don't stay in this hotel. 
0	The special room has no external windows; the sound insulation of the room and the room is too poor 
1	I took it back and reinstalled XP. The driver was installed smoothly and the heat dissipation was good. The noise was very small and there were no bright spots. I was very satisfied with this book. 
1	Used to connect to the TV with the same resolution. The price is above average. The wireless network card has a manual switch, which is user-friendly and solid in design. 
1	I plan to read it a few more times, take notes, and start implementing it once I'm working. 
0	When registering at the front desk at the scheduled time, the service staff told us: XC did not make a reservation, and later made multiple calls... In addition, the reservation price and the retail price are only 4 yuan difference... 
1	Very good location, living in a deluxe sea view room, you can see the trestle bridge and sea view by opening the window. I remember that I lived a long time ago, but it has been renovated now. Generally satisfied, will live in the future 
0	It is easy to understand the situation in the workplace, and it is easy to resonate. The ways and skills to deal with problems are worth learning, and the story is touching. 
0	I booked it after seeing the online ratings, and I was disappointed after I went. I went to check-in at night, but the hotel did not turn on the lights. We ran around Zhengyi Road three times and couldn't find it, so we had to call them to come out. Get the place. The card cannot be prepaid, so we have to check the room rate and renew the room card every day. The room is broken, the wallpaper is taped, and eight of the ten sockets cannot be used. Find a pillow and quilt The cabinet is stuffed up, it is probably very dirty, and there are psychological barriers to use. It is difficult to open the closet if you want to hang clothes. The door lock is difficult to close, and the door is closed very loudly every time. Broadband is basically a display, and it is necessary to find someone to repair it. It is said that the IT person is resting and fainted~~ The sanitation in the room is extremely sloppy. Our two rooms smelled of medicine for a few days, and the window could not go away; one smelled of smoke, but could not open the window at all. It was even under the head of the bed. There is an egg, and there are items left by a guest in the drawer. The most exaggerated is the bathroom. There is no compartment for the shower. The whole bathroom is full of water. After the shower, you have to lay a large towel on the floor every day. In order to be able to go in. I don’t want to talk about that breakfast at all. The serving time is 7-9 o'clock, things are rubbish. Later I don’t even want their breakfast coupons. The receptionist at the front desk is considered polite, but the check out is very slow Later, I learned that the people in the house must go and check the room before they can be closed for us. I just want to say that I will not ask for the things in the house, and I am afraid that people will take it. It is too exaggerated... Wan would never go there again, so disappointed!!!!!! 
0	One word, bad, two words, especially bad, three words, especially bad. Such a four-star hotel? Please don't recommend Ctrip to us for a rebate. 
1	I made a reservation for a friend. It was the first time he went to Hong Kong. His evaluation was: it seems a bit smaller than the average standard room, the soundproofing of the room is not very good, and the service is not bad. The transportation is very convenient. There is a subway downstairs, but the price of 961 yuan seems to be a bit high. Next time I go to a place where I would rather live again, the price is cheap. Anyway, it takes only 10 minutes to take the subway to live far away. 
1	I don’t have to say about the price/performance ratio, the price is very good, the workmanship is good, after all, it is ASUS, the heat dissipation is okay, but I haven't played large games for a long time, just a preliminary impression. The screen is a perfect screen. 
1	After several comparisons between the accommodation in Baoding and other hotels, I found that the Bank of China Tower should be the best hotel in Baoding. Anyway, for me, I only need to go to Baoding, now this is my base. Better than the so-called five-star hotel Xiulan Hotel. 
0	Three Star? Exaggerated, really exaggerated! Poor environment, poor room, bed! worse! ! ! service? Shaking his head, only shaking his head! 
1	Not bad, but it is more difficult to find, because Changning Road is too long. If you take a taxi, the driver is usually not found, wasting a lot of time. 
1	Maybe it was built earlier, and it feels like the interior is not very prominent. 
1	No doubt about the grade, the word is magnificent. The room facilities are slightly outdated and the service is first-rate. It should be reminded that as soon as you get off the airport bus, beware of over-enthusiastic black taxis that will crash you into the car, which may have serious consequences. Additional comments on March 20, 2008: The breakfast buffet is so rich. 
1	The price/performance ratio is very good, dual-core, discrete graphics card, LED screen 3999, the price is nothing to say, heat dissipation is okay, I run Warcraft for half an hour, a little left hand support, it should be a bit hot in the hard disk, but not hot. . I usually turn the fan for half a minute 
0	I saw that it was written with a 6-cell battery, but the one I received was a 3-cell battery. Later, I confirmed it with a 3-cell battery. 
0	The screen is not installed properly, I don't know why, the left side is close to the edge of the screen, and the right side is 3 mm empty! The battery is not very useful, after all, it is 3-cell. 
0	I checked in on March 6th. I checked the reviews of other hotels from netizens at that time. They were not very good. I chose this hotel because there were no reviews yet. But it turned out to be very bad, not four stars at all, there were cockroaches in the closet in the room, and I shot one dead on the spot. 298 yuan/night is definitely not worth it. Compared with Chengdu, the price is the same. The service and equipment are too far apart. I won't live there next time. If possible, it is best to go back to Chengdu to live. The Mianyang-Chengdu drive only takes 1 hour and 45 minutes. 
1	Stayed overnight from Lushan and took a taxi to the long-distance station to go to Huangshan the next day. It's next to the railway station, if you take a train, it's near. But it is a little bit away from the bustling area. The accommodation does not include breakfast, 5 yuan per person. There is no train noise, as if there are no cars coming into the station at night. The hot water for the bath is good, the temperature is quite hot, and it is always there. The fast food restaurant next to the station tastes terrible, so don't eat it. 
1	"I have always known the importance of Guoxue before, and I have read many books, but since I started to read this book, I have deeply felt that Guoxue is actually so powerful! I am now in my sophomore year, and most of the materials I have read on Chinese studies before are for exams, but this one is very interesting. Indeed, many of the principles in the book are actually so ""simple"", but to do it, we must start with every day, every action, and every thought! A person is truly powerful, I think a large part of it is these inner qualities! I saw it and gave it to my classmates! Really, worth having! "
1	The price is really high, and there is no breakfast provided. Is the price Ctrip got bad? Or do you keep it unwilling to let our customers? Get the price at the front desk, 430 will do. 
1	Before buying a book, I was afraid that I would not lose my appetite for food after reading the book. As a result, I felt like I wanted to read it all at once. I like the layout of the book. It looks very comfortable. I will not feel depressed when facing reality.. The author said that the handcraft workshops were demonized by additives into mass production. I really feel sad. I doubt what is left of the current Chinese time-honored brands.. The current situation of food in Japan is like this. What about China? A very practical book. After reading it, I really benefited a lot. From then on, the ingredient list on the back of the food packaging bag is no longer a display for those who don’t know it. At least I will pay more attention... 
0	From my perspective, it looks a bit ugly. There is a problem with 720P HD under the Vista system, and the picture flickers. There is no Bluetooth. If you switch to an XP system, it might be no problem. 
1	"But what I do want to point out is that I am very thrilled with the term ""uncle""... "
1	The hotel is in a good location, about 25 minutes walk from Tianfu Square and Chunxi Road, 5 minutes by taxi. The room and service are also good, enough for Samsung. It's just that the breakfast is too simple. The carpet and wallpaper in the room are a bit old. 
0	Stayed in General Standard, the bed is small, the overall facilities of the room feel like a guest house, there is still a smell of feet left by the previous tenants in the room. Never live again. But the service of the front desk lady is remarkable! 
1	I came across a hotel doing activities and added 40 yuan to upgrade to an executive room. The rooms are not bad and relatively new. The waiters are trainees, unskilled but serious. The front desk attitude is also good. But the room is in some condition. In the middle of the night, I had no choice but to request a room change, and later agreed. The overall feeling is pretty good. The location of the hotel is also good, it would be perfect if the price is cheaper. 
1	I used X60 before. I only like Xiao Hei. Very light, almost no noise, even the sound of hard disk spinning is almost inaudible. Configure the mainstream, tested with related software, the cpu temperature is only 39 in such hot weather today. The workmanship is very delicate, and the appearance is not said, which makes people feel like they can't put it down. It is indeed a rare notebook. 
1	AMD dual-core CPU, 250G hard drive, and camera, economical. USB distribution is also reasonable. You can install XP, not bad 
0	This is the second stay, I feel that the service is not as warm as last year. There was a big smell of smoke in the room. Air freshener was sprayed twice. The windows were opened for two days. The air conditioner and exhaust fan were also ventilated for two days. As a result, the smell of smoke was still great before leaving. The clothes are full of smoke. Hope the hotel can check it and see what is going on. The room facilities are relatively average, and the towels and bath towels obviously look very old. A circle of stains appeared on the edge of the wash basin in the bathroom, which made people look uncomfortable. The soundproofing of the room is not good. Additional comments April 1, 2008: Take a taxi from here to the airport and take the third ring road. It took 25 minutes (without traffic jams) and cost 68 yuan. 
0	The random description does not match the actual situation. The system CD is a blank piece of paper, there is no useful CD, only a word software. A very useful handwriting input software mentioned in the introduction is not available, and an online download address is required 
1	The fly in the ointment is that the quality of the books and editing is significantly lower than that of the previous Xiaowu books! It doesn't look so comfortable and beautiful anymore. It is estimated that many Chinese parents cannot fully accept many of Xiao Wu's views, but after all, they can bring another perspective for their children's education, which is still very beneficial. The other is feeling that living in a small and medium-sized city, there are too few choices for enlightenment education for children. It is impossible to find a wide variety of enlightenment schools that are truly suitable for children like Beijing. I regret that I hope that personality education can be popularized throughout the motherland soon! 
0	It hasn't been used for a long time, because Lenovo has too many softwares, many but not specialized. No other shortcomings have been found. 
0	As a 4-star hotel, it does not meet the requirements at all. The room facilities are outdated and simple, and the service attitude is like a state-owned enterprise. The food in the restaurant is unpalatable and expensive. The most unbearable is Internet charges, and the speed is not fast. Ctrip's housing prices are also scary. Will never stay at this hotel next time 
0	I chose cash on delivery, but told me that I can't deliver it to my door. I am in Baoan Fuyong, Shenzhen, which belongs to the town, so why can't it be delivered? Dangdang should think of a way. This is the first time I have ordered a book. If so, it will only drive customers away. 
0	Depressed!!! Annoyed!! I don’t understand that optical fiber is actually slower than Shanghai Jinjiang Inn's Internet speed. If you want a faster Internet speed at night, don’t go to this place!!! Because the Internet is about optical fiber network, I went to its home As a result, it takes a long time to log on QQ, and the internet speed is like crawling. I made an appointment with a foreign friend to go online, but the card was not working. Even friends in Shanghai said that I heard nothing. I shared a rental in Dalian. I went to the hotel because I was afraid that chatting with foreign friends at night would affect the tenant’s rest, but I didn’t get the money. I called the front desk and said that the computer department was off work. Let the electrician take a look, and then let me I went to the next room to try it, and the result was the same slow. Shouldn't the hotel serve 24 hours? 
1	Reading Mr. Nan's book is like walking in the fog and suddenly seeing a light in front of you pulling you far away, making your heart feel refreshed. There is so much we want to know about life and the world. Things, this set of books will give us a lot of enlightenment, and I believe everyone will get something after reading it. Although many of the contents of this set of books have been read on the Internet, I am still very eager to buy a set of my own collection, and then take it out at any time to read carefully. I personally feel that buying this set of books is really worth it, and I can touch it in the vast sea of books. I really feel lucky to be here! The only small regret is that the words are a bit small! 
1	Mute, the speaker effect is okay, 512M is alone, the T4200 CPU at this price is not bad, students and ordinary practitioners use enough, as long as it is not a feverish audiovisual or excessive requirements for the appearance of the keyboard, it is enough. The price/performance ratio is very high in low- and medium-priced computers. The one disadvantage is that the keyboard is not very satisfactory. If you are used to ThinkPad, you are especially uncomfortable. Those who do not use Notebooks may not care too much. Ok. 
1	Beautiful appearance and practical configuration. Although it is troublesome to install XP system, it is easy to use VISTA directly because it is not playing games. 
1	"I bought this book together with ""Thinking"". I read the book after reading ""Thinking"". It feels that the plot of this book is more complicated than ""Thinking"". It is also just right. The heroine is crazy to pursue the hero and the hero uses his own The legs changed back to the heroine’s life and she always loved her. Knowing that the heroine pretended to amnesia to avenge his father’s murder, but the hero still loved it for her desperately. Finally, the heroine gave up hatred and stayed with the hero. Worth reading "
1	The rooms are well decorated and the breakfast is good. Easy access. recommend. 
1	The appearance is thick and heavy, which has the feeling of IBM's early days. I personally feel that the appearance is unisex and very calm. The performance is very good. Configuration is real. The most important thing is the affordable price. Generally, it is no problem to use the Internet. The shipment was very fast. It was shipped at 12 yesterday and arrived at 8 this morning. The courier and my Jingdong account manager have served well. 
1	My Beijing friend dropped a camera cable, but the person has already arrived in Jinhua and called the hotel. The service staff is very dedicated and responsible. After finding it, we will express it to Beijing. Thank you here! 
0	This hotel is the worst in the hotel I stayed in. It was renovated in the middle of the night. I called the front desk and said that he didn’t hear him. I don’t know if he was deaf or stupid, so the noisy telephony sound was not heard. I went up. I have stayed in a guest house under 5 stars, and I haven't seen a decoration at three o'clock in the middle of the night. Don't be fooled, please support! 
1	In a quiet place in the middle of noisy, you can see nice scenery in front of the window. Hotel prices are indeed a bit high 
1	Order number 2 is placed and number 4 is used. The keyboard feels great! The heat dissipation is also ideal! The camera is okay! The processor is not bad! The appearance is dark, a little chic! The text Linux system, after re-f2, changed sata and installed the xp system, it took a little effort, and then installed a bunch of small programs with its own disk. The battery is not bad. If you have any questions, just call 4007002000 customer service number! The sound card driver is best downloaded and installed on the official website, otherwise it may not be able to record! 
0	Without the operating system, 2G of memory is fine, and the heat dissipation is not good. The left half of the keyboard area, as well as the left half of the palm rest and touchpad, are relatively hot. 
0	Originally wanted to buy a unique display machine, but unfortunately this is not a unique display machine, if it is, it would be even better. But I don't play games, and I usually have enough work and entertainment. 
1	It’s very small. I’m very happy to send it to my wife. Also, I ordered the U100 and the product returned looks like U100X. The built-in Linux system and Bluetooth. But I haven’t tested it after installing XP 
0	This should be the worst hotel I have ever encountered since booking with Ctrip, and it was still 4 stars. The reasons are as follows: 1. The rooms provided by the hotel are adjacent to the window, and there is an overpass below. Although it is on the 10th floor, it is still very noisy, especially when commuting to get off work, it is like living in a food market. 2. There is no way to adjust the shower head in the shower room. You must be ready to enjoy a cold bath while standing in the shower room. 3. Sometimes the door will make a nervous alarm sound. It is estimated that the alarm is not connected properly, and it can’t be repaired. . 4. The elevator is too slow. 5. There are a lot of young ladies in the hotel, and they rush around all day and night, which is incredible. 6. Needless to say, parking is needed. You have to get a ticket to the front desk to stamp. Sometimes I forgot. I finally drove out to the door, and found that there was no stamp. The security asked you to pay the parking fee for everything. Also, when you come back from get off work, don’t encounter commuting. Otherwise, you will have to compete with cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians and even animals for every inch of the road (I really don’t know under the overpass How could there be such a traffic situation, just like a county town in China 10 years ago) 6, and gifts are tricky. Ctrip stated that there is a gift, which is actually a bottle of water. We just checked into the hotel, and the front desk manager of the hotel (known later) called and told us that most of the coke and oranges in the hotel refrigerator are free. Thinking of Ctrip's description, it's not bad. How can I tell us to spend 30 yuan after the checkout, because we consumed the drinks in the refrigerator. Later, the manager at the front desk said that he would only give a bottle of coke and orange. Think about it, I’m staying with two people, and I’m only allowed to drink one bottle. What kind of shit rule is this! A bottle of 10 yuan, let alone a free bottle, you can earn 3 bottles. I don’t know if Ctrip has participated, but the hotel insists on paying the bill and we are very uncomfortable. How can a star-rated hotel do this? When a customer disputes a hotel, the hotel has always taken the initiative to give in, cut it! Additional comments October 19, 2007: Seeing the following review, I immediately checked the credit card bill, and it turned out that the pre-authorization has not been cancelled, my goodness, 2400, even if it is frozen, it is really terrible! 
1	Good service attitude, room sound insulation is a bit poor, breakfast is too bad 
0	The fever is relatively large, so it is estimated that the independent display is driven too much, and many are not useful. For example, using the camera as a camera and DV are pure nonsense. . . 
1	Quasi-four-star has been officially listed as four-star, the rooms are very large and clean, and the service is good. The hotel is right next to the train station and the transportation is very convenient. Moreover, large shopping malls such as Dashang are not far away, and shopping is very convenient. It is also because it is next to the train station that the hotel entrance looks messy 
1	Although it took a lot of effort to install the system, it feels good to use, fast, good heat dissipation, perfect screen and good color display. 
1	1. Beautiful appearance, stable performance, good heat dissipation, gold-letter sign with thinkpad 2. Because of low performance requirements, so choose a single-core book, personal use is enough, 3799 starting, high cost performance 3. Thinkpad's Guangzhou city The service at the after-sales point of East Road is good, because the screws of the memory cover are too difficult to unscrew, go to the after-sales place to install them, the maintenance staff are very enthusiastic and feel good 
1	"I watched it early in the morning, but I still want to finish it. Knowing that all her books will be bought today. Some lives are still perfect only in imagination, but I like such a small life, small fun, and a touch of joy and helplessness. As Miki said, ""Some books don't have to be so significant."" When I browsed the Air couple's website, I felt so cute when I saw ""Grumpy/Eat or not***"" Imagine going to Gulangyu Island one day to take a seat. that is it. And hopefully, their lives continue like this. "
1	Since I have bought the first volume of the warm heart picture book before, the baby likes it very much. I have told every story countless times, and I am still very interested. So after I bought the second series, she didn’t talk to her more, so she took a look at these books by herself, and told me that the LOGO above was the same; hehe, every time I bought a book, I wish I could listen to them all at once. story. I have to talk about the conditions every time. If you want to keep a good book and read it slowly, I will only talk about one or two today, and start after making a choice. Otherwise, I always listen to one and want to listen to one. I really like it... .. 
1	"After studying a lot of spirituality courses, after opening this book, many vague concepts suddenly became clear. I now have the seeds of joy in my heart, not because of others, everything is born by me. I also feel that my savvy has suddenly increased to a new height. Thank you Sister Defen, thank you the publishing house, wow, there are so many people who want to thank you, haha, now I actually use ""rascal"" moves. Thank you for all kindness. . . . . . . "
0	The pre-installed VISTA is uncomfortable! Can't install XP? Changing the system is exhausting, especially the sound card driver is very difficult to install in the winxp system! 
1	The paper of this book is very good, the illustrations are rich in color, and the matching text looks simple on the surface, and the inner detail and taste are quite reasonable. It is very relaxing to take a look after work. Although it is written about the aspirations of the children's world, of course, each of us has come from the children's world. This book seems to bring ourselves back to the romantic and naive but naive and ridiculous memories of childhood. Haha, read it well and keep it well. It is also a good parent-child interaction to watch it with your child in the future. What a wonderful thing to maintain innocence and innocence. 
1	Lightweight, good speed, strong battery life, 8 hours of normal use is no problem. The keyboard is big enough, it feels good when large characters, and the included software functions are very good. Various functions are available. 
0	This book can be used as an example, to inspire dreams, say goodbye to the monotonous life over and over again, find the journey of self, and then discover the beauty of life and the tranquil inner world. It is a book that brings energy, I like it! 
1	"It is a good book. It has some research on the author of the history of martial arts. It mentions a lot of relatively infrequent materials. It is recommended for martial arts enthusiasts. As for pure martial arts literature lovers, it is not recommended. Like the Xiongtai who shouted injustice in front, the title clearly reads ""The Historical Truth of Martial Arts"", and ""Jin Yong's Novels"" are just the attribute of ""Martial Arts"", just an introduction, an entry point. Since you don't like historical truth, naturally you shouldn't buy it. If you can browse through it in a physical bookstore, you won't make such a joke. "
0	I am not very influenced by others, nor did I buy this book when it was the hottest. In fact, I didn’t know about this book. Before Dangdang recently encountered it, I only bought it because it had so many comments. Got it. I regret it after reading it. There is no substantive content, personal little feelings, not typical, nor classic, and his company is not a cutting-edge company,,,, don’t know how others read, comment,, didn’t buy, don’t buy No matter, of course, I don’t know how Dangdang’s recommendation is. 
0	Delivery is super slow~ Still called express delivery? ! ! It has been 9 days, but it hasn't arrived yet, even if it is only delivered on working days, 7 days have passed. What are you doing~! 
1	(JD’s service is okay, but JD’s supporting logistics is really terrible. Generally, the electronic products you want to send will not arrive at you until the 7-day warranty period!) Brand goods, long time, other Nothing. Now ordinary books also have these functions. The same model on other websites only costs about 2000. I don't know if it is a licensed product or most comrades have been ruthlessly fooled! I can only be speechless, only admit my fate! 
0	The quality of the disc is not good, and the screen keeps flashing, which is particularly bad for children's eyes, so after I bought it, I kept it there and didn't look at it. I think Dangdang should sell good quality discs. . 
1	The environment of the hotel is very good, but because of the surrounding roads, the traffic in and out of the city is quite severe. The facilities in the room are good, but the maintenance of individual details needs to be improved. 
1	Very light. It is similar to my x61, but the display area is much larger. Except the font is slightly smaller, it is very suitable for processing files. The camera works well 
1	Indeed as the title. Bowl. Maybe, there is no possibility. At first sight, I bought the title without hesitation. After I bought it, I said to myself, it’s better to be yourself and move towards feeling. So I bought it right. Like it very much and enjoy it very much. Sometimes it may be different from the author's feelings, but it must admire the author's thoroughness. In many cases, love may be a thousand Hamlet and a thousand readers. It’s just love. In many cases, it is destined to be fate that cannot be wrapped in paper... 
1	Very good hotel, friendly staff, new hotel facilities, comfortable living, worthy of four stars. It is especially recommended that the catering is very good, whether it is dine-in or delivery, it tastes good and the price is not expensive. I will live in his house when I go to Xi'an. Additional comments August 10, 2008: write one more point: very cost-effective. Ctrip's price is very advantageous. 
1	Not everyone has a beautiful environment when they grow up to guide you on a healthy and mature mental journey. Perhaps the shadows left by some ups and downs in your heart have not passed by with time, and you cannot get rid of it yourself. Struggling to seek help from the outside world but not getting the essentials. One day, one day, one year, one month, I accidentally turned to a book, that familiar scene, those words on the window paper that have broken my heart for many years, and I am grateful to browse through the pages of puzzles. Grateful heart, thank destiny, thank you, let me have the courage to be myself... 
0	The room is very small, the bathroom smells bad, the appearance of the hotel is outdated, I will not live in the future 
0	Not worth the price. The decoration is average. Outside the hotel is a barbecue street. The breakfast is very simple and there is nothing to eat. Never choose it next time. Refused to even apply for late check-out 
1	"I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. I didn't expect it to be so exquisite. ASUS praises it for quality! ! The key point is to install the system. I recommend everyone to learn from the ""Yifan"" forum. It is 100% successful and extremely fast. As for the drive can be copied from the CD to the USB flash drive... It’s the first time I buy something on JD. Too satisfied. . . "
0	This hotel is disappointing again. I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and I felt very disappointed at the time. I stayed again in April this year and it was even more disappointing, the room furniture was more shabby, the buffet breakfast, the Chinese food was hard to swallow, and I stayed for a total of 4 In the evening, there were two power outages in the same night. It was dark, as if even the fire emergency light was gone. At that time, I was really worried for the people in the elevator, but the hotel did not give any explanation or apology. Obviously, I have to charge for the video on demand fee, and I have to fight with them. The result is that the lady at the front desk sneered at me as if I ordered something but didn’t admit it. In my opinion, your broken TV, the screen is not as good as my laptop. The screen is big, is it worth my on-demand video! Fortunately, the fee was cancelled in the end, but it was wronged by them, which is very uncomfortable. Alas...I have been in many hotels, and the people in this hotel impressed me ........ The hotel feedback May 1, 2008: First of all, I apologize for the power outage. The power outage was an emergency. The hotel activated the backup power supply within 5 minutes, but only provided emergency elevators and emergency services. Lights, switch the power supply to other circuits to resume power supply after an hour. There is no two power outages as the guests said. The video on demand is automatically charged by the computer. After watching the video for more than 180 seconds, the computer will automatically charge the fee. The computer displays the time and amount of the video on demand. But the guest refused to admit it. Later, the lobby manager waived the fee. The guest used a piece of chocolate in the MINI bar, and then bought back the same piece from the outside. During the rounds, the waiter found that because it was not the food provided by the hotel, For the safety of the next guest, this food cannot be used, the guest is required to pay, and the guest refuses to pay. 
0	It took more than 30 minutes to check in, and the service attitude was not good, the location is not too good, not recommended! 
0	Very depressed: the system is very difficult to install, it cost 50RMB for others to install, after-sales service installation requires 240RMB + genuine XP! Then the machine crashed countless times (distressed) + 2 blue screens; the most annoying thing was that the package was opened, and it was full of dirty handprints! The noise is relatively loud, the heat is dissipated, and the hard disk makes noise! 
1	The graphics card is not bad~ the screen is also ok, and there is no rival at this price for playing games. 
1	1. The configuration is sufficient to meet my needs; 2. The screen is perfect and the appearance of the whole machine is good; 3. The heat is OK, but it is not said serious; 4. The sound effect is OK; 5. The keyboard is comfortable; 6. The machine is installed after XP All of the CD-ROMs have drivers. It seems that there is no lack of drivers. When XP is installed, it is very smooth under the guidance of customer service. It is installed by IDE. I don't know if it is slow. I didn't feel it anyway 
1	Generally speaking, it is good, except that the bed is smaller and bigger, the others are good, newly renovated, and the service is good! 
0	A practical book, but some methods take a long time to prove, the explanation of the medicine is too little, and it is better to say it in detail according to the acupoints.Many readers have no previous experience in this area. 
1	"I hope the author will publish more series, such as ""How do dinosaurs wear clothes?"" ""How did dinosaurs go to kindergarten?"" ""How did the dinosaurs go out?"" ""...... in order to give the children more suggestions. "
0	Meridians do not exist, no matter you look at it with a microscope or X-ray, you can't see it. Meridians and acupoints are things that the ancient Chinese imagined when they couldn't fully understand the human body. This pseudo-scientific book is still on sale. I advise everyone to think twice. 
0	The hard drive broke after 4 or 5 days. I wanted to replace it with a new one. Jingdong said that it would send the whole machine back to Beijing. It was too much trouble, so I had to replace a hard drive at a local repair center in Tianjin. 
1	After reading this book carefully, I feel that the author is really a wise mother! Parents’ love for their children is not much different, but the quality is quite different. I have read a sentence before, saying that in the future, children's competition is actually the current level of education competition between parents. Although I am still a mother-to-be, I am glad that I saw such a good book earlier. After reading it, combined with the bold but very scientific parenting concepts in the book, I think about my growing up experience and I feel that I have benefited a lot. I believe that when raising children in the future, I will try my best to carve this beautiful jade with high-quality love! 
0	Can't find the base? Can't be expanded. Originally, I bought the X200 of the general screen, and it can't be used with this widescreen. 
0	The hard disk has only one C zone. Why, and when downloading the update, it said that Lenovo was changing the way of software update and could not update it. I don’t understand. 
0	The screen was a little disappointed and dizzy after a long time. The weight is still heavier. The fan is really loud in the dead of night, and Samsung’s comments say it is quiet. 
1	The lobby environment of the hotel has improved compared to before, possibly because of the arrangement of flowers. The facilities in the room are clean, fresh and comfortable. 
1	The price is really nothing to say, my colleagues are envious, it is also the main reason I buy. The keyboard is so beautiful, so beautiful and dazzling. 
1	Staying in Dalian Fulihua East Building, newly renovated, better condition than West Building, I will choose again in the future! 
0	The battery standby time is too short. After the machine is used for a while, the body becomes hot. It is perfect to give it to the mouse. 
0	I saw this book when I was visiting a bookstore by chance. At that time, I just thought the cover was very nice. I flipped through the content and it was not bad. I waited for a long time and finally waited until Dangdang arrived. But after I bought it and read it, I found out that it actually made sense. Not big, the content is a bit hollow and not very practical. Somewhat disappointed 
1	Reading her articles, you can see people’s thoughts fermented at every moment. The people in them are graceful, selfish, contemptuous, or cowardly, all different, but at the end of the essay, people always feel sigh Surprisingly ending, this is the impermanence of human affairs, is it also the creation of life? Seeing that ancient woman’s ignorance and cares, I sighed and sorrowed; Seeing that feelings are like falling flowers and spring, I am gratified and gratified; Seeing the sadness and separation of destiny, I have no choice but to think. The diverse feelings make me unable to one Time to read this book, one by one, and there is always something to learn. 
0	The built-in battery has a small capacity. It is more troublesome to install the system, fortunately there are easy-drive cables and recorders that have been idle for a long time. 
1	The configuration is not low, the price is not high, the look is not ugly, and the system is not kind. I bought it for my sister. I don’t know the specifics. VISTA will be used first, and then XP will be changed. 
1	Very good hotel. There is nothing to fault. 
0	"①It's too heavy. But considering the long standby time, I can't bear it. ②The keyboard was only the next day, and the ""I"" key fell off. I took a closer look, and the plastic pieces inside. Thinking about this problem, Finding JD.com also had to rely on me to fix it. I glued it with 502 myself. "
1	I watched Du Lala episodes and I recently watched John Ding's hard work; frankly, for me, who has 5-6 years of work experience, Du Lala is more enjoyable, and John Ding is more maneuverable. As stated in the book, there are not too many strict boundaries between private enterprises and foreign companies. In fact, people who can really take a good career path can be flexible wherever they go. The ability to learn is also increasingly important, regardless of age and type of occupation. Halfway through, it feels very beneficial. There are so many artificial emotional dramas, but a lot more realistic versions of the five flavors. Just halfway through, the excitement continues. 
0	I stayed for one night during the Spring Festival, and entering the door was like arriving at a big market. It was almost 12:00 in the evening, and there was still a lot of people, and it felt very noisy. After entering the room, it felt okay, but the bathroom was very poor, and the shower had no door. One room of water. The overall feeling is 3 star standard. I changed to Shangri-La on the second day. I will never go again! 
1	When I first read the first chapter, I thought that the author’s writing was good, nothing more. But later I found out that this book did not disappoint me. It always made people pleasantly surprised. When writing about the uncle, the fourth uncle, and the father, the emotion was natural. Exposed between the lines, the perception of life and life naturally shuttles between paragraphs. After reading this book, readers have also witnessed the hard work of these parents. Just like the author wrote, they finally understood their parents at a certain moment. In their lives, all the hard work and hard work, all the misfortunes and warmth, were originally for the life and life of firewood, rice, oil and salt, birth, old age, and death. 
0	1. There is no paper towel in the whole room. 2. There is no exhaust fan in the toilet. I don’t know if someone complained before that the exhaust fan was noisy and people couldn’t sleep and then removed it. 3. The water boiler was not clean and it was dark. There is limescale, even wherever the water comes out. 4 The footrest plastic in the shower room is super dirty and dark enough to scare people to death. 5 There is no air-conditioning in the elevator, and there is no air-conditioning when entering the elevator on such a hot day. Would you like to think about the comfort of the stew inside? 6 A friend of mine said that walking up the hallway of the guest room upstairs seems to have entered a sauna, which shows how ugly the hallway is. 7 I ran out of paper in the room (here refers to the paper for writing things, like some friends often travel on business, it is inevitable to use paper to write things) The waiter does not put paper in the room. 8 The charge for the New International Exhibition Center is 12 yuan, but no one knows where the hotel is when it comes out at the exhibition. Someone knows where the hotel is in Jinjiang Inn. The hotel is hard to find in an alley. One thing is good, there is a small shop at the door. The traffic is okay. There is not much place to eat around, there is a western restaurant. Foreigners say it is not delicious. The hotel itself has Chinese food. I haven't tried it before. The room is clean. The breakfast is terrible, and it costs 20 yuan less. The service at the front desk of the hotel is so-so. A woman asks her what she will ignore and advises female friends not to stay. Will never stay in this hotel again. 
1	Good price-performance ratio, fast delivery, and delivery will be delivered the next day after placing the order. After a simple test, the screen is a perfect screen, looks pretty, and performance is not bad. After registering on Acer's official website, the warranty period can be extended. 
1	"There has always been such an idea. Although fantasy novels have now been heated up, it must be said that Cai Jun is still an indispensable general in the vanguard. ""Mystery Novel"" has Cai Jun joined by a group of young and promising writers. Why don’t we wait and see for more and better works? What attracted me most this time was the news of the book soliciting manuscripts from readers. If we can't bear it, maybe we should let go and start writing. We really need more Cai Jun so that the river of inspiration will never dry up. "
0	I stayed at this hotel on October 4th. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The service is not good and the hotel facilities are very old. It is said that breakfast is available from 7 am to 9:30 in the morning, but we are more than 8 When I went downstairs, I said that there was only noodles. The waiter was like eating and not eating. It was inconvenient to go anywhere. The nearest subway station had to walk 15 to 20 minutes. We were on the three o’clock in the afternoon. For hours, the general service desk said that it would add half a day’s room rate. The four-stars I stayed in before were not so harsh, and the room did not match the pictures posted online. I don’t know if it’s because Ctrip’s membership price is cheaper. Bad room, in short, I will never stay in this shop again. 
1	The environment in the hotel is good. I have to walk around in the morning and then go for breakfast. There are a lot of people checking in, the parking lot is full, and the service is also good. Generally speaking, it is good, but I did not book the hotel through Ctrip. You can enjoy the extra discount provided by the hotel when you check in. Ask the lady at the reception desk. They say that there is no such thing. If you have any questions, please go to Ctrip and ask, sweat! Calls to Ctrip are always unavailable, only forget it! 
0	Obviously I bought 6 books, but only got 3, and I didn't say what the reason was. How can I believe it in the future? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
1	hotel room 
1	Lightweight, convenient, just plug it into the bag, the battery is durable, I bought the LINUX version, and it took more than 100 to ask ASUS people to install the XP version, which is very convenient to use 
1	thinkpad is so cheap, really good, very stable, cost-effective, good heat dissipation, super affordable 
1	The experience and process of several major practitioners in Tibet described in the book is shocking. I deeply feel that studying Buddhism is a matter of being a man, and an extraordinary master can do it. The experience records of female practitioners in the book are also very rare. I am grateful to the authors of this book for their dedication, which not only benefits foreign yogis but also female practitioners. The second half of the theory explained by Nanshi is very simple and easy to understand. In short, the Fa-rectification is unpleasant and audible, and it is the blessing of those who have the destiny to go deep into this book. Even people who have not yet practiced can glimpse many cosmic rules and the truth of life, and know that daily life can be said to be a little wisdom. 
0	There are often 4 people sitting at the counter. Whether it is check-in or check-out, several people will go through the procedures. Very puzzled! Not to mention the inefficiency, they will actually throw your credit card aside and do other things. Whether you show anger, eagerness or helplessness, the waiter is totally indifferent. There is a comment in front that the bathroom is small. In fact, it is not only small, and the design is not reasonable, the bath water will flow to the entire bathroom. The picture is seriously inconsistent with the actual situation of the room. The apartment has only one kettle. Very inconvenient. 
0	The machine heats up after a long time, and the power adapter is also very hot after 1-2 hours, and the hard disk partition is not user-friendly 
0	No shortcomings have been found yet! It is not very convenient to install the system, it is best to use winpe, the drive disk can also be copied to the local computer and then installed, otherwise there will always be errors if the optical drive is not good 
0	"I don’t know if it’s a driver problem. I bought it and said it was only 66 units. After I bought it, the slogan ""66 units only"" disappeared and I was fooled! ! ! "
1	The location of the hotel is a bit off, but it is worthy of the former Shangri-La, the hardware and services are still good, the crib provided is great, but the Internet broadband is charged, which is not in line with the international trend 
1	Reading Wang Xiaobo's novels, many times will be amused by his language. After the laughter, many thoughts about real life were triggered. Suddenly, I realized that many ideas are surprisingly similar to each other, but since I was a child, I have been repeatedly warned that I shouldn’t think so. Therefore, I bury many real thoughts deeply in my heart, and only when I am alone do I remember Secretly. From the eyes of an ordinary person, Wang Xiaobo uses very rational thinking and humorous language to tell the facts of life and restore the real life. I like it very much. Each article deserves a good taste. 
1	It is much better than MSI U100: 1. The keyboard is a popular protruding design; 2. The touchpad is very textured; 3. The battery design is ingenious, the integrated industrial level is strong, and the capacity is large! 
0	The management of this hotel is really wrong! Booked 1 night through Ctrip on 10.22. When you want to renew the room, you say the room is full?!! Without any advance notice, people rent the room to others before they leave? ! 
0	"First of all, I am very grateful for the benefits that ""seeking a doctor is worse than seeking self"" for me, my family and friends around me. In the increasingly fast-paced life, everyone forgets that they are a life, a life that can be violated at any time. I think my friends who have read this book must be suddenly enlightened. It turns out that we are so despising our health. So I suggest friends to read this book, I believe it will bring you the same big gains as mine. It is this book that made me understand that having a body without trouble is the basis for all dreams. Health is with you and me, ""seeking a doctor is worse than seeking yourself"" with health "
1	This is the second set of 3-4 year old stickers I bought for my daughter. My daughter likes stickers very much. I posted one in almost a day, and three in three or four days. Seeing that my daughter was very interested, I bought another set. It's really a good set of sticker books, two or three-year-old children are more suitable for this set of stickers. 
0	The environment is too noisy, there is karaoke at night, which affects sleep, and the service staff is poor. 
1	Generally speaking, it is ok. I have lived many times. The main attraction is that I can make long distance or local calls for 3 hours a day. The TV is broken and I hope it can be replaced. 
0	The bottom will become hot after a long time, but it is acceptable. The keyboard and hand rests generate very little heat, which is much better than Apple's mbp. The screen effect is very good, but unfortunately it is not 1024*600, which is a pity. 
0	I would like to ask how the HD3200 graphics card when I use perfect decoding to play 1080P WMV, the CPU occupancy rate is above 90% and it will freeze? Hardware decoding has been turned on. . . 
1	Hewlett-Packard's things are exquisite in workmanship. This business notebook looks calm and stylish, and is very good. The configuration is relatively reasonable, the startup and running speed are good, the heat dissipation is also good, the screen ratio feels a bit too wide, you may not be used to seeing more desktop computers. The price is reasonable, if you can upgrade to 2G memory is the best. 
1	The best hotel I stayed in Shanghai for a few days, both are four-star, the overall feeling is the most high-quality, the reservation desk gave the 2715 corner room, very comfortable, my son was very happy, but the hotel The attitude of the service staff is relatively indifferent, and there is still a difference between the treatment of domestic and foreign guests. The same stopped the taxi, and the doorman actually said to me, please let our guest. I look back and see that it is a pair of foreigners living in this hotel. Not a guest? I let it out of courtesy, but I feel very uncomfortable. I hope that Ctrip's price can be lower. 
1	The price is very good, 4199 yuan is worth it! I saw other people’s comments saying: The fever is a bit big. I used it for a long time, but the air outlet on the left side of the notebook was hot, but the other places were not hot. 
0	Full keyboard, keyboard membrane is not easy to find, hehe heat is quite strong; others are still trying. The camera should be 2 million pixels. This cost is not high 
0	This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room card was wrong when I checked in. It was obvious that the room rate of only 440 (I won't mention the price, it is not worth it), and the deposit was 3 times. I did the pre-authorization and then said that I didn't do it at the checkout, and asked me to pay the cash. Later I turned out the bill and said I didn't see it. The checkout took 20 minutes, and I was the only one in the checkout. Asking for an invoice says that there are only integers (the same as the restaurant, but no machine) and not a small amount. In the end, I reluctantly gave some more rooms (not what I wanted). The room was even more useless. There was no internet. The lady's phone rang every half an hour and didn't let you sleep at all (later I unplugged the phone line) and the heating burned. It is 29 degrees, and it cannot be adjusted. It is still hot when the window is opened at -22 degrees outside. I really can't figure out how Ctrip can recommend such a hotel, there are actually many hotels in Manzhouli. I am a diamond member of Ctrip, but next time I go to Manzhouli, I will never book a Ctrip hotel again! Don't live! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
0	The memory installed in the machine is two 1G 667MHZ memory sticks. It affects future upgrades. The VISTA system uses 7OOM memory when it is turned on. After running some software, the amount of memory used has almost reached 1G. 
0	Some things don’t agree with, a shortcut after the fact, but in this case, what young people should experience is still to experience, otherwise they will abandon it after possessing it, because it was not his own choice, so this book is said to be misleading 
1	The configuration is balanced and cost-effective; the appearance is stable and generous; the keyboard design is very good, and the ergonomics is reflected; the heat dissipation is very good, at least much better than Dell (of course, Dell's notebook is junk-grade) 
0	The hotel environment is very poor, it is a small hotel, even inferior to the average small hotel. Since the hotel opened in 1996, it has not had a four-star certificate issued by the Tourism Bureau. However, it charges a room rate of 480 yuan per room, which is simply cheating consumers. I hope that in the future, reservations on the Internet will have a star certificate issued by the National Tourism Administration, and do not bully more consumers of this type of hotel and affect the reputation of your website. I am quite dissatisfied and angry with this reservation. Hotel Feedback September 5, 2007: Thank you very much for staying at our hotel and giving your valuable comments. Now I will reply to your comments as follows: Our hotel has been approved by Tianjin Tourism Bureau and Price Bureau that our hotel charges various types according to four-star standards Cost, so our hotel did not bully consumers. The decoration of our hotel belongs to the humanized style of European and American boutique hotels. The room has a full set of imported furniture and facilities. In the decoration, we try to make the guests feel relaxed and warm. In addition to being able to rest comfortably, it also provides a quiet and conducive living environment for business guests, which is different from the large hotels with hundreds of rooms, which are crowded, bustling, and even lacking a warm feeling. Thanks again for your valuable comments. 
0	Dangdang’s delivery was really slow. It took 8 days from the time the order was placed to the receipt. It was still courier, and I made at least 10 calls to the courier. It took a few days before I arrived in the city. First of all, it was raining. , I kept saying that no one tried to arrange. I bought more than 20 books, and there is a set of 12 books, each for a few dollars, but I sent a wrong copy, and one copy was repeated and the other was not published. I called Dangdang and said that if I want to change it, I need to send the whole set to the post office They will then help me exchange the goods, but I really don't want to be so troublesome, and have to wait another 10 days. This transaction exposed a lot of Dangdang problems. In short, this transaction is not pleasant. 
0	Quite expensive, but very disappointed. The utilization rate is too low. Maybe my kids are also older. None of us have any interest in this book 
1	The biggest advantage of a standard business hotel is its good location. The rooms are clean and the facilities are fine, but some details need to be improved. The floor attendant was very nice (the last time I lived on the 6th floor, I would like to praise this attendant here), tidy up the room, do the cleaning very promptly and seriously, I forgot something when I left, chased me for a long distance and told me. Recently, there is a road construction on Pudong Avenue, and the annex is like a job site. 
0	1. SATA problem, after going crazy. Think that the hard disk mode should be changed to IDE-Native before installing XP. This way, the black screen will not appear. I also installed XP in AHCI mode, but the screen is always black when installing the driver. 
1	This hotel may have a three-star to four-star standard in coastal cities, but in a small city like Jiuquan, it is also very good. Of course, the price is not cheap. The hotel facilities are relatively new and the rooms are relatively large. The waiters are also very enthusiastic, but the level needs to be further improved. Overall, it is the best in Jiuquan 
1	The rooms are clean and the bathrooms are well decorated. The breakfast is very hearty and the tofu brain is delicious! The traffic is very convenient. The soundproofing is not good enough. Our neighbor’s TV sounded loudly at 1 o’clock at night. After the complaint, the hotel staff went to negotiate with the neighbor next door to resolve it. 
0	This book formed a huge contrast with the popular TV broadcasts. I bought it as a reading book for the company's reading activities. As a result, no one finished it. It was really disappointing to write it like this. 
1	I scanned some of the pages and sent them to a friend who was discussing the books the children were reading with me. She was also attracted by it. After flipping through my bookshelf on the Internet, she also asked about the books she was interested in and discussed what I was buying. The reason for this book, the reaction that my little girl has read and so on. I really envy the children nowadays, who have such a wealth of spiritual food, and the parents' education methods tend to be rational, human and scientific. 
1	The breakfast buffet is very good, the service is very good, and I will stay next time. 
0	I bought this book only after seeing the recommendation. After reading it, I felt that it did not conform to my judgment of values. Haha, the ideas in the book are too realistic, but the examples given are too unrealistic. I don't understand why so many people recommend this book. . . 
1	I like AMD's chips, which are cost-effective. This kind of heat dissipation is good. Like AMD's chips, the price is good. This heat dissipation is good 
0	I wonder if it was her daughter who wrote this book! Very naive writing, very silly pen, very boring words, even if you have to write in the toilet several times a day, I think either the author is sick, or Japan is sick! ! ! I really can't tolerate this kind of thing, I bought this book for nothing! ! ! But one advantage is to teach children how to read 
1	"The photographs and texts in the book present a completely different time and space to readers. I think people who are passionate about the joy of this hardship can bear the hardship and feel that it is the joy of this spiritual experience that is extremely worthwhile. I yearn for it, but I also have self-knowledge. If I personally experience it, I will be totally troubled by suffering and not happy... So I compromised: sit in the most strange, practical and comfortable study room, rub the paper and watch. Bian sigh, Ye Gongzhiyue... (The verification code jumps out of the word ""Wu Suo"", quite interesting) "
1	"The long-awaited ""Little Reunion"" is finally available for a quick glance. After reading it, I feel that it is very consistent with the style of ""Classmates Are Not Cheap"", which can be called a sister article, and ""Floating Flower Waves"". The joys and sorrows of life in Zhang Ailing's writings are not a taste. Maybe it seems indifferent, but in fact it is the most true and deepest emotion, otherwise it won't hurt so badly. Indifference comes from helplessness. Corresponding to ""This Life and This Life"", I am dumbfounded by the narcissist's intricate outline, and sympathize with Zhang Ailing's trauma as a woman's feelings that can kill her life. After reading it, I only feel the desolation and loneliness of being born, and every word is endless aftertaste. "
0	This set of cats and mice was originally intended to be given to friends, but more than ten sets were delivered for the first time. Every one of them was well packaged and the quality was problematic. According to the delivery, it is more troublesome to exchange the goods. It is better to return the goods directly and place the order again. This is repeated several times, but the quantity I want has not been delivered. No way to complain! ! ! ! Sadly! ! ! ! But in general, this set of discs can only be said to be of high quality and low price. After reading it, it is found that it is not genuine and the image quality is average. Give it to you to think clearly! 
1	Our flight from Beijing to Hohhot was delayed for more than an hour, and it was a little over midnight when we arrived in Hohhot. For our two ordinary guests, the hotel specially sent a trolley to the airport to pick them up. Get on the bus to check in, and you can enter the room directly at the hotel, not bad! The rooms are clean and tidy, with perfect facilities and star service. No wrong choice, I will stay here next time. 
0	Speak well, and talk about the shortcomings, so as not to be trusted by others! The system is Linux on the command line. It is a little troublesome to modify XP, and most people can't figure it out! Secondly, the built-in camera imaging is not very good, only enough! The brand has no appeal, and all the rookies who don’t know how to buy a copy of it! 
0	1. Fingerprint! ! ! I don't understand why so many netbooks have to be designed with this material. Whether on the surface or the inside, they have to be wiped countless times a day, otherwise it is really ugly. 2. It is not easy to increase memory. 
1	The breakfast is good, the bathroom is good. The room is quite big, the location is 22 yuan taxi fare from Yuhuatai. 
0	"The style is a fast hotel, but the service is far from the title of excellent hotel. I live in a business double room, which is the single room closest to the end of the corridor. The room smells very strong, the gray sofa is dirty, and there are several broken In the cave, the network cable in the room is connected by rail, but there are no shops around the ""definitely impossible"", and I will not live in the future. "
1	I have been reading this book, although there are also reasons for guessing that my sister behaved like this, the first thing that comes to my mind, of course, is that my sister actually sees the sister fighting the illness too hard, although it seems that the sister has obtained the consent of the sister to do it. Returning to the decision-making power of her own medical treatment. The younger sister also protects her older sister from another angle. But unexpectedly, the younger sister is the guardian of the older sister, and the older sister is also the guardian of the younger sister. After all, she looks at the younger sister who loves her. , The parents also suffer together, and the sister also protects the people who love her... Seeing the final ending, I can't help but want to cry. It's worth watching! 
0	This talent is sparsely learned, so I really have no patience to read the book! Zhang Ailing is a talented girl, but unfortunately I am not. I decided not to buy her books in the future because it is too profound for me! 
1	I checked in on July 29th. The waiter on the 5th floor has a 5-star standard. The butler manager is amiable and has 5 stars, praise. It’s just that the height of the shower faucet is too low. 
1	"The first time I saw Qihui Qingshan's ""Good Weather for One"" was an excerpt from ""Youth Digest"". At that time, I felt that the text under the pen was like a trickling river flowing into my heart, and the faint list was lingering. When I got the book on the first day, I was sitting on the sofa in the library alone, and I forgot the time while reading, unconsciously felt that I was the heroine, and experienced the year’s spring, summer, autumn and winter laughter, pain and sadness. , Wuwei Chenza life is like this, it flows slowly, and when you meet the people you should meet, you go to different things, leaving endless nostalgia and memories, beautiful and moving "
0	The provided antivirus software is not good, Rising is on, and the CPU usage reaches about 50%. The laptop bag I sent was too stingy, and there was no Lenovo logo 
1	Friends who are interested in Qing history should not miss this book, and those who like Qing Chuan's novels should not miss this book. The analysis of Manchu culture in the book is more comprehensive and detailed. The author is the thirteenth generation grandson of Dai Shan, which can be imagined. The authority of the content. The binding quality of the book is very good, and there are many folk pictures in the late Qing Dynasty, I really like it. I feel very cordial to the old Beijing dialect that originated from Manchu. The culture needs to be passed on. With the immigration of Beijing, many old dialects in the local dialect are gradually inaudible. As a Beijinger, I feel a little regretful. This book can reflect it well. Old Beijing customs are worth studying and learning. 
1	The shell is very beautiful, piano paint, and very textured. The keyboard is also very comfortable. Take pictures, speed. . . . I think all kinds of things are good, and most importantly, my husband likes them very much. O(∩_∩)O~ ASUS is quite satisfactory. 
1	I admire Ruoxi, always insisting on finding love and refusing to be a little wife. So, this ending is the best. I read Menghui first, and then step by step. I can only say that each has its own merits. When I read Menghui, it was even more shocking. After all, it was the first book I read at that time. But looking at it step by step, it is even more memorable. The love in it is also worth savoring slowly. While loving each other, while hurting each other. Compared with the ridiculous stories of the idiot heroines that have been flooded, plus the super handsome and super infatuated heroes. Such a good book is really rare 
1	I think it is very good. I recommend it to many parents with children. I bought another one and gave it to a friend. I hope her baby can be healthy and happy and stay away from the hospital! 
0	The room is relatively poor, especially the bathroom, the soundproofing of the room and the food service are not good. 
0	Fingerprint machine. The price is slightly higher. Heat dissipation needs to be strengthened. Playing 720P HD movies is still a bit stuck. Slightly heavier. 
1	It seems like staying for the second time, this time the standard room environment is not good, the room does not feel clean, the TV is not good 
0	XP is super hard to install. Reluctant to find a professional on the Internet 40 yuan to get it. After trying for a few days, I am very satisfied. Let me publicize it: Xiaozhuang 13261821033. 
1	It’s still an old hotel, it’s noisy, the environment is very good, and the service is good. I went to live this Spring Festival and accidentally dropped my wallet in the hotel. After checking out and leaving, I received a call from the hotel. I finally returned home. ! I must live there in the future 
0	But the speed seems to be as fast as expected, and the battery is not as long as expected. It can only be used for 4.5 hours. 
1	The 2.5-inch 250G mobile hard disk provided by the machine is unopened, I want to sell it, and I am interested in short-term contact, Beijing 1391019711 
0	Not as good as expected. After reading it, I feel even more distrustful of the so-called domestic psychologists. Do not go to the consultation easily. 
1	It was not bad this time, but the flowers in the room were too out of style. 
0	I read the first few chapters carefully, and I was disappointed. I was disgusted with this kind of argument that only generalized? Girls want to be realistic? There is no actual method of operation. The examples are not convincing. They are all made up by themselves. Name and story. In short~~~ I won’t buy the so-called true meaning of life on the bestseller list in the future. People who have not lived to enter the coffin, let alone understand life. 
1	The author uses detailed reports on data processing and calculation results to support his new views. Why did the Netherlands once have the highest productivity in Europe? Why do China and Japan, which have a profound cultural bond, have a huge difference in economic development? Why did the British North American colonies create an economically powerful United States, while the Spanish North American colonies created an exuberant Mexico? ...Very valuable, but does not include [Modern Chinese History]. 
1	This book is really funny for two consecutive days during the holiday! The heroes and heroines are close to life, although I have never been in contact with the underworld; as for the heroine, there are Gan Jiren around. In fact, it’s not a big deal for a divorced woman. She can recognize her favorites at the moment, and she’s all right. The male protagonists are all tied, caring and loving the sweetheart. I like the plot of the hero and the heroine together, and the dialogue from the ground is sometimes similar to the friends around me. I was wrong! I hope the author can write more works that are similar to funny but close to life. I hope everyone likes this work! 
1	Staying in a suite in the Executive Building for three days in late April is generally satisfactory, but there are still the following opinions: 1. Maybe the corridors and kitchens are a bit musty after the longer renovation, and the kitchen equipment has been severely yellowed for a long time. 2. The elevators and residents There are only two sharing machines. Sometimes it takes a long time to wait. 3. From the elevator to the front desk, it is a little inconvenient to go through a small staircase of about six steps. 4. It is fairly convenient to live. The opposite is Jusco. 5. If you can provide simple pots , I want to be more in line with the definition of Ang's equipment. Hotel Feedback May 16, 2008: Thank you for choosing to stay at the MasterCard Hotel and giving the hotel valuable suggestions. The hotel currently provides simple kitchen utensils. Due to the limited quantity, generally free pots and tableware are provided for guests to use when they need them. Hope you choose to stay at the Master Hotel again. 
1	The environment is beautiful, the waiters are enthusiastic and generous, and feel at home. Next time I go to Fuzhou, I will still live in Yushan Hotel! ! I still can’t forget the breakfast there @_@ 
0	"The formaldehyde content in the hotel room is too high, which seriously affects the health of the guests. I stayed at 932, and almost got smothered when I opened the door. The next day I opened the door and was thundered again. Changed room 626, the condition is slightly better, but there are three stains on the sheets , There was a reaction with the reception desk when checking out, and it seemed that there was no reaction. For breakfast, you must eat at the speed of the waiter withdrawing the plates, otherwise nothing will be left on the table. Additional review July 6, 2008 Day: Ha, just finished staying, the hotel price dropped from 450 to 418, next time I will ""bargain"" with Ctrip "
1	The location is very good, just upstairs of DFS, it closes later than other specialty stores in the evening, so you can enjoy shopping at last. It is also very close to Harbour City, 2-3 minutes walk. The hotel facilities and services are very good. There are multi-purpose adapters in the room. Almost any plug can be switched. It is really convenient to forget to buy one when you go. You can use it in any country in the future. The service staff is very kind. The room is not too big, the distance between the two beds is only one seam, but other hardware facilities are good, with LCD TV, the bathroom is a bit like the Sanya Sheraton Hotel, but the bathroom has a window to this room, you can take a bath While watching TV in the room. Newly renovated room. Support, live next time. 
0	Breakfast is 30, cannot be refunded, nor can it be expected, it is too unreasonable. I will not book this hotel in the future. The room is smelly and the decoration is too bad. 
0	1. Insufficient 1G memory 2. There is a big gap on the left side of the screen. 3. There is no drive disk, so it is troublesome to find it by yourself. 4. The interface is vertical and inconvenient 
1	Overall good! The room was originally set for 298 yuan, because it only arrived in the early morning, and it was upgraded to a deluxe room on the 15th floor for free. You can also see the sea view. I didn't change my room for three days (Thursday to Sunday). It's worth it! The room facilities are OK, up to 3 stars, but the washbasin tap is leaking. The 16th floor is the restaurant. My room is just below the restaurant. One day, their employees had a party all afternoon! The restaurant upstairs seems to be closed? The Yiqing Building downstairs is said to be a well-known restaurant in Qingdao. It is quite hot and tastes good, and the price is similar to the beer street. There is a big shopping mall 200 meters down, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. Can live! 
0	It’s annoying to install XP system to switch back to IDO interface, but install Vista is no problem! Also, on the day I just bought it, I gave things here, and I lost a lot. . . . 
0	I ordered seven books. There was a set of things from the Ming Dynasty. I finally received the book, but only one book by Zhu Yuanzhang was ordered by me. The other six messy books were sent to me without knowing how to call. I have been busy in the past. Outcry. I really don't know how to deal with this matter. 
0	The service is ok! Others are about the same level as the guest house. The network is often bad! Not recommended! 
1	When I got it, I felt that the quality was better than expected, and it was quite light (this may not be an advantage...), the screen was not broken, of course, the most important thing was cheap and affordable. 
0	My baby is ten months old. He is usually interested in all kinds of colorful books and pictures, but he is completely disinterested in this set of books. I just read the first page and the last back cover and left it aside. I Guess maybe he is not old enough to like cartoon books, so he can only try to read it later. 
0	Reading a few chapters of this book is hard to finish! The content seems to be something *** propaganda, which makes people obedient, tolerate everything, and emphasize adjusting their mood. Similar to Ah Q's self-relieving spirit. Reading this book can't make people refreshed, let alone make people motivated, and it's not like prose. In short, super work is better than the value of this book! 
0	The heat is large. . . But worth the price. In addition, the system is extremely difficult to install. . . People who don’t understand are advised to be cautious, it is really troublesome 
1	This Lenovo computer has excellent workmanship, complete functions, LED screen, and Intel PRO/Wireless 5100AGN wireless network card. It’s easy to install XP by yourself, unlike some general computers, it’s hard to install XP. 
1	The rooms are large, well decorated and good service. . . As far as the room is concerned, it is not inferior to 5 stars and will stay 
1	Good performance and high cost performance. It is a good choice for programming. The integrated graphics card is sufficient, and there is no need to worry about large heat dissipation. The fan heat dissipation is also very good. 
0	The decoration of the rooms in Jinjiang VIP Building is okay, and the environment is average. I think the catering service during my stay was poor. For example, he told me 68 yuan when I ordered, but 98 yuan at checkout. And the price is relatively high. 
0	The hotel is under renovation, and the overall feeling is particularly bad. The front entrance is not allowed, the car is not allowed to stop, and the service staff does not assist in finding a parking place. What is the five-star service level? The hygienic condition of the room is not ideal, and the spare parts are not like five-star products, such as toothbrushes are simply inferior products. The overall soft service of the hotel also needs to be improved. It can be seen that it is a hotel with very general management and the overall quality of the service staff is average. 
1	(1) The appearance of this notebook is pretty. Does it weigh? It's not heavy for me. (2) After installing WindowsXP system, it runs very fast. The heat is not as big as expected. Maybe you haven't run a resource-intensive program yet, and don't feel the ills of memory. However, 1G of memory is indeed a bit small. (3) The bag that comes with it is very good and feels good. But the included mouse is too small. Fortunately, I ordered a Shuangfeiyan mouse at the same time. 
0	No matter how good the writing is, the shamelessness cannot be erased! Hu Lancheng tried to hide his shamelessness with beautiful love, but even if he sprayed on perfume, the shit would not turn into flowers. He was indiscriminately sentimental, shot a shot to change a place, killed many women, but thought that he gave these women happiness and shameless! He is reluctant, and his wife is seriously ill and dying, but he refuses to rush back to see the last time because he is afraid of the weather and the road. He treats the contempt of others as the fear and concession of others, and he regards the alienation of others It's someone else who doesn't dare to come close, ridiculous! But fortunately, he is so self-righteous, I don't know the so-called, otherwise, how can he have the face to be a traitor and still be so proud? 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the battery is more durable, the hard drive is very quiet (Seagate, better than msiU90 WD) 
1	Cost-effective! The mirror screen is big enough, much larger than the new-style widescreen of 14.1! The graphics card is recognized as 3430. The driver CD has all the drivers (the camera software is also in it). The speakers are also good. Value for money! 
0	White is easy to get dirty, why are there no other colors? The battery life is not as high as the legend. As for other shortcomings, this price is the same 
0	I didn't think there was anything in this hotel before, and I was very depressed after staying twice recently. For the first time, I booked a day, and the next day the hotel front desk manager said that I could not continue my stay. The first time I met, Ctrip also helped the hotel speak. Today I live in a hotel without air conditioning, a three-star hotel, unimaginable, the waiter's solution is to give me an electric fan, super funny. It is normal for the staff of Ctrip to say that the hotel does not have air conditioning. I really don’t know if Ctrip’s commission is a bit too easy. If there is no answer, aside from the hotel, I think my trust in Ctrip will be greatly reduced. Up. 
1	The encounters in life are not to torture a person, but to shape a person. The sweetest fruits are often those with flaws and defects. I know that I am better educated than many people with diplomas, but I am tired of arguing. Although you don't speak much, with my understanding, I don't need to let you speak a lot. The troubled person doesn't want to talk much. Learn to be patient and persistent. The bigger your dream, the longer it will take to realize your dream. When you have the urge to speak, listen first. But when you have the urge to shrink, act first. 
0	The words are too small, and it’s too tired to read while lying down. There is a lot of space about eating. I live alone, so I don’t want to spend so much time at home tossing and eating. 
0	The noise is loud. Side A is a bit too light, and the plastic feel is too strong. What is made under the HP brand is not like the things made by big brands. Personally recommend Acer, although the configuration of this machine is high but not in line with the price, it is not worth it. I recommend not just pursuing big brands. Asus and Acer are better than HP-at least in terms of workmanship and noise.

1	The appearance is very good, and the speed is also good. After I bought it and reinstalled the system, I downloaded it for two consecutive days. 
0	I added a 2G Samsung 800 memory. The original memory is 667. If it is 667, it will be fine. The CUP is slightly worse. 
0	Very disappointed, I don't know how the four stars were obtained. The single standard room, 328, the room is very small. There is always the sound of running water, maybe it's heating? The soundproofing is also very poor. My room is next to the waiter's room. I started activities early in the morning, assigned work or something, woke me up, and never had a chance to fall asleep. There is only Coke in the small refrigerator in the room. If you want to drink beer at night, be careful and bring your own. There are many types of breakfast, but the restaurant is too cold because I am late? Breakfast is also cold. 
0	The edition of this book is average, I don’t dare to say that it is pirated, but...it looks like...but, just take a look, this book has nothing to collect. 
1	The first time I read this book was three years ago, when I borrowed this book from the library for Chi Zijian. Who knows that you can't let it go anymore, so I recommended the students in the dormitory to read it together. My requirement for buying literature books is to buy them after reading them three times. I watched it three times, and every time I saw it, I felt sad for that nation, so I decided to buy it. I went to the bookstore to find it, but I couldn't find it. Two years later, I happened to see this book from Dangdang. Although it was not the version I was reading, I still bought it, just for the book itself. 
0	There is indeed a gap when it is closed, and there is not much impact when it is new, so I don't know what will happen to it. 
0	The heat dissipation is average. I don’t think this function is automatically shielded when the network card is not connected to the power supply and the network cable is not connected. I heard that it is to save power. 
1	The product is compact in appearance, stable in performance, complete and powerful, suitable for office and student use, the price is particularly suitable, and the dell brand and after-sales guarantee 
1	This set of books has wild imagination, vivid and interesting story lines, and many knowledge points. It is a great set of popular science books. Younger children are suitable for sub-volumes related to water, bees, solar system, hurricanes, etc. They not only like to listen, but also rush to answer questions. The content of various rocks, wonderful electricity, human sensory organs, etc. is a bit abstract and incomprehensible for children. It is something that will only be encountered in the classroom above junior high school. The story is also relatively long. I told my just six-year-old son. When listening, he has no patience to hear the last, wait until he grows up to watch. 
1	I bought this book together with the Japanese Parenting Encyclopedia. When the book arrived, I felt that the packaging was in place. It was a little dusty after opening, but the effect was not significant. I wrapped it in old calendar paper and hoped to use it longer. This book, as recommended by everyone on the Internet, starts from the psychology of children and adults, and writes well about raising children. When the new book arrived, a female colleague of mine saw it. She probably said a sentence after reading it. Although it is a bit exaggerated, it truly reflects her recognition of the book: My child is 9 years old, and I feel that I have raised a child for nothing! 
0	Very poor, I ordered a deluxe suite but I feel that I have just been vacuumed, nothing is really bad, let alone I am in 
0	Seeing so many people buying, I also bought a book. The content is very empty, and I regret that there are not many substantive items. I should not blindly follow the trend. Because I tried to buy a book for the first time in Dangdang, I feel that the speed is good, and the order is within 3 days. The goods arrived. The overall feeling is a little slower than the excellent, but the express service attitude is a little better. The only good thing is that the express fee is free 
1	The N280 is obviously faster than the N270, and it is not stuck when playing 720P movies. The CPU occupancy rate is about 50-60%. The mold work is more exquisite. Although the paint is easy to collect fingerprints, the texture is indeed much better than ordinary plastics. It's really strong, don't turn on the wireless network card, Bluetooth and speakers, watch PDF documents, adjust the brightness to 4 frames, and you can use it for about 8 hours. The heat on the keyboard surface is quite small, 
0	I have just been working for more than a year. After reading this book, I really feel a lot of things that I don’t understand at work, and I have strengthened my belief in my heart. A very good book! 
1	The workmanship is good, better than my THINKPAD R61, the configuration is cost-effective, and the price is cheap. It used to be more than 7,000 yuan, but now it is more than 4,000. 
0	1: As netizens said, the bottom of the screen is cracked. 2: No fingerprint recognition. 3: Driver (xp) is not included. 4: The sound is average, so is it for commercial machines, but the sound is loud enough 
1	Stayed a few times and it feels okay. But this time I couldn't fall asleep in the cold at night. Put on sweaters and trousers, covered with 3 quilts, exaggerated? There is also hot air in the air conditioner, but the room temperature is low and it is not very cold outside. I really don't understand. Changed a room, still the same. Had to check out! 
1	The first time I read this book eagerly, I feel that my spiritual instructor has finally appeared for so many years. I have made almost all the mistakes made by many parents mentioned in the book. The result of the same problem handled by Teacher Wang It made me startled, so when I read it the second time, I took notes seriously, sorted out the cases and solutions in the book, and then implemented them according to them. The effect is really good. The communication with the child is happy, and the child is excited about learning. It’s getting higher and everything is developing in a good direction. Thanks to Teacher Wang for his book. I hope all parents can read it. You will benefit a lot! 
0	Jingdong cut prices too fast. 5199 when I bought it. It was 4,999 in a few days. A direct loss of 200 yuan. It feels like the book has been castrated. The portion is very light... 
0	Very broken hotel, does not accompany the four-star standard, at most it is a two-star and barely. The hotel is a huge entertainment venue. There are nightclubs and sauna applications in it, and harassment calls one after another at night. The decoration of the room is very old, and the TV is not watched. What's even more funny is that although there is a network cable on the table, there is no socket, so don't you need to charge your laptop? 
1	Good price-performance ratio; reasonable collocation; good design appearance. The sound of the fan is a bit loud, and the standard memory is too small. It is said that it is an LED screen, and the eyes hurt after watching it for a long time. The whole machine is slightly heavier and can achieve the purpose of exercising. 
0	Why don't we notify if there is no stock? ? ? I just received the book I ordered, but this one is missing, so depressed! 
0	"From the beginning to the end of sexual depression, a lot of space is devoted to repetitive and unchanged psychological activities, which is of little significance. Originally a very simple story, it was written so long but still looked very thin, the character image is flat like a piece of paper, but such a book is so popular with so many people, but it is very interesting, is it now that Chinese people desire ""pure love"" This level? Really depressing. "
0	The memory is too small and slow like a snail. I started with 5599. The graphics card is too poor and too heavy to carry! There should be some room for price reduction. 
1	The performance is good, satisfactory, and the configuration is reasonable! The appearance is also beautiful, and the portrait recognition is always fun! Watch HD smoothly! 
0	I ordered a book, which was very good, but when I read it, I found that one page was missing. Then I applied for a replacement, but Dangdang didn't care about me. So I suggest you not to buy things in Dangdang. I'm finished, thank you. 
0	The room and service of this hotel are very poor. The receptionist seems to have a grudge against others, without a smile at all. Breakfast is said to be until 9 o'clock, but the meal is cold at 8 o'clock. Ask the service staff if they are hot Yes, people are like eating or not, making us very uncomfortable. The room still smelled of mold. I really don’t know why Ctrip cooperated with this company, never live in this one again, and advise everyone not to go. 
1	JD’s logistics really didn’t say that the delivery came in less than a day, the process was very clear, and it was used before Wuyi! The white books are really beautiful, the quality is super good, the price is the lowest I have seen, and my colleagues are also very envious. I do a good job promotion for Jingdong! 
1	"To be honest, I saw this title and decided to buy it! Because in everyone’s eyes, I am an out-and-out ""angry youth""~ I didn’t know until I really read that the socialist angry youth also had such extraordinary youth...From West Germany to East Germany to the Soviet Union, Finally settled in China~ The protagonist broke through the towering Berlin Wall for most of his life, and also broke through the understanding and understanding of socialism in his heart~ I think now that the author thinks of the previous ""angry youth"" time must be ridiculous~ but it is these The simplest faith has made the author's beautiful life now! "
0	The graphics card driver was recognized as G96, and it was recognized as 110M after installing the new version of the driver. It was a bit stuck and I don’t know what happened! 
0	Be firm in the idea and not buy any books that are hyped next time. What kind of writing is so fascinating that he will not be sick when he pinches it. He wants to be so fascinating. He has long been used by state leaders to firmly believe that he will not buy any books that are hype. I feel that this book is a book of superstitions. , 
0	The VISTA system is really bad, I changed to XP when I came back, but the THINK driver doesn't support XP very much? After changing the XP SATA hard disk, it can only be changed to IDE mode. The graphics card cannot be hot-switched. The wireless network needs to be updated to other software. Bluetooth cannot be used. Hey, it can be used after changing to WIN7 
1	Good security protection, dual system disks, no need to worry about driver problems, easy-to-use keyboard, Lenovo customer service attitude is really good! 
1	"When I read articles, especially comments, the main reason is whether the author is sincere. I like this book after reading the preface. Explains the value of current reviews and why the book is named ""Common Sense"". Many of the values or other opinions that we have been influenced by the so-called ""mainstream media"" and cannot be independently formed are actually very questionable. Moreover, common sense is often the kind of thinking you think in reverse. This kind of thought often surfaced in our minds in real time, but after Mr. Liang broke it apart and smashed it into pieces, people could not help but sigh. Hope that every young person has such common sense. "
0	When closing the lid, it feels very hard; vx600x is not a VX600 after all. Many Xs are a lot worse, VISTA system; Core becomes Celeron; there is no so-called ECHO brightness mode; ATI graphics card driver must be installed first. over and over again 
0	I stayed in a single double room for one night on October 25, and I felt bad: 1. Check in at around 22:30 in the evening, the reception at the front desk was very cold, without a smile, and felt unkind; 2. The most terrible thing was the shower after 3 minutes of shower The faucet stopped water, and the bathtub faucet stopped completely after 2 minutes. There was no way to call the lobby from the bathroom and asked someone to come up and take a look. At this time, it was found that there was no bathrobe in the room. The assistant manager in the lobby came up and told that there are other rooms. In a similar situation, due to the recent management and maintenance near the hotel. It is only recommended to change the room 
0	Just a few pages are about sex and caution, or the last few pages. I don’t like it. There is no head or tail. It doesn’t make sense to look at it. After buying it, I feel very bad. It feels like being fooled. The quality of the book is not special. It’s so good, you get what you pay for. In order to make more money, I also wrote novels that are not the title of the book and published them together. I feel that the grade has dropped a lot, and I won’t buy it again next time. 
1	The transportation is convenient, the rooms are relatively dry, quiet and spacious, and overall it is fair. 
1	This is the first notebook I bought. I originally wanted to order it from Toshiba, but it was out of stock. This widescreen one is very beautiful. When I open it, it is not pure black, but it is a bit dark blue. I like it very much. It is more troublesome to install XP. I got half of the blue screen, and there is no partition prompt. I have to consult the customer to get it done. The noise is small, not bad, and the sound quality is good. 
0	The display resolution is 1024*576. Many things are not displayed completely. Why not design it to 1024*600? The fan noise is relatively loud. Installing Linux on the hard disk is not as good as directly dividing the partitions and installing nothing. 
0	The piano paint is easy to leave fingerprints and cannot enter the system. The sound is very loud when it is turned on. I have already sent it back for a replacement. I hope that Jingdong can send it back for me soon, although I encountered such bad luck the first time I bought something on Jingdong. , But still believe in Jingdong, and hope you do better. 
1	In general, such a hotel with such a price is not bad, I hope he will decorate as soon as possible, and leave a good impression on my guests 
0	My book is missing ten pages, which seriously affects reading! Dangdang is such a big bookstore, how could such a problem arise? I suspect that my book is pirated. 
1	The facilities are not new, the rooms are medium in size, all with a side view of the sea, and there is a non-smoking floor. Breakfast is relatively ordinary, not many choices. 
1	The white piano paint is very beautiful and the sound effect is great. For surfing the Internet, doing some text office, watching movies, as long as it is not a super blockbuster, the key is the convenience. The battery used 5 and a half hours in continuous office 
0	No matter how good the writing is, the shamelessness cannot be erased! Hu Lancheng tried to hide his shamelessness with beautiful love, but even if he sprayed on perfume, the shit would not turn into flowers. He was indiscriminately sentimental, shot a shot to change a place, killed many women, but thought that he gave these women happiness and shameless! He is reluctant, and his wife is seriously ill and dying, but he refuses to rush back to see the last time because he is afraid of the weather and the road. He treats the contempt of others as the fear and concession of others, and he regards the alienation of others It's someone else who doesn't dare to come close, ridiculous! But fortunately, he is so self-righteous, I don't know the so-called, otherwise, how can he have the face to be a traitor and still be so proud? 
1	Special thanks to Miss Cui (mobile number 136134462**) with job number 0649, and you must thank her in person next time you travel to Taiyuan on business. I checked in on April 10th. I caught the flight early on the 11th and left a necklace in the guest room. I didn’t find it until I got home. Ms. Cui took the initiative to call and verify with me, and she paid for it and sent it back for me. And I went to the post office many times to help me inquire, this kind of spirit is too rare. thank you very much! There is indeed a black car in front of the hotel. I had a general impression of the hotel, but it is very touching to have such staff. Will definitely stay next time I go to Taiyuan! 
0	This is the worst hotel I have booked in Ctrip. The price is expensive and I will not stay again in the future. 
1	I am a new investor. Before I read this book, I used other people’s recommendations when trading stocks. I would not judge whether it was bottom or top, washing or shipping. For a period of time, I didn't make any money, but I lost a lot. After reading this book, I feel a lot. I think it can accurately reflect the current position of the stock price of self-selected stocks. It is safe to trade stocks. It has clear opinions, rich examples, strong practicality, easy-to-understand analysis, vivid language, and warm and touching. It is an excellent training textbook suitable for investors at the junior and intermediate levels. 
0	1. No matter what you install, it must be installed in the hard disk, so you have to find the hard disk. This is a serial hard disk (SATA). The earlier version of the software does not recognize it, so the hard disk cannot be found, and the installation of xp shows a blue screen. It's difficult, so you must have a serial hard drive! ! ! 
0	Originally, it was clearly stated on the order that there should be a suite with a computer and Internet access, but when I checked in, the wine said that there was no suite but the Internet was not allowed. Later, I was transferred to a regular suite, which felt very bad. The room was very poor in hygiene, and the bedding was not changed. There are black marks and yellow spots. The waiter explained that it can't be washed off after changing it, which is incomprehensible. The towels are also dark and I have not dared to use them. The toilet has a strong smell. 
1	Heqing is really good. The business single room I live in is very large, with complete facilities and a very warm feeling. What makes me particularly satisfied is the hill behind the hotel. I walked up along the path. There are many trees and some blooming flowers. One side of the hill is clear water and some small islands in the distance, especially in summer. very comfortable. Next time I will live in Heqing. 
1	The appearance is elegant, the continuation time is long, the running speed is OK, the service attitude of Chengdu self-pickup is satisfied, and the delivery is very fast. 
1	The performance of the computer is good and very real. Orders placed on the evening of May 5 were mentioned in the Asian Games Village on the afternoon of May 6, and the speed was very fast. 
1	"After reading this book, there is always a feeling of conflict in my heart. Like joy, but also sad. We are often very stingy with our love, and often report it tightly to our chests. When I meet the one I love, I will carefully let go of my hand to give warmth to another person. When I turned over the first page of this book, the color page surprised me-a fire! When I saw the words below, my heart began to burn gently. ""Lighting a fire is like igniting the love of a lifetime!"" Yes, so much! "
1	Lightweight, compact, excellent workmanship, fast calculation speed, in line with the image of a big brand, the details are considered very thoughtful. 
1	This book was ordered by my daughter to buy it. I didn’t know that their class was watching this. She pointed to the advertisement on a bottle of drink and told me, because my grandma only found books about this game strategy on the book stand. So I can only find her online. I am naturally very happy to buy it home. The book has been taken to school and it has almost been ripped out. Because my daughter likes it, I gave it 4 stars. If I clicked it, it might only have 1 star, because this so-called game maze book is really not Well, if you really play the maze in the book, it will hurt your eyes. The font layout is unreasonable, just look at the picture. Hey... 
0	Compared with the CQ series purchased last year, the workmanship has dropped significantly. Moreover, it is very troublesome to install the system. After all the installation is completed, the problem of no boot music cannot be solved, but this is entirely a problem of HP. I wouldn't recommend her to buy HP unless her classmates insisted. 
0	"After reading it, I think it's very general. But it has not yet reached the level that requires so many people to criticize Yu Dan. Philosophy is the knowledge of ""the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom"". Everyone has their own opinions, so it is normal to criticize. Yu Dan became famous too quickly, and the Chinese have a bad habit of ""to irritate others, but not to laugh at others"", so criticism is normal. Intellectuals in ancient times emphasized ""safe and happy, not be surprised, indifferent to fame, quiet and far-reaching."" They can use the doctrine of sages to preach. Selling books and seeking profit may not be in line with the values of being a scholar, so criticism is normal. However, I can understand. "
1	very good. One of the best hotels in the country. Good in every way. 
1	To be honest, when reading this book, sometimes I really feel reluctant to read it. When reading a book, the mood will fluctuate with the content of the book. I admire everything the male protagonist does for the one he loves. When I bought this book, my original intention was to see what a person who loves me like life is like. After reading, I know that two people who love each other can only exchange for a sincere relationship if they give to each other~~~ The heroine did it. Their love and everything they did on the road of love are worthy of their own. life...... 
0	This is a conference and event-oriented hotel, not suitable for individual guests to spend their weekends. The room is larger but the furniture is poor. The worst is the bathroom, which is of poor quality. Booked for two nights and checked out early because I couldn't stand the cold in the room. It was early winter. Recommendation: Bring a sleeping bag to avoid catching a cold. 
0	Too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot too hot 
0	The sound has a popping sound, it is very troublesome to install the system and the driver. I am a professional and I have been engaged for a day 
0	Delivery is super slow~ Still called express delivery? ! ! It has been 9 days, but it hasn't arrived yet, even if it is only delivered on working days, 7 days have passed. What are you doing~! 
0	"So-so, too much attention to one-sided introduction, after buying it, I feel that it is not suitable for me. At the same time, it reminds you to buy books you are interested in in the future, or it becomes a display. ""Books can't be read without borrowing"" "
0	Without an operating system, it took a lot of time to install it by myself, and the driver is very troublesome, and the CD-ROM drive is loud and powerful. 
1	At first I saw this book in the school library. I didn't come and borrowed it. When I came back and checked it on Dangdang, there was actually a 40-50% discount. The print quality of the book is absolutely beyond doubt. The most intoxicating thing is not only the introduction of the 100 world famous paintings, but also the delicate and moving descriptions. The editor's words are absolutely comparable to these classic paintings. The vivid introduction after the illustration makes every tiny detail of the pictures that we have long understood and become so familiar and meaningful. It should be one of the 100 books you want to read. It has the capital to be affirmed by everyone who loves art. 
0	"The smell in the rooms and corridors is very heavy. The sound on the road outside the building is very noisy. The sound of the TV next door in the morning can be heard clearly and can be used as an alarm clock, but the time is set next door and the ""alarm clock"" is not timed. The invoice was not stamped for me when I checked the account. The general feeling is disappointing. Will not live again in the future. "
0	I like AMD's chips, which are cost-effective. This kind of heat dissipation is good, like AMD's chip, good price 
0	"The book that I ordered on November 21st, and 9 books together with this one, have not been received in 11 days until today! During the call to the customer service to ask, it is disgusting that the customer service rolls his tongue and thinks it sounds good. ""Then I can't help it."" He didn't say to check with me. This service will kill you sooner or later! Dangdang: Your customers will decrease! You wait and see! You go on to fool you! "
0	It's not as good as expected, and the writing is too casual, just a random combination of sketches and letters. Not to mention systematic knowledge introduction. 
0	I flipped it over and put it down. honestly. . The picture is not cute. . . The content did not look closely. . Doesn't attract me. . . 
0	There is no legendary XP recovery CD, and it does not seem to support 802.11n and WIFI. Please check with the moderator. 
0	After using it for half a month, I feel just one word: cool! Good workmanship, low price, fast delivery, nothing to say, one word: good! 
1	Equipped with a balanced price ratio, playing ordinary games should be able to sustain it. The 250G hard disk is bigger, so you can put more things. Webcam 1.3 million pixel camera, card reader, wireless network card basically have. Independent graphics card ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3470 Video memory capacity of independent 256MB can be regarded as a relatively high chip in the same price. ASUS is quite professional! 
1	I have liked his poems for a long time, but that name is Mandelstam. Now this one doesn't sound very accustomed. The printing of this version should be nothing to say, very good. It's just that the conditions are good now, and there is no time to read poetry. This can't be a sorrow. Believe that Mr. Wang, Madam Lan’s poems are so good, naturally the level of the two people should be unexplainable, wait until winter when it snows to lie on the bed before reading... 
1	The memory is used well, it is actually 1G ddr3, which looks a bit like Sony, has a camera and a microphone, and has a relatively complete configuration 
1	Among similar products at the same price, the overall configuration is pretty good. It’s very smooth to install VISTA 
0	JD 1: The overall service of JD is average, unlike an 11-year-old enterprise (2009-4-24 orders, invoices have not yet been given to me, disappointed). 2: The first question is if there is a responsibility system, customer service is meaningless, don't think that the customer is okay to ask for trouble, ask your questions without answering me, it is like a state-owned enterprise 
0	I only feel that the pre-installed linux system of the merchant is really uncomfortable, and I have never contacted it before. It is recommended that merchants pre-install other systems in the future 
0	I bought 15 copies of Xiaoxiong**** and received the book yesterday. The books I came to occasionally have the feeling that some books are a little old, but in general it is ok. But this time it is too much ____15 books, no One is clean, and 4 of them are glued together after being damp (the book is not damaged on the road, the outside packaging is good). I want to ask, would you give such a book to your child as a gift yourself ? I will send you 4 precious broken books. It is just for you to use as teaching materials. Take a look. In the future, such books can also be sent. 
1	If you are a super lazy person like me and want to take supplements, the most acceptable food supplement should be the juice. Peel, throw into the juicer, and drink it. The food supplement is completed in three steps without the need for soot. It doesn’t need to be simmered for several hours on low heat. Related vitamins and supplements can be added. Because cooking books can’t be commented on their effects after reading them, only a few of the tastes that have been tried are considered good. If you lose your job in the future, you may be able to set up a small stall to sell health-care juice. 
0	"The quality of the book is not good, it will be broken when you flip it, and the content of the book is not good, it is useless, and it is not funny! It's simply not as good as ""I am an English word book""! ! I suggest you not buy it! ! "

It is too bad, whoever lives is SB Free registration website navigation Hotel index service description About Ctrip's recruitment of talented agents to cooperate advertising business contact We are Copyright1999-2008, ctrip.com. all rights reserved. 
1	The price/performance ratio is good, nothing to say. What is more fancy is that the HP brand can also have such a high price/performance ratio. 
1	Room facilities \ decoration are good, the environment is elegant, reception \ checkout service is good, star enough. 
1	1: The size of the product is very good, smaller than the x61, but it still doesn’t look like the x61 atmosphere. After the X61 was dropped last time, I thought of buying a netbook. If you use it as a master notebook, it is recommended to buy it. A little bit. 2: But now you can buy 3G Kingbook for the same price 
0	The book I bought the day before yesterday has been dropped today. Is it a bit too unreasonable? Can you give me an explanation, or I will reject it and buy it again! 
0	The hotel is relatively old, close to the airport and can hear a lot of noise. The air conditioner is not turned on, the smell in the house is dizzy when the window is closed, the window is basically noisy, and the breakfast is very poor. 
0	I just don’t have a system disk. I installed XP for a whole afternoon. I changed a few disks before installing. It is recommended not to use Gaost. But the motherboard chip is GM45. I used several software to test all GM45, which is different from the PM45 mentioned on the Internet. I don’t know. what's going on 
1	The hotel facilities are a bit old, but it is located in the city center, the transportation is convenient, and the service is also very good. Ctrip's booking price is very reasonable, and it can be used as a business trip 
0	The system is too difficult to install. I first partitioned with diskgen and winpe, and then installed the XP disk with a step-by-step installation, and then copied the image to the hard disk, and then went into winpe to install with ghost32. After a tossing afternoon, I finally got it... 39M's Zang Division tortured me to death 
1	But it is said to be the originator of CSS design. The book describes in detail many problems that CSS needs to solve in the design process, such as fonts, pictures, and color matching. Different from the domestic general CSS which uses grammar or case as the main line of explanation, the book adopts a design problem-oriented approach. Each chapter uses a typical example as the main line of the chapter. These examples are representative. A collection of solutions to a type of design problem. This book is suitable for reading carefully when you are calm, especially by practicing the examples in the book, you can discover your own design inspiration for CSS. 
0	"Those who read her ""Analects"" and ""Zhuangzi"" think the former is good. The feeling of this book is that preparations are very hasty. "
1	Time is speed. The price a year ago is too far behind the present. I think I don’t need to change this one for two years. It’s worth it. 
1	It looks good and suitable for girls. The order placed yesterday afternoon will be picked up this morning. 
1	"It can be said that this is the best book about children's education I have ever read. The key is to teach parents to change some of their mindsets and concepts, such as ""No matter the best management"", ""Refuse to punish homework"" and so on. The author is indeed an expert in educational psychology, who can think and deal with problems from the perspective of children's psychology, which convinces me. Read it all in one breath, and want to read it again and again. It is recommended to the leaders of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China to read it. Perhaps it can give some inspiration to the reform of China's college entrance examination (the current imperial examination system). "
1	The room is a bit small, but clean and very affordable. The disadvantage is that there is only one set of bath products for the double room. Feedback from the hotel August 5, 2008: Dear guest: Hello! Thank you for choosing to stay at Jinling Liyang Hotel! Regarding the problem that there is only one set of toiletries in the hotel’s double room, we have convened relevant hotel departments to conduct research and rectification on this issue. Try our best to fulfill our management and service work, pay more attention to guests and details! Once again, I would like to express our most heartfelt thanks to you! Looking forward to your coming to Liyang again and staying at Jinling Liyang Hotel! Let us have the opportunity to provide you with better service! I wish you success in your work! Healthy body! Director of Guest Relations at Jinling Liyang Hotel 
1	The performance configuration is regarded as the best in the same price, and the heat dissipation of the business machine has been doing well, which is worthy of praise 
0	The location of the hotel is not ideal. It is quite close to Jinyuan Shopping Center, about 10 minutes' drive. I stayed in room 448, which was just in time for the meeting of the Ministry of Health. There were a lot of people. In addition, there was a door between the two rooms. The sound insulation effect is particularly bad. I was awakened by the sound of the affection next door in the middle of the night and dizzy 
1	A very good book. It looks like a romantic novel, but it contains a lot of art and historical facts. For the first time I really felt the life of the royal family in the Song Dynasty, and vaguely felt that such a description was more appropriate. Their clothing, speech, residence, and emotions are very different from their previous consciousness. But everything like this is so mysterious and attractive. Their emotions are no different from those of ordinary people, but their processing methods and choices are too different from ordinary people. Helpless but had to do it. In fact, not only the royal family, but even ordinary people, how helpless are there? 
0	Only the DOS system is installed, and the system installation disk is not included. When XP is installed, the graphics card driver is not available, so you have to ask for after-sales service, which is more troublesome; the heat dissipation is not good. After a few minutes, it feels a bit hot to touch with your hand, and you need to buy a radiator to help it dissipate heat. 
0	The front desk, including the front desk of the service restaurant, is very unkind, as if we owe them money, it means we can’t live in love, and doesn’t feel respected at all 
1	What I got is a perfect screen, and the speed is also very fast, because the original notebook is Ibm, so it is easy to use. Be prepared to change to xp in a few days. The graphics card is integrated, but since I don't play games, it doesn't matter. I have seen many places before, and the prices are a bit more expensive than on JD.com, so I think the price is good 
0	1. Outside the room is the sound of the central air-conditioning unit. I can’t sleep 2. The hotel attendants seem to show that others owe her money, but they are very enthusiastic to those little Japan. 3. The breakfast offered by the hotel is small. , But the sanitation is very unclean. Those dishes and chopsticks are not washed at all. Four. Such hotels will no longer be free. 
0	Throughout the whole book (two volumes), from the text, to the structure, the characters, and the plot, no place is desirable. Although you have experience in the industry, you cannot write a book with a similar experience. The text needs to be expressed and refined. Very disappointed book 
0	I tried it on the same day after I bought it back, because the business trip has been useless, so I opened it yesterday and the exchange period passed. The battery cannot be recharged. I hope that the quality will be strictly controlled before leaving the factory to reduce unnecessary troubles for customers. 
0	A little regret, the hard disk in the notebook bios settings cannot directly install xp, it needs to be changed, I think many beginner players will be anxious. . . 
0	Without Bluetooth, it would be more perfect if you have one. Installing the system is a bit more troublesome. After all, this built-in system will not be used by itself. 
0	I ran through it roughly, and my colleagues also borrowed it to read it. Our feeling is that this book is rather messy and difficult to read. And the description inside is relatively rough, not very practical, and meaningless. 
0	It is troublesome to install the system, it is recommended to find a professional to install it. The desktop icons are too large and not very beautiful. 
1	It’s okay. The things in the restaurant downstairs are not expensive at all. 
0	My friend called me after staying for 2 hours and asked me to check out. She said the hotel equipment is very old and the service is not good. I did not ask for details. But you can definitely regret it if you live there. 
1	It’s convenient to live here if you work in Nanshan District. There are cars in all directions at the door, but it’s a bit noisy. 
1	The service of the hotel is good and the rooms are clean. After asking to go online, I changed a room with internet access, and the internet fee was not charged. The transportation is convenient, with Dalian Railway Station at the door. I thought it would be noisy, so I can live on the 17th floor, but I can't hear the sound at all. The cost is more than 200 yuan, which is very worthwhile. 
1	Good workmanship. The audio quality is pretty good! The heat dissipation is okay! JD.com delivers the order very quickly the first morning, and you can pick it up at noon the next day. 
1	We stayed in a room on the third floor. The room was not big (about 20 square meters), it was newly renovated and it was not bad. The biggest feature is that there are many mirrors in the room and the bathroom is all partitioned by glass. You can see everything in the bathroom from the room. The hotel is not close to the subway, but the nearby bus is very convenient. It only takes HKD5-6.2 to take 1A/9/5C through the tunnel from the hotel entrance to Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok, and take 107 to Ocean Park for more than 11 yuan. If you are returning, the bus is downstairs from the hotel. station. For shopping, the Kowloon City Plaza is next to the Kowloon Walled City Park. In addition to the Jusco Ten-Yuan Store and Baijia, there are also many private shops. Restaurants include KFC, McDonald's, and some other famous foreign restaurants in Hong Kong. Generally speaking, the hotel's price-performance ratio in Hong Kong is quite high, and it is worth living. 
1	It is cost-effective, elegant and stable, and has all the necessary functions. The best part is that the volume can be adjusted by touching and sliding. 
1	The 388 yuan B standard room is very good! Good equipment! But the shower room lacks a stand for putting things, which is not very convenient. The service is very good! Easy to go out and safe parking. LCD TV! The decoration is relatively new! But the room is relatively small! It is said that the opening time is early and cannot be changed. Facing the huge Huangshan Lake Park, environmental protection is very good! 
1	Lightweight, a notebook is actually light. This notebook removes fingerprints, these impractical functions, and is cost-effective. Memory is easy to add in, better than my previous T43. Adding memory requires removing the keyboard. The bag is also good! 
0	I just got the machine, and I turned it on several times, but it couldn’t start, and I couldn’t enter the system. I don’t know why 
1	This book and the YY book should be said to be the masterpieces of the published black back series. The story may be made up, but it vividly portrays the image of a mischievous little boy. It is true that boys are not bad and girls do not love. The spoof scenes are very heavy, and the characters use animals as the image, which matches the development of the storyline. The painter is more exquisite, and you can see that he painted with care. Very good! Worth recommending! It would be great if the quality of each of his books were based on these two books. 
1	Very good, will stay again. There is piano performance in the evening. . . 
0	It is troublesome to install XP to find a driver! And 2 1G memory is also very troublesome to upgrade! The most terrible thing is that I actually delivered the package the day after I got the goods! My heart is strongly imbalanced! 
0	I generally don't want to write reviews, but this is really the worst of the five-star hotels I have stayed in and the Renaissance brand hotel. The room is of course far-fetched. A colleague in the same industry asked me if this hotel is very old and the bathroom facilities are also very old. The equipment in Tianjin is incomparable with the Renaissance hotel I have stayed in Suzhou. In addition, I booked an executive room, and the speed of the procedures allowed me to have breakfast. It was really painful. There were four people in our group, and it took at least 15 minutes to complete the procedures alone. And the breakfast made me suspect that it was a five-star hotel breakfast. There was no freshly squeezed orange juice. The fruit was terrible. The seasonal vegetables were even more unpalatable. There was only one winter melon. I drank a cup of soy milk and a bowl of porridge. 
1	The hotel is really good, but the breakfast is a bit strange in Korean style. 
1	Small and light. . . Thank you Jingdong for the fast delivery time for these 2 shipments, and they were sent on the same day. . It’s rare, it took a long time before~ 
1	"I haven’t been here for more than a year, and I feel good about it. The old bottles have been filled with new wine. The facilities in the standard room have basically been replaced with new ones. There are smiling faces everywhere. It seems that this is really a buyer’s market. I like the staff"" Give him a perfect score for the feeling of fawning on the guests. "
0	1. The service does not have any intimacy, rigid and mechanical. We have a large family of five, one of whom is an adult and one child without ID cards, so we quarreled for 40 minutes before we moved in. Called the police station, the police said that they could not live without a certificate. We argued that after more than 3 hours driving to the place, it was a bit unreasonable not to let us live. The police said this was a rule. We said that we hoped your police would help and verify your identity with Beijing, but we were bluntly rejected. Finally, a waiter in the hotel saw that our two elderly people over 70 were too tired to check in. It was 11:30 in the evening. Let me ask: Can I still go to Chengde if I cannot open a room with 3 ID cards? 2. The room was rated as 4 stars for some reason. The quilt smells of smoke. Outdated facilities. Sound insulation is not good. The breakfast level is not good for the ten yuan at home. The waiters were not enough. I cleaned the table by myself and then sat down to eat. It took 20 minutes to check out with no people in line, and I could use 610 yuan per room for such a hotel. 3. In the list of Chengde hotels provided by Xiecheng, this hotel may be the most expensive. I thought it would be counterproductive to find a better hotel to make my parents stay happy. I hope that Xiecheng will do more inspections when signing hotels, and give more consideration to Ctrip members. 
0	It’s really unbelievable. I stayed at the hotel again a week later or I was given room 1017 (single room) the last time I stayed. Because the room was close to the air duct control system inside the hotel, the noise was too loud. I strongly requested to change the room the next day. The hotel agreed to my request and was able to sleep peacefully that night. 
1	I like it so much, the appearance is beautiful, every detail that matches the red and brown is perfect! The performance can fully meet my gaming needs. 
0	The mirror is very poor, and it was accidentally scratched. I don't know why Lenovo looks at it every day, why not change it. In addition, the sound of the booting CD-ROM drive is loud. It seems that this series has similar problems. The warranty period is only 1 year, which is a bit worried. 
1	High cost performance. Service attitude is also okay. The room is small. What's more commendable is that there are no harassing calls at night in the hotel near the train station! commendable! The breakfast is relatively simple, in general. 
1	Stayed for one night and felt pretty good. The attitude of the waiter is very welcoming, although the room is not big, it is clean and tidy. The best thing is that the location is good. It takes less than 5 minutes to walk to the Shangqing Temple Station of the airport bus. It only takes about 10 minutes to walk to Chongqing Railway Station. I especially recommend a Qiqi hot pot near the hotel, which is very cheap and good. 
0	When I got my hand to charge, the battery was very hot and the fan kept spinning. I wonder if it’s the battery problem? 
0	The hotel is very poor. Although it is listed with 4 stars, it only feels like 3 stars. The rooms are very large, but the facilities are average and the lights are too dark. The sea view room can only be seen from a distance. There is a moldy smell in the room, although not strong. Although it was January, there were mosquitoes in the room and they bit a lot of bags. The price of 440 has to add more than 13 yuan to the government tax, not including breakfast and broadband, broadband is 10 yuan an hour, 50 yuan a day, breakfast is a Cantonese morning tea order, a bit of time, it costs about 530-550, this The price is very decent four stars in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. I hope that Ctrip will find a better hotel. The local holiday prices are a bit high. Although I have never stayed, I trust the holiday brand. Can others find some better four stars? 
0	I received it only these two days, and I haven't looked at it carefully yet, and I think it's okay, but I can't find some beauty prescriptions of the author, haha! Keep watching! 
0	Although the piano paint looks good, it is too easy to leave handprints and scratches. The fan always rotates, and sometimes it rotates when the temperature is not high. Hewlett-Packard still does not bring a driver disk, it is really troublesome to install a driver. The disadvantage is that I have bought it before, or I have to spend two days studying it. 
0	The temperature is higher and the system is difficult to install. Anti-virus software is given as soon as I buy it for one day, and it drops 100 after two days. 
0	From an objective evaluation, the location of the hotel is good, but the surrounding environment is not good, and the door position is relatively biased. It feels that the hotel is not prosperous, but the business is good. It is inconvenient to take a taxi at the door. There is a big slope. When you go, you have to catch the rain. You have to run down the big slope in the rain. Walk for 2 minutes before you see the taxi! The booked is a big bed room, very small. The lighting in the room is not good. The furniture is too long and has a musty smell. The TV is small and old. But it will make money, there are three-level movies (not watched) 70 yuan. The bathroom is very small and the shower tube of the faucet is leaking. I asked someone to repair it. I was very enthusiastic. I thought I would replace a shower hose. Unexpectedly, the master was skillful and cut off the missing section. It can be used again. I’ve been in the plumbing industry, and I’m surprised.) The quilt seems to be very old. I moved in in October. It’s cold in Chongqing. I want to turn on the heating, but if it’s on, call the guest room center to check. , I was very polite in the Sichuan dialect. After the inspection, I told me that there was no heating. The indoor temperature was 19 degrees Celsius, haha! The overall feeling is that there is a big gap with a 4-star hotel, and a big gap compared to the Galaxy Hotel I have ever stayed in! The only thing that can be said to be better is: the service is okay, more enthusiastic, sincere, but not professional! Supplementary review November 1, 2007: One thing to add, the big bed is not the usual big bed in the hotel, not the 2m bed, nor the 1.8m bed, but the standard 1.5m bed (the same as the ordinary family bed). The bed is really not a big bed! 
0	The writing method is indeed novel, but it is a pity that it lacks literary attainments: the marketization of language and the entertainment of expression are ultimately difficult to pass down to the world. Nowadays, Chinese vulgar literature (not popular literature!) has prevailed over and over again, and Chinese culture is worrying! No wonder that China has been traversed for thousands of years. There is no mention of classics, and there is no one of the four masterpieces! It is a pity that the money is. 
0	"2008-01-10 The order included ""The Beauty Sutra of a 31-year-old Little Beauty"", but it was not delivered. Is it out of stock? what is this else? There is no statement on the express delivery and the receipt! Please explain. Thank you! "
0	It is too much trouble to install the system. . I pretended to be xp.. I changed n versions without success. . Finally, it was replaced with vista.. It is said that you have to brush bios... . 
1	The appearance is very dazzling, my colleagues are very envious! The performance is pretty good. From the configuration point of view, it is almost the same configuration. I haven't tried it in large online games. Because WOW has closed the server in recent days, I can't find other games that can be tested and trusted... Don't let me down, I have always trusted Sony's quality~ 
0	I have to install the system by myself. I don't have time to do it myself. I spent 30 yuan to install an XP outside. After all, I am not familiar with the use of Vista. 
0	The 15.4 screen has a low resolution of 1280*800; XP drivers are not complete, I hope Asus can produce XP drivers, the advantages of the graphics card are not obvious, not as strong as imagined, the screen is white, and the power indicator remains constant without a battery Blinking, the power adapter is too hot 
1	"I bought the book for my classmates, and I was bored on the way back to university that day, so I opened the book. The colorful pictures, some lazy words, the text has the feeling of love, the most important thing is to bring us ""outsiders"" into the world of coffee~~~~ You may not know it, but the original coffee smell is 18 There are so many kinds, the taste is bitter, sour and sweet. Each type of coffee has its own characteristics and taste...The book also teaches you how to make various coffees. If you are interested, you may wish to try it! "
0	The front desk service attitude is very bad, the overall impression is very bad. It affects the travel mood. 
1	It feels pretty good, although not new or luxurious. The sauna on the basement floor (of course it should be an independent business) cheated money and deliberately did not say that it would add room money. 
0	It was found out of the box that one of the USB ports was broken, and the left button of the touchpad was also broken. HP's quality control system can be described as rubbish. 
0	The previous comments misled me. Will not live next time. The main problems are: 1. The smell in the whole corridor is very bad, it is the kind of very damp, old smell. There is a strong smell of oily smoke from the restaurant in the elevator room. 2. The room is too small. I ordered a superior double room, but there is not much room left except for one bed. 3, 1~5 floors are shopping malls and supermarkets, the environment is very noisy. The advantage is: the bedding is white and looks very clean. It can be extended to 2 o'clock, and you only need to add 110 yuan for quick money. More humane. You can have lunch and take a break. The service attitude is better. Overall evaluation: It is a very old hotel with 1 star facilities and 2 stars service. 
1	The appearance inherits the style of IBM and the configuration is not low. The best choice under 4000. The screen is big enough to watch movies. Jingdong is more than 100 cheaper than Gome. The price advantage is great. 
0	The order day on January 6th, January 27th has not yet arrived at the local post office, Dangdang customer service (a male) has not checked, Dangdang's service is too bad! Disappointed, it seems I have to look for something else! 
1	Cost-effective, fast, Dolby sound, Bluetooth, wireless network card, high-definition camera, built-in microphone are all good. The machine is not heavy. The style is pretty. 
1	The machine looks very elegant at first glance, and the touch panel is also very novel, which makes me feel very good value. I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the screen. In this price range, it should be a relatively good value. Of course, if there is more Many consumers are familiar with a certain price advantage. . . . 
1	I can’t enter the system when I just got it and it’s useless. The hard drive is creaking, and the hard drive must be broken or something. Then I have to send it back for return, and then go to another place to get another one, hey, depressed 
0	The fan and optical drive are louder, there are too few USB ports, and there is no microphone. The overall feeling is a bit thick, which is acceptable for this price 
0	The battery of the machine is not good, there was no virtual power when it was brought in. The first time it was fully charged, it took about 1.5 hours. There is the need to change the hard disk to ide to install xp 
0	There is room for improvement in some details. The piano finish looks good, but it is too easy to get dirty. It is better to be matte. The battery is 4-cell, and the battery life is still a little shorter. 
1	"I like this book very much for the following reasons: I like the book ""Rich Dad and Poor Dad"". He taught me to recognize the real world: and the Chinese version of this book is in line with my country’s national conditions, and It also taught me how to manage money, so I like it very much. I have always liked Mr. Duan’s work, because I will come to him to participate in training, so I must understand his books. I am very interested in books about financial management. Only financial managers can live freely. I don't regret buying this book "
0	Seeing the good reviews from everyone, I also became curious about it, but after I bought it, I didn't feel any special feeling. It seems that the book is not good or not, only appropriate. 
1	The rooms are of good size and old decoration. The surrounding environment is good, very close to Bailuzhou, only a few minutes walk, and a good walk at night. The swimming pool is outdoor and the changing room facilities are average. The smell of smoke in the room is greater. 
1	Before I read this book, many times I didn't know what my husband was thinking, or why he did it and what he thought. Haha, after reading this book, I benefited from a lot of money, and I started to understand my husband slowly. This book begins with the analysis of the most basic human nature, and explains from all aspects the differences between men and women, and they are closely connected. Make women understand men in all aspects. Haha, I think this book is very suitable for people who have been married for about a year. This stage is the most difficult period for men and women to get along. 
1	When I wanted to buy this book, it was out of stock. After waiting for a long time, it finally arrived. I bought it quickly and read it. Although I read everyone’s comments before reading it, I think I might also be moved by it. I didn't shed tears, but I was sad and almost stayed up all night. What kind of love is that! It's broken! It is said that this story happened in my hometown. I read it carefully and found that it is really similar. I heard that it seems that the crew has already selected a location in my hometown to shoot a TV series. I look forward to it! 
0	The hotel is relatively old, does not meet the four-star standard, and travel is not very convenient. 
1	After going to college, I experienced the fall of love with countless girls around me, felt the sincere feelings that I was insecure but still warm to others, and I began to understand that no matter how terrible girls are, they are just the unity of angels and demons. There are too many troubles in our lives, whether it is past or not, we need to find comfort, find an outlet, pursue happiness, and achieve happiness. So having a Bible is always good, and having a Bible will always make us feel that we are not alone on the road of growth. 
1	Small and exquisite, the workmanship is very good, and the screen looks very comfortable. Bluetooth, wireless network card, etc. are available, the external battery is very thick and large, and the support time is very long, which is very good, and it is also suitable for carrying out. 
1	The battery is really powerful, and there is no problem in using it for 7 or 8 hours a day. The volume is also more appropriate. The hard disk uses the Seagate 5th generation 160G with XP system, which is quite fast. Bluetooth is very convenient, and it also supports 802.11N WIFI. The speed is really good. 
0	The smell is too heavy and I can’t sleep at night. I hope that Handan Hotel is a bit ethical and will start business just after the decoration. I want to poison people! 
0	"Reading the introduction of this book was originally good, so I bought a set for my child. I hoped that my child could become more imaginative and brave after reading it, but I told the child ""I Can Beat the Monster"" After that, the child changed from being brave to being timid. He didn't dare to be in the house at night. He had to be accompanied by his father or mother to be in the house. I took the book from the bedroom to another room and lied to him to throw it away. After that, I became less timid. "
0	"Yu Dan turned a blind eye to the many dregs in ""The Analects"" and touted it as a guide to life, but he had to admit that the good side had some truth. "
0	There is a problem with the keyboard's installation, some are looser and some are tighter, which is the most unsatisfactory place. In addition, surface A can collect fingerprints and scratches easily. The machine is still a bit thicker and heavier, even for the sake of the battery. Linux is a bit laborious to install xp back. 
1	The price is good, and the keyboard is more comfortable. The screen's realistic effect is very good, small and light. The built-in video software is easier to use. 
0	It would be better if the price could be lower! Jingdong should do more special offers! Express service attitude is not very good 
0	Follow the driver download address provided by HP customer service to download and install, and finally there are a lot of unknown devices! After two days, I couldn’t figure it out. In the end I could only ask a friend for help. 
1	The room condition is quite good, basically the same as the 5-star hotel I stayed in Nanjing. The service attitude and hotel environment are quite satisfactory. The only problem is that it took nearly 40 minutes to check the room when checking out. I don’t know what they checked. For so long 
0	I ordered three books, but only sent me two! ! ! This one is missing! ! Really don't understand! ! Obviously the order was successfully placed on the order, but one was missing! ! Helpless! ! ! Need to improve the system! ! Thank you! ! 
1	"Before I bought it, I saw one of the books called ""I want to go to see the sea"". This sentence my baby also told us when he was 2 and a half years old. He drove to watch the sea during the National Day last year, fulfilling his dream . So when you see the title of the book, you have an urge to see how Carmela realizes his little dream? When telling the baby about this set of books, he was very involved and was deeply attracted by the adventurous, brave, strong and optimistic character of Carmela and her children. As a result, for the next few days, every night, he would always pull out this set of books and let me tell them over and over again, even though I had already talked about dry mouth... "
0	The machine is equipped with 1G memory as standard, but it comes with the VISTA system. When there is no 1G memory loaded with gifts, the system obviously feels very slow and it runs hard. It should be equipped with 2G memory as standard. 
0	"Just read Mr. Nan Huaijin's ""The Analects of Confucius"" and discover how superficial Yu Dan's experience is. It feels like Nan Huaijin and Yu Dan are together like a university professor and a pupil together. "
1	The battery is powerful, but not like the legendary 9 hours, the actual estimate is about 6.5 hours; the appearance is exquisite 
0	I stayed in this five-star hotel because it is close to Kunbai, and it feels like a three-star at most. The equipment is aging, the environment is not good, and there is no room for residents such as gardens in the downtown area. The attitude of the waiter is not enthusiastic, and the front desk feels that the business is unskilled and not very polite. Waking up by a mosquito in the middle of the night. In short, it was uncomfortable to live. Not as good as the four-star Jinjiang. 
0	I got the thing in the morning. It looks the same as the other sl400 I bought before, but it is a bit slower than it. I don't know if the quality is good or not. Now I haven't found the problem. It's okay. Now I have used it for a long time and I haven't found the problem, just slower 
0	The attached CD has only the vista driver. When installing XP, go to the official website. The first time the hard disk fails to partition, it can only be installed by XP. Ghost cannot be used. The touchpad area is hot. I don't know if the hard disk is hot or the independent graphics card is hot. 
0	It comes with vista system, I don't like it very much. Without XP driver, XP cannot be installed. Also, the computer bag sent is too small. 
0	I don’t know how to do the heat dissipation on the D side. It’s faint, but fortunately, the temperature of the CPU, hard disk, etc. is OK. In addition to the main heat dissipation, the other heat sinks are not copper. 
1	In Sanmao's life, apart from the death of Jose, there is nothing to be sorrowful for. She is happy, but happy people often have unhappy things. That is her own psychological reason. Sanmao is very talented and really an extraordinary woman. Her footprint is beyond the reach of many people. How many people can walk so many places like her, wandering, not many people have her capital to wander, Wandering requires courage. Ye needs many other things. I am envious of her life, I am really envious, dreaming of a little bit of where she can live, to find her footprints. I believe that Sanmao is happy. 
1	This machine is equipped with a VISTA system. I don’t know why Jingdong’s customer service said that this machine only has DOS. Is it surprising us? And the drivers are also available. In general, this machine is very good, and the most important thing is very good value. This is a great value method, first sell it, and only know when you buy it. 
1	The room is very good, the breakfast is more than 100 and there is nothing to eat, the breakfast is very poor. 
0	Just 5 minutes after I received the book, I ran to give feedback. It was really fun, the book was wide and wide, and the silly cats on the cover were very funny. I didn't care to read it, hehe, I will share it with you after reading it! !!Lala 
0	I just had a child before and I read a book of Karl Witt’s education, and I felt that it was much better than this book. I turned it over and threw it aside. 
0	Fever is common, but from the 6515b that I started to use in 2007, this heat did not cause any problems. You should not use your hands to touch it when it does not exist, unless you want to boil eggs, haha 
1	The appearance is much better than the silver gray ASUS of the classmates, FREE DOS, in fact, for most random VISTAs now, it is better to install the system by yourself, avoiding some unnecessary troubles 
1	The appearance and interior are good. The price is relatively high. The heat dissipation is good. The speed and service of JD delivery are top-notch. 
1	"Just started reading ""Peter Lynch's Successful Investment"" and was shocked by Peter's lifestyle. Observing the world with the eyes of ""Is this a listed company?"", analyzing the company's fundamentals in the various items that we come into contact with every day, and thinking about whether we can invest in the company when we see prosperous products. A wonderful life! I couldn't help but think of Qingqi's idea of constantly exploring money-making opportunities outside of work in ""Rich Dad"". Seeing the world from an investment perspective, how wonderful it should be~~ "
0	"Suddenly I found that everyone was holding a copy of ""Those Things in the Ming Dynasty"" before realizing that it turned out to be 4, and I quickly bought a copy from Dangdang. It feels so-so, I can't go on seeing half of it. "
1	Mainly for the serial port, my friend installed the dongle to use, I only found this, and it feels much better than I expected. Dell’s Bios has many settings, especially SATA can be set to ATA mode. It is much more convenient to install XP. The XP driver on the website is also complete, and a driver CD is also included. It’s much better than the other big-brand notebook I installed for my colleagues before. The bios is basically waste and there is no random driver. There is only Vista driver on the website. I only get the driver when I contact customer service for a long time. I also integrated an XP with SATA driver. It took a lot of effort to install the installation disk. 
0	I bought a 31-year-old little beautiful woman's Beauty Sutra. When I read it, I found that there are dozens of traces drawn with a pen in the second half of the book, which makes people look uncomfortable. How can I solve it? 
1	"After reading this book ""Big Cat's TT Fighting History"", I also recommended it to my girlfriend to read it again. It may be more rewarding to read these books in a pastime. Nowadays, women seem to be working harder. We are all with Tan Bin is sitting in different cubicles and experiencing similar or similar things. Is it necessary to live a peaceful life, earn a living ration, or find a place in the workplace, looking for the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction possible It's a multiple choice question for women in the workplace. If you know what you want, you should probably know how to do it, go and live! "
1	Although he is not seen, but because he believes in him, there is an indescribable and glorious joy. In a lecture last weekend, a well-known children’s writer said with regret that neither adults nor children believe in fairy tales anymore. In fact, more than fairy tales, we don't believe many things now. After reading this book, some people may find it unreliable. However, the only way we can't believe is to try to believe. 
1	The price is not bad, the configuration is not bad, the appearance is very fond, and the standby time is 2 hours! The only thing I like is that the screen is LED, 
0	After reinstalling the system, the face recognition at boot is gone. You can only see the photographed avatar in msn, and you can’t see the others. I can’t find the location of the camera. Should I install other software? 
0	The C drive is too big, but you can download the software AcronisDiskDirector10.rar from the Internet to adjust the partition. The nominal 320G, but I only saw 298G (C 288 + D 10), but I didn’t see the others. 
1	Toshiba has entered China many years ago. This notebook is very good in terms of weight, workmanship, screen and tone. 
1	My son is one year old and eight months old. Children have always loved listening to me telling him children’s songs. But I usually say that he listens, and at most it is the action of clapping hands. In this book, every ballad has finger movements. When I told him the first ballad, I made finger gestures with him as I said it, haha, he was smiling so happily! ! However, the finger movements of some songs did not cause my son to laugh. In general, as long as there are parts that can make children so happy, I think it is enough. How can all parts resonate with children? ! 
1	The hotel has convenient transportation and a good environment. It happens to be next to our office. I feel that the price/performance ratio is OK. I will consider staying at this hotel in the future. 
1	This book was originally for my daughter, but then the whole family was interested in reading it and rushed to read it. Very interesting. 
1	After reading it, I even had the urge to raise it exactly as in the book! It's really worth recommending. I thought my child was 13 years old and was not suitable for watching. In fact, at every stage, I can find what I need to improve and remedy. Through the author's own careful observation in education, we can see what kind of results our incorrect expressions or practices will bring to our children in the future, which is very reasonable and makes us avoid many detours. I like this book very much and I bought a few more for my friends. 
1	The room is relatively spacious, and the lobby is far from the 5-star hotel. The elevator is fast, especially to the upper floors. 
1	The rooms are small but well equipped. The service is very good and I have been staying at this hotel. 
0	The keyboard is not working, the most important thing is that after installing the sound card driver, the computer still cannot find the sound card! White screen 
1	1. The configuration is relatively balanced and the weight is relatively sufficient. 2. Basically meet the family's Internet needs 3. The JD pick-up point is very close to my home, only 200m. 
1	Never heard of it before, a famous Spanish poet recommended by a friend. The level of the translator is beyond doubt, the old translator is in place, and the text is compact. Lorca’s poems have a lot to do with Spanish music. You can see from his life that there are many musical elements and images in the poems. In short, if you like poetry, it is worth reading, and this edition is not expensive after discount, the book is quite thick, the verse itself is very short, the large piece is blank, it is a bit extravagant, haha~~The printing is quite satisfactory, not fancy~~ 
0	I went to live on the first day of National Day, and the retail price was the same as that of Ctrip. The deluxe room was 672 yuan without breakfast. The room facilities are quite old and I feel very average. 
1	In order to satisfy his appetite, the little monster ate all the darkness, which made all animals and everyone confused, while the little monster was not satisfied, but became more lonely. Until he gave his love, although he became smaller again, everyone and animals including him became content and serene. Jimmy's paintings are beautiful, and the content of the story is even more profound. The son is three years old. He has already liked this book very much when he first came into contact with him, and his fear of darkness has diminished. Believing in this book will give him more feelings when he is an adult. 
1	"Just after reading the beginning, I put the purple bracelet on my wrist, and I am determined to invite more people to join, for that sentence ""change the consciousness of the earth""...many people fantasize about the future of the earth. It’s been destroyed by human beings and it’s very unpretentious, even if you go to read the composition of elementary school students... I think if we start from me and change our consciousness, when our consciousness is filled with more love and harmony At that time, the future earth will definitely become our ideal home! "
1	The price of things is pretty good! Now that XP is installed, can anyone tell me where to download the driver for Bluetooth and other control keys on the keyboard? I can't use a few of them. 
0	Yu Dan's eloquence is outstanding, and his writing is fashionable but superficial. Although I can't understand the real Analects, I don't believe that the original intention of the old sage is so superficial! 
0	I saw it in a bookstore before. It was about the size of A4 paper, but when I got it, it was only half the size, and I didn't feel that way at all. The baby doesn't like it. 
1	I lived there when I went to Jiuzhaigou in October last year and I felt great! I went with a colleague again this year and felt that the service was poor. Feedback from the hotel May 27, 2008: We hope that guests will provide valuable comments and suggestions on our services. We are happy to accept criticisms from our guests. 
0	Although Dangdang is very cheap, the original price is 23.80. I bought it back for more than 10 yuan, but many pages are missing, please review Dangdang or the Chinese Social Science Publishing House. 
1	Furong Leading Hotel's room rate is more affordable than other four-star hotels in Chengdu. The executive floor is upgraded and the room is very large. Everything is available, impeccable. It is very cultural and it is very close to Wenshufang. The details in the room are well considered, giving a very warm feeling, not bad! Hotel feedback June 13, 2008: Dear guest: Hello! Thank you for your attention and support to our hotel, and we look forward to your visit again. Wish you the best at work! 
1	Small and exquisite in workmanship. The solid state drive is very good value, of course, this was when I bought it at 2999. 
1	After installing XP, it seems that the proper driver is not installed, so it’s horrible to play Warcraft. When you play ASUS after-sales service, there is no official driver for XP. Most of them are drivers under VISTA. I saw many friends. The installation of XP is very successful, so I eagerly hope that friends who use the S97V notebook will share the drivers under XP. Generally speaking, good 
1	Samsung’s selling this price is considered cheap, as a supplement to the machine, the trade-off between msi and this model is the final choice 
1	This book can't let you ride the business and stock markets, but it can let you know a panoramic view of Buffett. For the first time, this character was brought to life in front of readers. Here he is not the aura of stocks and investment masters. But an ordinary person of flesh and blood, he reads ordinary stories like your friend is around, and feels the journey of life he has experienced. It is very good to recommend to everyone, I feel that when I grow up with Warren! Here he faded his halo, letting readers understand like ordinary people! I want to thank the author for showing you a panoramic view of Buffett! 
0	It is very difficult to install XP system, you can use Deepin SP3 6.2 version, I can't turn off SATA devices in the 9.0 version of OK BIOS, so when installing XP, you need to integrate the SATA driver. 
0	"The local reputation is quite high. Taxi drivers know that there is a civil aviation sign on the top of the building; the hotel facilities are a bit old. After checking in for an hour, I felt that there was no warmth in the room. I tried the heater with my hand and found There was no heat, so I wanted to contact the reception, but after searching for a long time in the room, except for the massage center phone in a prominent location, I couldn't find the phone between the reception and guest room center, so I had to go downstairs. Fortunately, I ran into a room attendant in the elevator. Soon after returning to the room, the waiter called and said that the pipe was aging and was changing rooms, so he moved with his luggage. The facilities in the room are also very old, there is a bathtub, the shower is very comfortable, the towels are very old and there are holes. The breakfast has all kinds of dishes, which feels cold and eats very little. Because it's a 3 o'clock in the afternoon, discuss with the main station whether you can check out one hour late, and the little girl from the main station can't tell the truth! Although I always felt that the room was not hot enough after changing the room, I had to wear a thick sweater, so I added a quilt when I went to bed the next day. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt strange. I went to try the radiator and it was cold. of. I can only put on my coat and get down to the reception at 3 in the middle of the night. The girl at the reception immediately called a young man, who was wearing a police uniform. The little girl told the young man that there was another one called cold. Then he said to me, the window of the room you live in is already cold enough, so I'll change your room to another room that is as cold. Asked if I could change a room with a smaller window, the waiter said with a smile, not asking for the price. When you change rooms so casually, when you book a room, Xiecheng doesn't say that the room is tight, and it is not allowed to book without a credit card guarantee. Later, notice that the occupancy rate is extremely low. There is no other way but to change rooms, so I packed up all my luggage in the middle of the night, first went to the reception desk to change the room card, and then went to the new room. The waiter always looked at with a strange face, without any sign of regret, maybe on night shift It's also boring, and finally a little fun. When I arrived in the new room, it was still cold. I found that there was a call from the guest room center in the corridor. The waiter said that the hotel had turned off the heating in the middle of the night and said that besides the quilt, there were spare blankets to cover. Gosh! After waking up the next day, I felt that my stomach and intestines were freezing bad, groaning and diarrhea. When I checked out at noon, there was a billboard for the massage center in the most prominent position of the main station. The walls were hung with signs such as ""Four-star Hotel"", ""Youth Civilization Number"", and ""Excellent Service Unit in Jilin Province"". I could not help but sigh. This must be a state-owned hotel under the civil aviation system, so the sense of service is basically still in the Cultural Revolution era of ""rewarding you in an unaccompanied homeland, and you should be grateful."" For state-owned hotels, the National Tourism Administration has always had 1 to 2 stars of water. "
1	There are everything that should be there. With such a good configuration at this price, it is about to catch up with the price-performance ratio of many third-tier brands. The quality of Asus products is guaranteed. Very suitable for students. 
1	"Little Beaver's book son liked it very much when he saw it. I put it on the table next to the sofa at noon that day, thinking that my son would find a ""gift"" after school. Sure enough, he saw it, and read several books in one go (he told me excitedly on the phone and thanked me). In the next few days, he saw for himself and sometimes asked his father or me to tell him. We sometimes ask him to tell us. Very happy time. He even asked to take this set of books with him even when he went to play at his little brother's house on the weekend. . . . . "
0	The room is acceptable at this price and the bathroom is huge! But the soundproofing is very poor and you can hear everything. The worst is the breakfast, which is simply horrible. All the tableware is made of plastic. The white plastic tableware has turned black because it has been used for a long time and has not been washed for a long time. Part of the plastic tableware is attached to some unknown unwashed objects, dripping with water (and even water in the bowl), I don’t know if it’s been washed or soaked in water and taken out, used to eat porridge. Flies flying in the sky, steamed buns and buns are cold. Dirty, dirty, too dirty! I can ask for a very simple breakfast or even white porridge with water, but I absolutely cannot tolerate dirty. The price says it includes breakfast, but it can be regarded as including breakfast. Anyway, I dare not eat it. Hotel Feedback May 21, 2008: Thank you very much for your valuable comments to our hotel. In response to this situation, our company will propose a rectification plan. Our aim is to satisfy the guests, and we will continue to work hard for this. Thank you! Hope that next time you stay will give you a different feeling! ! 
1	In order to achieve those enviable possessions, and to distinguish the differences from each other, I forgot to be who I am. Perhaps it is because of too much inertia and common sense that I am more lonely. This set of books is very good, but unfortunately I have not been able to buy it. All, the other copies of it have not been bought so far: I love you as you are, what you need, you are special... You are special, you don’t need to have the so-called achievements, talents, or character, but you Originally it is special. I am unique in this universe. No one can replace it. The dream is in my hands. I can. 
0	1. It's been a long time since I came back to install the system; 2. The memory is still a bit stingy, although it is enough, but it must be upgraded anyway; 3. The price has dropped a bit quickly, now it is 3799, just a few days after buying it ! 4. A bit heavier. 
0	We all know that many things don’t need to be so cumbersome. It seems to be promoting yourself to clear yourself of suspicion of public opinion. I don’t think it’s really a success. Many content in the book. It is estimated that this book was planned and definitely not completely completed by the author. Some of the content is still very fake. This kind of publicity is really too much. It is not recommended to buy it. It is boring. 
0	Are the quality you bought? It’s incredible. After I bought it, the first impression I felt was that the packaging was too bad. The CD cobbled in the carton and it was easy to rub. I tried it. There were 10 discs in total, and 7 of them couldn’t be read. It's really cheap and not good. It is recommended to be careful if you want to buy it. The quality is not as good as the pirated version. It should be a bad pirated version. 
0	Before coming to Changchun, I checked many hotel ratings of Ctrip. I felt that this was pretty good, but I felt disappointed after checking in: 1. The door of the room was broken; 2. The air conditioner was not good; 3. The room was old; 4. The service was average. . . . All in all, the price/performance ratio is very low, and the breakfast is not bad. 
1	I got the computer and installed the memory stick by myself. This is pretty and stable, the keyboard is very comfortable, the camera is very clear, and the mouse is very beautiful. 
0	The front desk service is very poor, there is no basic smile, I don't even look at you, not even the guest house, it is obvious that the four-star brand is bought back. The decoration of the room is also very general. Fortunately, the price is not very high, but the service is high. Stayed twice, there is no sign of improvement, I won't live it next time! 
1	1. The price is low. 2. The mold is acceptable, not very low-grade. 3. The configuration is relatively balanced, Pentium dual-core, burn CD-ROM drive. 
0	There is a port on the right wrist, which looks like a card reader expansion port, without a cover, and it is ugly. The workmanship is so-so, and when I hug my body and use it, my wrists hurt, mainly because the corners are too sharp. 
1	I bought it for its long standby time. I haven't tested the actual use time yet, and the keyboard feels good. 
0	The appearance size is too large, a bit like a 13-inch notebook mold, and the piano lacquer shell is easy to scratch. And it dropped by 100 just a week after buying it. 
1	"The sea view is a big selling point, but the room size is small, not close to the subway station, and the taxi to the airport is 360 Hong Kong dollars. The service is not bad, the doorman is amiable, of course, if you give a tip, it will make you feel like an emperor. The ""Grandpa"" who greets the ""Taxi"" has been dressed up like ""Red Head San"" for several years. Is it creative or not? But honestly he is quite dedicated! It is estimated to be 10-15 minutes to walk to the subway (but I haven't walked seriously, probably nothing). You can go to the “Haidu Restaurant” on the third floor of the new Hongji to drink tea. It is said that Premier Zhu Rongji has also eaten (as mentioned at the service desk downstairs)! "
1	The reception staff of the hotel are still very enthusiastic, but the food in the restaurant is too unpalatable and the service is very good. I knew that we were going to Jiuquan early in the morning. It was obviously that I lived there for 2 days, and an additional room was opened the next day. However, it only reflects one room per day, and the staff of Ctrip made N times to check the phone. It is really small and big! The feeling of this hotel in my heart is very bad. Don't live in the street, the window glass is not soundproof. 
1	1. The attitude and consciousness of the service staff are very good; 2. The breakfast has many varieties and good taste; 3. The next time I go to Taiyuan, I will stay at this hotel. 
0	It’s not a classic scrub. It’s a pity. I believe that with a classic scrub, there will be more fans 
0	I have always introduced customers to this hotel apartment. Due to its convenient location and close to Suzhou Paradise, the environment is better, and it feels like home. I am generally satisfied. Until recently I encountered some problems, which made me wonder if my judgment was wrong. The question was raised by the CEO of the foreign headquarters. The room was unable to access the Internet. On the first night, because he had to send a document to Canada before 12 o’clock, he had to return to his room to work early after dinner, but he couldn’t access the Internet and had to call to communicate. Explain, busy till late at night. I came back the next day and asked about the password and operation of the Internet. The front desk flipped through the account book for a long time and printed out a description of the size of A4 paper. After a brief look, I found that it is necessary to establish a connection and set up a computer. The steps are extremely complicated. I have to worry about the operation not coming. On the third day, the boss told me listlessly that he still couldn't connect to the Internet. And, tell me not to book here again next time. I feel that under such circumstances, it is really shameless. When checking out, the hotel explained that some rooms can be directly connected to the Internet, and some need to be set manually. I am really helpless, can't I explain it in advance? Especially for foreigners, the computer is in Italian, and you need to understand the computer and the language to set it up, so you can’t help but ask for trouble and arrange a room with direct access to the Internet? It is recommended to establish a WIFI connection early to completely solve this problem. Of course, there are other reasons why he does not want to live here. He is very dissatisfied with having to swipe his card to bet a day’s room fee when checking in. He said that he has been to many countries, but there are hotels in China (of course not all hotels, Some only bet a card number) to do this, because doing so is a great distrust of personality. In developed countries, you will never ask to swipe your card or deposit cash when you check in, and it is far more than the price of the price. Although I explained that this is a custom, whether it is the same for Chinese or foreigners, and it is by no means discriminatory against foreigners, I still feel very uncomfortable psychologically because of our backward concept or credit. Due to work needs, when the hotel requested to extend the stay for one day, the hotel again asked to make up the difference. This time only one day’s room rate was requested. Perhaps our dissatisfaction had put too much pressure on the hotel staff. He finally said that it is not necessary to use it. At that time, I really got angry. Are the rules set and enforced at will? You can brush it or not, what is this? ? ? The cards were taken out, and they were taken back in this way. I was afraid that the boss's anger would be aroused again, so he swiped another 500. At the checkout, the problem came again. There were two signings in his hand. Because the cost was more than 3 yuan for the first signing, I was asked to swipe 1500 again. The explanation was that the consumption could not exceed the authorization. The remaining 3 yuan was swiped from another authorization. Or you can give 3 yuan in cash. Looking at the 1500 yuan authorization, 500 authorization and 1500 consumption, 3 yuan consumption, the foreigner is almost desperate. I really don't understand how such a simple thing is made so complicated. All he can do is to stop asking for trouble next time. 
0	Because I followed my mother to read these health care books, there are also several books in the series about seeking medical advice, but the evaluation of this book can only be said to be average. But reading will always find something useful, and there are a few methods in the book that are still practical. 
0	The sound is not good, but Altec Lansing is said to be the best notebook; I mainly use it to process a large amount of chart data, and it seems that the data processing is not fast, I don’t know what it is related to; With the bag and power supply, girls still carry it Heavy, consider portability, netbook is better. 
1	I think the hotel is very good, the rooms are very clean, and some bathroom facilities are also good, I thought very thoughtful. It is a good hotel, and the price is acceptable through Ctrip. I would recommend friends to stay. 
0	I booked a two-day hot spring standard room with my wife during the Lunar New Year, and finally left after staying for one day. The reason is that the room feels relatively unclean, the bathroom equipment is relatively simple, the front desk management is very chaotic, and I can understand the large number of people staying at the check-in, so When I checked out, there was a problem with the only credit card machine at the front desk, which prevented me from canceling the deposit made with my credit card, which made me wait for an hour. I attach great importance to the quality of service. The only good thing about this hotel is the good room service. The waiter is very polite, but unfortunately I never consider staying again... 
1	The advantages of this hotel: cheap, beautiful sea view, convenient to Ocean Park, there is an air-conditioned bus to the park entrance not far downstairs, and the card is only 6 yuan, which is a few yuan cheaper than the bus from Admiralty to Ocean Park. The hotel staff is very nice (the porter sent the luggage to the room and forgot to pay for it. After he left politely, we only remembered that Hong Kong has a habit of paying for consumption o(∩_∩)o... Going downstairs to find a place to eat, I ran into the doorman again, and he was very polite and polite and patiently explained how to go, and what places to eat nearby. Also, we heard that we should stay for 10 when we go out every day RMB as a tip for the cleaning aunt. But when we come back, the 10 RMB is still on the table) Disadvantages: a bit old (the room is small, so we don’t care about it o(∩_∩)o... The decoration facilities and style are quite different from Disney hotels, but the room price is also half the price o(∩_∩)o... It is not very convenient to travel, although there are buses to various places. , But the bus in Hong Kong does not report the stop. We were dizzy in the car and didn't know where we were. The next day I had to take a taxi to the subway station (but the starting price can get to the subway station). In Hong Kong, only taking the subway is the most secure and knowing where you are. After several stops on the bus, you can remember it, oh! It should have just arrived~ Khan~ So next time I go to Hong Kong, I might choose to stay in a hotel next to the subway. 
1	"Although this is a book published in 2005, some of its articles still have value worth thinking about today. In particular, ""Global Aging and China's Response"", ""Unreasonable System Design That Causes Poverty of Peasants"", ""The Breath of Life: The Moan and Dawn of China's Rural Medical and Health Care"", etc., which were proposed several years ago on rural areas Issues, environmental issues, and the aging of the population, and so on, so that today we can compare the development or stagnation or regression in the past two years, and pay more attention and thinking. "
1	The configuration is reasonable and there is no obvious chicken ribs. The heat dissipation and workmanship are good. The keyboard design is the highlight. The gifts are also more practical. The good price-performance ratio at this price is really not much. 
1	A good choice for a business trip to Liuzhou, especially the business room, the night view of the north-facing room is good. Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: Thank you very much for your long-term support and concern for our hotel. Our south-facing river view rooms are also very good. In addition, the high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, will soon be completed, looking forward to your visit! ! 
0	The built-in Hynix memory is not very good, and the motherboard is not very good. It cannot run smoothly after installing VISTA, so I can’t buy 4G memory again. 
1	There are many people who read very little but do business very well. I think it is a sense of business and a desire for wealth. So reading textbooks may not be able to learn the real things. Those successful experiences are the most precious. They have their own paths and are not necessarily very standardized, but they all lead to success in the end. I hate textbooks. Those things are cold. There is no vitality at all. The really good things are like this book. They are wonderful and excite you. It is our guide to starting a business. Especially for a successful company like 7-Eleven that started from a small age, it is better for me. Practical significance. 
0	The main station is cold and the hotel is deserted. The price is not high, the price is too expensive, it is better to live in Jiali. 
0	Still a bit thick. Without the original mouse and original bag, these two are very important and can effectively facilitate the purchaser. Otherwise, you have to buy it separately. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful, especially suitable for girls. I bought pink for my wife. She liked it after reading it. The money for a mobile phone is a good value for me!!! 
0	I arrived at the hotel at 7:30 in the morning. I had to wait for 12 to check in, but the front desk said that we could enter the room in advance. I had a good impression. But when I entered the room, the central air conditioner was not air-conditioned, and negotiated that it would be there at 12 noon. After playing well in the afternoon, I came back at 5:30, and there was still no air-conditioning. After negotiations, I changed to the maintenance of the computer room, which would be at 7 in the evening. Complain to Ctrip. After a meeting, the hotel replied that the circuit would trip at night, so the central air-conditioning is not turned on at present, it may be at 7 or 8 o'clock. Repeated words, not sure, annoying, or a three-star hotel. I ordered the fragrant duck soup at the restaurant in the evening, but it turned out to be chicken soup. The waiter confidently said that what you ordered was chicken soup. When you asked for the list, the waiter smeared out the word fragrant duck and wrote pheasant. . . . The service level of faint is still 3 stars, it is the worst service of all the hotels I have stayed in, and it is far away from the scenic spot and the traffic is very inconvenient 
0	A few days ago, Shanxi traveled to Datong and booked this hotel by phone. I feel very upset overall. The room was just up to the three-star standard, but it was reported as a four-star; after moving in, it felt like a bathing center, and the room was not soundproof and messy. The next day, the checkout was done internally and the items in the room were damaged. I went up and said that I checked it wrong. I really don’t know what to do. Next time, please pay attention to hotel taste when recommended by Ctrip. Don't smash the signs. 
0	It was not possible to provide the room requested according to the reservation. Obviously, it was required to have two double-bed rooms. After the arrival of the day, it was informed that there was no room. And only one standard room was given. At first, even the air-conditioning was broken. The high temperature of 40 degrees in Beijing, no Know if this is a hotel or a sauna 
1	Nice hotel, breakfast is also ok, and if you book with Ctrip, there will be gifts and greetings. The newly decorated hotel is all good, and there are rose petals in the toilet. . Ha ha ha ha 
0	Piano paint, the whole fingerprint collector. Heavier than expected. With the two USB ports on the right, my wireless mouse’s transceiver is difficult to plug and unplug, but it’s smooth on the left. It is estimated that the two on the right are too tight. 
1	The original appearance of the Old Summer Palace, do you still remember someone looking for it? I don’t love her who has become a garden of ten thousand acres, and she is not admired. She just fell in love with the prince’s other courtyard. She likes Yinzhen. The Old Summer Palace is considered to be a love house and a good book of Wuyi. The pictures are clear and credible, and I have seen a few soup samples in the courtyard. I don’t know where Hehe's Lei family has been in the past and how far their drawings and soup samples are scattered. Suddenly it occurred to them whether they are also like a helpless child looking for the broken toys in aggrieved stubbornness in their arms. 
0	The system does not seem to be very stable. There will be a black screen for a few seconds when booting into the optical drive. There will be a squeaking sound when starting the optical drive. It is probably the reason why the optical drive has fewer screws. The delivery speed of Zhongtong is too slow. 2G memory is more appropriate 
0	What does 2--10 years old mean? I don’t think there is a book that can cover such a range. In fact, my two-year-old daughter cannot understand the content of this set of books. I tried to explain to her, but I had to describe those stories in a language that the two-year-old could understand. The content is very difficult. I guess why this book is popular in the West (written by a book review). Maybe children in the West live in a different environment from those in the East and have different educational backgrounds. They know what a farm is like, and we understand the countryside or farmhouse better. In other words, cultural differences lead to cognitive differences, so translation cannot be just a one-to-one correspondence of languages, but a leap between cultures. 
1	The heroes and heroines in the book, Jin Shanqing and Baoyi, are both more interesting people. They are a bit like the meaning of the dude making a revolution. They are very different from the revolutionaries I imagined. They are still very interesting. 
0	1. When the CPU is running at 100%, the temperature is above 80°, and the fan has some noise (acceptable), but the temperature control of the whole machine is OK, and there is almost no heat on the hand rest and keyboard. 2. The bright screen is not good and reflective. 3. The piano paint is not easy to use, it is not as good as the matte texture. 
0	When people encounter so many unchangeable painful things, how many people can really face and endure them. Even if you end your own life to escape, you need a lot of courage. Why do people live may only be able to tell themselves with their lives! 
0	To be honest, I can’t understand many plots of love in this era. I have opinions. Don’t read this kind of book after 90s. This is the sadness of an era. 
1	The overall feeling is very good, all functions are complete. It comes with a genuine Vista system, installed in the hard disk, and the hard disk has mobile protection. It can restore the system with one key or burn a recovery disc. The battery must be overcharged at the beginning, and then all used up, back and forth 3 times, after that, it can last for 100 minutes, which is ok. Overall very satisfied! 
0	The whole room is a bit too small, all the additions are about ten square meters! The sheets are dirty. 
0	I don't know if it is for environmental protection, there is no operating system CD, no driver CD. I checked many posts on the Internet before installing XP. It took a day to install the sata driver and remove all the question marks when there is no driver. I will write these tips in a while and put them in QQ space. QQ103473007 
0	First of all, I was misled by Ctrip and thought it was a four-star hotel. I didn't expect it to be a non-star (or 2-star) room among the four stars. If you indicate in advance, you will definitely not book this room. Later, it was found that the pillowcase was moldy. After complaining, the waiter said that it was not moldy, but it was not cleaned!!!!!! It was unreasonable! But it was changed. Then there is a large yellow spot on the inner side of the towel? Disgusting! Actually want to collect the next morning 
0	It may be a true portrayal of that era, but I can’t bear to see that all the money at home is spent on real estate and all the real estate is lost. Daddy here is so angry that I can’t accept this kind of life. Living should be to make life better, not Make life worse and lose interest 
1	Very good hotel, although it is not in the city center, but not far from the Bell Tower and Drum Tower, the starting price of a taxi is good, or you can take the 606 bus, the station is opposite the hotel. The hotel has a good environment, the rooms are clean, and the staff service is good. 
0	As a novel describing the emotional life of the past years, the author obviously lacks life experience and has a very average writing skills. After reading it, it feels a waste of time. It is not worth reading or recommending. The past times described by Zhang Xianliang, Liang Xiaosheng and other writers seem to be more nostalgic and emotional. This book is obviously not of a grade. 
0	The partition is unreasonable, but it can be regarded as a common problem of various manufacturers. In addition, in terms of the balance of the configuration, the graphics card is a relatively obvious shortcoming, which drags down the entire system. 
1	Good location, in the city center. Eating around is very convenient. The room is as clean as ever 
1	The author writes this article more from the perspective of Yuanyuan's mother. 90% of the examples are centered on a circle. I think that the examples are not sufficient. After all, every child is very different, and it is obvious that although the author has repeatedly emphasized the reason for education, it is undeniable that Yuanyuan’s cleverness and well-being are obvious to all. For a boy, it must not be so easy. In general, the author has cited some examples in life, which are indeed representative. The educational direction and ideas are very clear and should be studied! ! Educational notes of a good mother can be recommended to the pedantic elderly at home. 
1	The heat dissipation is good, and the texture is also good. The hardware configuration reflects an e (easy) word, which saves you. The pre-installed operating system is also free, which is very good. It saves money for consumers. It is also very good to install XP back. Just as easy to use. 
0	I saw Yu Dan on TV and admired her eloquence and thinking, so I bought this book, but I was a little disappointed. The principle of being a person and doing things in the book is very pertinent, but the connection between public opinion and language feels far-fetched. It is just a feeling in the name of the Analects. Expressing personal feelings. I regret buying it. 
0	A very small hotel. In the community, it takes about 2-3 minutes to walk to the road. The shower water in the hotel is relatively small. What is particularly unsatisfactory is that the check-out cannot be delayed until 2 o'clock. It can only be 12:30, otherwise it will be added. Friends who charge half-day room fees, eat out or take a short break at noon should pay attention. The current hotel does not have late check-out, and I have not encountered it yet. This is the first one I have encountered. 
0	"The speculation was very hot, so I bought it and watched it, but I still didn't accept it and didn't look good. It was far behind the ""Flying Dragon"" that I watched back then. "
1	The facilities are not very new but they are very clean and reassuring! The valuable camera bag that was inadvertently forgotten was discovered by the waiter in time and returned to his hands. . . Touching! The breakfast is free and delicious, and the congee, noodles are complete! 
0	It is a bit slow to run VISTA with 1G memory, so I changed it to XP, and the hidden partition is also deleted. The system sent is not backed up because I am not used to VISTA. After installing XP, go to the official download for the driver. There are multiple drivers on the same hardware official website. Make no mistake. The hotkey driver should be ATK. 
0	Located on Youyi Road Financial Street, there is no place to eat. The hotel has just been renovated, it smells a bit, I can bear it, my colleagues can't. The hotel, restaurants, bars, and Japanese cuisine are all contracted out separately by the Science and Technology Building. When I checked in, it was the first month of trial operation, and the broadband was very unstable. I called for repairs and actually used the trial operation period as a prevarication. Don't let the guests stay if it's not good. I strongly despise this. 
0	The room facilities are okay, but the hotel is very cold, not recommended in winter. 
0	At first I was quite interested, but later I felt boring. I felt that the things she was thinking about and the perspective of the problem were particularly not suitable for me. 
1	Very practical, some of the usages listed inside are basically used in actual programming work, and are commonly used. Many books like static are mentioned in the same area. This book is very detailed, because in actual work, it is often used to find data from the database and store it in an array to speed up the program. There are also some control properties, which are listed in more detail and also talked about where they are used. At first glance, the author is a person with actual combat experience. Highly recommended for beginners. 
0	It's not as good as I imagined. I thought it was a humorous and humorous book, so I could easily learn foreign languages. After reading it, I found that the content was just some common word spelling corrections, etc. It was boring. 
0	There is a musty smell in the special room, and the facade is not as beautiful as Ctrip. 
0	One of the scariest hotels I've ever stayed in in my life, comparable to hotels outside Jakarta, Indonesia (laughs)! 1. The room smelled of musty, smoke, no windows to ventilate, and the stains on the dirty carpets were shocking. 2. The toilets are dirty, stains and odors accumulated over the years make it impossible to go to the toilet. 3. The corridor is dim and dim. Please be sure to travel with a few people when you return to your room at night. 4. It has the advantage, but the attitude of the waiter is good. In short, I posted 1000 yuan and refused to stay again. 
1	On the whole it is okay, and no dead pixels are found on the screen. I have heard that installing XP is troublesome, but after setting it up, go to the computer store and ask for a dedicated backup for the installation. It will be installed in less than 30 minutes. Device drivers are hard to find. I am looking for a backup of the drivers on the Internet, and it is much easier to install. 
0	This set of books was also decided to buy because it was at the top of the list. After I bought it, I was very excited. I thought I could indulge in the world of books with my daughter for a long time. I didn't expect that a book with a boring story, I was almost bored! Personally, the author seems to misplace the story just for the drawing. The picture is very meticulous, so I don’t have to say. 
0	I don’t know what I have said. It is concluded from the case that Koreans have such logical reasoning ability. You should save money and buy some more useful books, believe me 
0	I hope that when I don’t want to buy two books, I will only send one of them when one is out of stock, and I don’t know it myself, so when I buy another one, I will have to add shipping charges. Please be smarter in your system , Don't be so stupid 
1	Big brand, workmanship is okay, it’s good to add a memory stick after buying it, one-click restore is easy to use (if you don’t know much about it, you can call thinkpad after-sales: 8009908888) 
0	The installed v system is really slow and I’m not used to it. I have a genuine XP when I arrive. I don’t know if installing genuine XP will affect the warranty. It takes a long time and is still hot. 
1	Classic machines, bought for colleagues, and used in the water industry. It is very convenient, strong, and cost-effective. 
0	Looking at both sides, the first impression is-very average. In terms of content, I really disagree. I am still known as an academic star. The opinions of Comrade Yu Dan really made me insightful! The number of pages can be compressed to 50 pages, so why waste paper? Didn’t Confucius teach you how to do environmental protection? This concludes the comment, too lazy to waste my pen and ink! 
1	Online shopping is very convenient. At the beginning, I still had some doubts about buying such valuables online. It was not until I got the notebook that it was really good. It is easy to use when the memory is large. Photoshop is turned off as soon as it is closed. No need to wait~ Haha, the delivery is also fast. I took the photo in the afternoon of the first day and delivered it in the morning the next day. The service is very good~ 
1	"Being able to have children does not mean being a parent. This may be unacceptable to many people. Many parents do a lot of things that hinder their children’s mental development under the banner of ""love children"". . I am deeply educated after reading this book. I am fortunate that I saw this book when my baby was only seven months old, instead of being seven or seventeen. It might save me many detours in educating children. Thank you very much, Teacher Yin Jianli, and hope she will write a better book. I also hope that many young parents will take a good look at this book. I have recommended this book to many friends. "
0	"Those who read her ""Analects"" and ""Zhuangzi"" think the former is good. The feeling of this book is that preparations are very hasty. "
1	Nice hotel, although it is a bit old, the Japanese side also divested. Maybe Nanjing is not a big reason at all. It is not far from the hotel to Xinjiekou and other places. The service is also very good. 
0	I bought this book together with Wolf Tuteng, but only the book Wolf Tuteng got in my hands. I also asked me to comment. ;;Too much...send the book quickly, I will not pay for the express Yes. I'm so angry. I said it last time, but I didn't help me. Please call to explain clearly. Otherwise, I won't come again. 
0	1. The piano paint is indeed inconsistent with the steady feeling of ThinkPad. And it is easy to get fingerprints. 2. This machine seems to be unable to use the SL400 Vista Ultimate system recovery disc circulating on the Internet. 3. The mirror screen has serious reflections and is a bit uncomfortable. 
0	There are only 2 usb ports, and they are all on the left side, which is somewhat inhumane! There is a big gap in the optical drive interface, it seems that the workmanship is not detailed enough to make people satisfied! But just surfing the Internet and typing and never playing games or watching movies is enough! 
0	The hard disk makes a loud noise, and a loud cocoa sound can be heard. I don’t know if you have such a problem. The machine generates more heat, and the keys in the middle of the keyboard are loose. 
1	Because of the busy work, I have not had time to write anything in the books at Dangdangbu, and I have not had time to finish reading many good books. However, I couldn’t put it down after reading Zhuang Qin’s set of Dragon’s Cave. After reading it in one breath, the author Zhuang Qin took myself His whimsical ideas are brought to the fullest in this book! I won't say much about the specific details, so readers can taste it for themselves. By the way, I would like to thank Master Li Ximin for his recommendation. All the books recommended by him are good books! Also thank Dangdang.com for giving me such an opportunity to use my stupid wisdom. Thank you! ! ! 
0	I have some doubts about the scientific nature of the content in the book, and some of the acupuncture points written in the book are not easy to find, so I personally think that the practicality is poor. 
1	The hotel environment is not bad, the price is good, I think I will live here in the future. 
0	I felt pretty good about this book, but I didn’t read a few pages before I found such a big problem. I jumped directly from page 14 to page 23. I said, it seems that the left and right pages don’t match up! I don't know who should I find to solve this problem? 
1	I forgot to see a section of it on a webpage, and I searched like crazy, and finally downloaded the electronic version of the book. I read half of it on my computer in the afternoon. I didn’t quench my thirst. I thought it should be on my bedside. The last one, so I came to Dangdang. The moment I received the book, there was a burst of joy in my heart, reluctant to read it, a little bit every day, or I finished it quickly, and then continued to order, give it to friends, and share it with them Kind of moved. The attitude towards my daughter has also changed significantly, and patience seems to have returned to me. . . I sincerely recommend this classic to you. 
1	This book needs to be tasted slowly and carefully. It is best to put yourself in the same position as the heroine in the book when you encounter problems after reading a chapter and try to change according to the methods in the book. You will find that it really works. The book that makes me feel the most beneficial is: surrender. The biggest reason why people suffer is to resist the facts. The facts themselves are neutral, and our emotions are our reaction to the facts and ourselves. An explanation of what the facts are? Fabricated? Now I have encountered things in my life that make me have negative emotions. As long as I think of surrendering to the facts, my melancholy mood can instantly relax! It is worth reading! 
0	The advantage is the location, a 10-minute walk to the Bund and Nanjing Road. The room is relatively small, and the floor is low, which is a bit depressing. The bathroom towels may be sterile, but they are very old and yellow in color. There is no way. I used my own towels. The service staff are not very enthusiastic. The girls who check in are okay. The waiter in front of the lobby basically doesn't look at me when asking for directions or answering questions. It exercises my temper and is good for self-cultivation. 
1	The address is good, located on Minzu Avenue. Since we are driving by car, it is easier to find. The room is too small and rudimentary. The restaurant on the first floor is very convenient. We had dinner there and it tasted good. 
1	A very good book, whether it is for your own mind or for the implementation of the project, it is very solid and weighty. There are more elements in mathematics. In fact, you don't need to think about how to calculate the formula. Some rigorous scholars tell you What's the process, hehe, why don't you trust that they will not fool you under the guise of mathematics? There are too many applications, but people are actually impetuous. When I read the first page, I hold my heart and let the author tell you how to trick you I looked in the equipment and found that the author originally expected the reader to practice personally. I have been taught, teacher. 
1	The location is good, very close to the airport bus stop, eating around is very convenient, there is a good and cheap hot pot. 
1	The screen and workmanship can be made at a fair price. The rainforest wind system installed with pe has some problems when booting. There are drivers and programs in the CD-ROM. Just install the shortcut keys and you can use it. 
0	The content of the book is good, but the reprint printing is not as good as before. I bought a set at Xinhua Bookstore before, and then I gave it to someone. I heard that Dangdang will have a discount, so I ordered another set. I found that the version supported by Dangdang.com’s marketing is obviously not high in print quality, low in image definition, and paper. Not as good as the version sold in the bookstore, I don’t know why? Is the price discounted and the quality discounted too? 
1	"Personally, I think it’s better than ""The Tragedy of Y"". Although Y is also very classic, I personally feel that this book is very reasoning. Among all the mystery novels I have read, this book is the most in line with the classic reasoning, because it often The reasoning part of many mystery books is not very large or very important. Some things focus on the plot, and some focus on the investigation of the process of solving the case. Of course this is also very good, but it can focus on tension like this ""The Tragedy of X"" There are not many plots with classic reasoning! classic! "
1	The room is small, a bit like a guest house.............Four stars............... 
1	There are Hongkou Hotel and Hongkou Business Hotel next to Yantai Hongkou Hotel. Hongkou Hotel is the best among the three. I stayed in the Hongkou Hotel Facing Sea Standard Room (400), and there are two sea facing business hotels. Room (430), clean, nice scenery, facing the sea. The fly in the ointment is that it seems to have just been renovated (a bag of bamboo charcoal in the room is proof), the taste is relatively big. The overall feeling is quite satisfactory. 
0	Most women want to meet a man who loves them infatuatedly, no matter how they treat him, he will not leave. . . I think this is just YY. Why can the selfish, radical and always suspicious heroine treat the actor as he pleases, and the actor still loves her so much? I can only say that there is no reason for love, a bit silly~@~ 
0	The hotel rooms are well decorated and the space is very large, but what I can't understand is that the rooms of more than 300 nights do not provide free internet access. In addition, the pillow towel is not clean, to be honest, I will not consider living next time. 
1	The installation of XP is very convenient. It is much more convenient than the previous Asus. I searched it online for a long time last time! 
1	Always thinkpad series, the stability of the system is better, the heat dissipation is also done well, and the VISTA interface is very beautiful. 
0	Without the system CD, the shiny shell is too easy to get dirty, and there is a bright spot on the screen, but it is relatively close 
0	What book? I don’t like it. I don’t understand why I have to die. If the death of the son is understandable, the death of the daughter is far-fetched. In the end, the death of the son-in-law and grandson is simply incredible. All the relatives left one by one. Does it make sense to live like this? 
1	Hehe, you get what you pay for, the company uses it, and the company's books are divided into different categories. These are originally for newcomers, and the configuration is similar. 
1	The configuration and appearance are good, except for Bluetooth, there are other things, and there is no useless vista home edition pre-installed, saving hundreds of OEM system costs; I bought a 2g ddr2 800 Kingston memory and plugged in, compatibility Not bad 
1	Be sure to read a little good book every day, it will be beneficial to memorize it for a month. 
0	The location of the hotel is a bit more than stated in the address description, close to the outskirts of the city, not even a clear sign on the roadside, disappointed. The appearance of the hotel is decent, but the lobby is very mediocre (a bit like the lobby of a hotel), and the decoration of the corridors and rooms are relatively old, far from the pictures released by Ctrip. Toiletries are poorly equipped, probably at the level of Samsung. At the same price, it is much worse than the Guangzhou Royal International Hotel near the Tianhe Shopping Center where you used to live, in terms of decoration, service, and even buffet breakfast. When I made a reservation, I couldn't remember the specific name of the Royal International Hotel, so I booked this hotel. I really regret it. I won’t choose here again when I go to Guangzhou, never~~ 
1	After getting it, my six-year-old daughter asked me to read a few articles to her every night before going to bed. Later, I really liked it so much, so I just read it by myself. When I read it, I giggled when I was happy, telling me every day that she also wanted to go to Ba Academy to study elementary school. Indeed, as the Ba Academy in Japan before World War II, President Kobayashi’s true teaching in accordance with his aptitude has fully mobilized the children’s interest in learning knowledge, so that they don’t feel that learning is a chore or the pressure of exams. , There is no difference between rich and poor, this is really a paradise for children. 
1	After receipt, the packaging is intact. The notebook seal is intact. Very cost-effective, the DVD drive disk contains all necessary VISTA drivers, which is convenient. 
0	I have stayed in so many Home Inns, this one is the worst, the service is very poor, the location is also very poor, the hardware facilities are like a county guest house. The taxi driver couldn’t find the place, so he called to the main station to ask, but no one answered him. Finally, he went around a few times and found it in a small alley. When he went to the main station and asked why they didn’t answer the phone, he actually replied. Too busy. I booked a business big bed room. When I arrived at the room, I found that there were parking lots outside the windows everywhere. It was too noisy to sleep, and there was no room to change. I was depressed. . . Will never live again. Additional comments December 21, 2007: I received a call from the assistant of the general manager of this hotel today. I apologized for some of the previous things and explained some reasons. I feel that the attitude is still very good. I hope that there will be improvements in the future and better service to all customers, especially those of Ctrip. :) 
0	I don't understand why the huge Dangdang website sells pirated books. I have compared the original copy of the Book Building. The Dulala 1 I got is rough, and the handwriting is obviously lighter than the original. The pirated books that can be purchased for 8 yuan at the roadside book stalls were bought on Dangdang.com for twice the price. They were secretly delighted and recognized the quality and convenience of online book purchases. What a disappointment. 
0	The hardware facilities of this hotel are very poor, such as: the room is a KTV private room, the quilt is very thin, the breakfast is served in a simple private room (breakfast is too simple), the waiter dangling cigarettes to the restaurant to deliver breakfast, there is only one male and female in the lobby There are two bicycles in the bathroom. When I arrived at the hotel, the waiter couldn't find my order and so on. All of these are objective facts, not my fabrication. 
1	"In the Early Education Center, the teacher also told the children about this series of books, so I planned to buy a complete set, but it was always out of stock. I had to buy these 4 books first, and my son got it. I deliberately told him ""I don't cry"" first, hey, it's not bad. Whenever my son cries, I tell him the story in the book, and he stops crying immediately. I think it's worth it. It is much better than a hundred times of preaching in guiding children's behavior. Children just like animals! By the way, my son is one year old and eight months old. I think this set of books is worth reading for children! "
1	Lightweight and compact!!! The appearance is classic!!! The workmanship is fine!!! The L7700 processor seems to be outdated today. It must be the original price of 15XXX, and the current price is quite kind. 3 years of gold medal on-site service + Vista Business system , These are only available on HP models that are twice as expensive 
0	1. The partition is unreasonable 2. The built-in vista home is not practical. The above is the problem of Lenovo and it is not related to Jingdong, but I still mention it... 
1	The overall appearance is beautiful, the heat dissipation is good, and the processor speed is also good. It is easy to modify the XP system with Vista, although some functions will fail, such as facial recognition and IGRS. 
1	It was late at night after reading the book. I was shocked by the author's description of the damage caused by the war to the Afghans in the book. She was also shocked by the friendship between the protagonist and his brothers and servants, and could deeply feel the guilt in the protagonist's heart. There are many cruel scenes in the book that have been circling in my mind. I suddenly felt that growing up in China, especially after the reform and opening up, is very lucky. The climax part of the book is ups and downs, and it is thrilling to see, and also has an understanding of part of the history and disasters of Afghanistan. Plan to buy another book with three cups of tea. 
1	The overall feeling is good, the room is not big, the color is mild, the bed is soft and comfortable, just visited, the indoor temperature is quite high, the bath water will come out after a few seconds, much better than some hotels, breakfast is almost not enough, not enough for 40 yuan standard , Especially the people who make omelettes are no longer old and haven't eaten omelets for three days. Checkout is slow, there is only one person at the checkout front desk at 10 o'clock in the morning, and management needs to be strengthened. 
1	I bought it for 4399 yuan, which is more cost-effective. The heat dissipation control is ok, the workmanship is good, and it is worth the price. 
0	The rooms are ok, the facilities are simple, not like a four-star standard. The breakfast is pretty plentiful, but I have to go early. The reception, settlement speed and attitude are pretty good. The backyard parking lot is very characteristic. Two cars were scratched in one night. It’s really scary. The most important thing is that the security guards and the little boss still don’t want to admit it. 
1	Very cost-effective, it is a good choice for friends with insufficient money! However, the attitude and sense of service of JD's customer service needs to be strengthened, which is really not flattering! Fortunately, I don’t deal with them every day??? 
1	Regrettably, the Chinese translation omitted the original book Volume 1, Chapter 1, Section 4. This section introduces the calculating machines at that time. Although those machines are no longer in use, why not understand? ? I wanted to put the content of this section here, but due to the word limit, I had to give up. 
1	I read this book during a business trip in Beidaihe last year or the year before, and I read it all at once. The overall feeling is that the author has his own ideas, and he can find some points in history to support his own views and propositions, and the discussion is also relatively detailed. Objectively speaking, it provides you with a different perspective to understand the history of the Qing Dynasty. However, due to the author's reasons, there are some things that we can only reserve for the time being. After all, there are many Qing Dynasty history researchers and many opinions, and you need to identify them yourself. One problem that needs to be pointed out is that the support of viewpoints requires more historical facts than personal deliberate arrangements. arrangement. 
1	This is a book that can benefit readers quite a bit. There is no need for difficult theories, no cumbersome texts, reading pictures and explanations, full-color printing, so that readers can understand it, and learn a lot from life. We may not Pay attention to the etiquette details. Although everyone says that they don’t like superficial kung fu, the first impression of getting along with others is really important. It gives people a sense of maturity and politeness. It definitely adds points in the workplace or in social situations. Intangible things are hard to use money. To measure, but as the book says, you may get more than a million worth of etiquette. Conclusion: It is worth recommending everyone to buy and study 
0	It is thicker and heavier, I hope the SL series will be more refined in the future. Without the magnesium roll cage, the A-side feel is not very reliable. These problems make this machine less competitive compared to the same hp. 
0	I thought that the best room is that the carpet is clean. The room is quiet, soap and shower cap are available. Unfortunately, after I checked in, I found that the carpet was terribly dirty and had an unpleasant smell. I didn't know what machines in the room creaked and made it impossible to sleep. The feather box in the bathroom was empty! ! ! ! Too scary! ! ! This is the case for the most advanced rooms, so how can the standard rooms live? ? ! ! ! By the way, there is breakfast! ! The coffee is cold! ! ! The weather is the same as Qiqihar! ! ! 
0	No attached presents such as Mouse, Notebook shoulder bag, ^_^ 
0	When I first bought the laptop, I didn’t find the back cover of the laptop bulging. I guess I didn’t cover the back cover and screwed on the screws. The return is too much trouble. Time is a problem. I can bear it. Find a screwdriver. Disassemble the machine and repair it. Give this laptop these equipment such as computers. It takes a lot of effort to pack the screen film 
1	The rooms are large, well decorated and good service. . . As far as the room is concerned, it is not inferior to 5 stars and will stay 
0	Anyway, this hotel is unsatisfactory in all aspects. I have not had breakfast, so I stayed for a week without commenting. I haven’t changed the sheets and quilt. There are black dirty things on the quilt. The carpet is very dirty. The hotel smells of oily smoke. The waiter won’t even help you to flatten the quilt. It’s still crumpled. The reason why I changed from the 298 yuan room to the 228 yuan room is because I was living alone, and these two rooms are single and double. There is no difference outside the bed. The air conditioner in the hotel is not working well. It can’t be turned on. I didn’t ask the hotel about the air conditioner anymore because I didn’t have any good mid-level hotels in this city. I was very disappointed. Any development at all 
1	It feels pretty good, the room is clean and comfortable, with the prime number of a five-star hotel, and the service attitude is okay, because I think the waiter is a little cold. The worst thing is that the place is rather biased. The location of the hotel is the new city, which is pretty straightforward. It is almost the suburbs. Fortunately, Shantou is not big, and it does not take much time to get to the bustling urban areas. In addition, there is a restaurant near the hotel called Happy Seafood City, which is good. The decoration is high-grade, but the price is not expensive, the product is good, and it is recommended. 
0	The hardware of this hotel is OK, but the service is too bad. First of all, any staff in the hotel does not have due respect to the guests, and the guests can be called by them. Secondly, CHECK-IN and CHECK-OUT take more than half an hour. Strong BS Lingfang and Zuo Ruixue are inefficient and arrogant. Third, the room is extremely unclean. Fourth, there are no complaints. They will not accept your complaints and no one will say sorry to you. Fifth, the hotel is mainly for the team. , Do not like business guests sixth, room sound insulation is extremely poor, partition 
1	Very good room is very good location is very good will stay in the future 
1	"""Tom Goes to the Beach"" and ""Tom Lost"" have become my daughter's favorite. Speak every night. Called my mother, pants with pockets on both sides. When she went out, she told people she had pockets on both sides of her pants. Haha. Good book. "
0	There is no SLIC table in BIOS, OEM version of Vista is not easy to install, but there is no problem installing OEM version of XP 
0	"The last few pages of the book are actually ""double eyelids"". All the words are printed twice, so I can't read them at all. The quality of the book is really bad. "
0	I bought three books: <Seeking a doctor is worse than asking yourself>, <Don't laugh at me, I am an English vocabulary book>, and Dangdang only gave me two books. Dangdang.com from now on I have been disappointed in you!!!! I will not buy anymore!! So sad!!! 
1	Stayed many times. It feels good, the broadband speed is fast, the service attitude is good, and the price is reasonable. The main problem is that the surrounding environment of the hotel is not good, and there are too many Japanese. 
0	I booked a 198 mini cozy twin room online, opened the first room on the fourth floor, and a pungent smell of smoke burst into it. The room is small enough but not cozy. Call the service desk to request a room change and let us go to the fifth floor. When the waiter came back to open the door, no one came to open the door after 20 minutes, so I had to go to the reception desk to get the key. Fortunately, the second room does not smell of smoke, but the room is old and not as good as the average Samsung hotel. After staying for one night, I turned my head to watch the TV because it was too small to fit the table in the front. At the checkout, we actually said that we used their antibacterial towels and razors. The towel bag was torn but the front view was intact. Fortunately, we lived with two women. Why do we use razors? After more than an hour of tossing, from the waiter to the doctor, I explained that we hadn't touched it for a long time, and finally free the order. We wasted a lot of time and don't know how this hotel is managed and handed over. Except for the good receptionist attitude, I will never live in such a bad place again. When I made a reservation by phone, I told me that it was a 10-minute walk from Chunxi Road. In fact, there are two stops, and a 10-minute bus ride is almost the same. 
0	The front desk service is poor, especially the one who received me at check-in, male, round face, wearing glasses. In addition, I did not see a welcome fruit plate in the room. The level of food in the restaurant is poor. The price is expensive and the service is poor, it seems that I really can't live. 
0	I'm depressed, it's a low-end product. The first one I sent was without a tab button. The second one for replacement had a flawed appearance. 
1	Environmental services are good, except for the high price, there is nothing else to fault 
1	"My friend recommended the movie. After watching it, I always feel that the interpretation is not perfect and delicate. This has always been my understanding of movies and reading. After reading it, it is as expected. Moved by the emotion beyond common sense in the story, ""love"" once again showed her unpredictability in age. Silent meditation, there are always some dilemmas in life, why are you still so persistent? this is Love. Misha, since the encounter with Hannah, it seems that he has come for her in this life, was moved by Misha, and thanked Hannah. In this short and fragile life, why bother with the right and the wrong. "
1	The service attitude is very good. Whether it is the front desk or the logistics staff, they are very warm and courteous; work efficiency is high. Including check-in, checkout, room service, etc.; equipment maintenance is still insufficient. Such as bedside lamps that are easily overlooked Regarding aging, etc., it is recommended that the hotel can be regularly checked and repaired. When the customer feedbacks the problem, it will be a little passive. I wish Ctrip.com and Hanting Hotel do better! 
0	I have stayed at the Renaissance Nissan Hotel many times, but I feel that the service is worse than every time! As an international chain brand hotel, I actually have to check the room when I check out, and I feel that I have no trust in the customer! 
1	The basic facilities of the hotel are average, but the service attitude is really good. The rooms below the 8th floor are newly renovated, and the rooms on the 8th floor are relatively old. The bath has a separate bathroom. The water is relatively large and the air-conditioning wind is sufficient. This hotel It seems to belong to the South China Sea Fleet of the Navy. The location is also very good. It is close to the Provincial Party Committee Railway Station and only three stops away from Huangxing Pedestrian Street. It is worth staying in 
0	The surface cover of the piano paint is easy to print fingerprints, and the display and the bottom are plastic when it is connected. It is said that it is easy to loosen after a long time. 
1	Perfect metal shell, perfect keyboard feel, and the accuracy of the overall mold is commendable. A VGA interface is a must for me. The built-in Hitachi 250G hard drive claims to have a speed of 7200, 5400 heat and power consumption (5.5 w), the actual use is much faster than the 1.8-inch Toshiba disk of mini1000. 
1	The machine configuration is okay, it is completely sufficient without special requirements. The genuine Red Hat system is still quite good, although it is not commonly used, but it is good to change the taste. 
0	Everyone's views may be different. Maybe I was still outside the wall and didn't bother to read the book. I also bought it after listening to a friend's introduction. After I got it, I found it meaningless. Couples or couples have their own stories and characteristics in each family. I think it just needs to be diligent. . . . 
0	"I couldn't resist the temptation of so many good reviews from Ctrip. I didn't plan to come again, but decided to experience it again in order to decide whether to choose. Sure enough, I basically didn't disappoint me this time. The 358 yuan exquisite room I stayed last time, the 456 yuan executive suite I stayed this time, alas! You get what you pay for. Hygiene can be better-there are many black spots on the sheets. You can pay more attention to the details-why is there no time on the meal coupon? I have to call again to ask; The bathroom exhaust fan is too noisy, it feels like on an airplane; The decoration uses too much glass, which is a bit dazzling, and the bathroom should use an opaque door. In the review on November 15, 2007, I mentioned ""The King's Landing"", and then I really went to live once, and I felt that it was just three words-""very disappointed"". It was a waste of such a high building and this good name. The decoration is too Amateur, no class, poor service, I went to live on 11.18, there was no heating measures, and I didn’t tell the guests, so I left the air conditioner for the whole night and caught a cold directly. When I checked out at the front desk, I found the waiter also caught a cold. The symptoms are obvious, and I still ""stick to work with illness""-don't want to think about the feelings of the opposite customer? Just in time for the invoice to run out, I stood there waiting for the waiter to replace the new invoice for more than five minutes. There was no apologetic word from beginning to end. Additional comments February 29, 2008: Sorry, 2 points are given to ""Jun Lin Tian Xia"", give Hongyu 4.2 points. "
0	The fingerprints on the black surface are obvious, the color temperature of the screen is quite high, the color cast is quite large, and it seems that it cannot be adjusted? It seems that you can only adjust the brightness of the screen. When the AC power is not connected, the screen is dim, and the high power consumption selection does not seem to light up. 
1	I bought this thick book with a very excited mood at the beginning, and then I found out after I finished studying that, in fact, the dumb book is not as perfect as I imagined...not very detailed, there are some errors...maybe it is inevitable. ... However, there is no absolutely perfect thing in this world. Once you find something that seems perfect, it is actually a loophole everywhere. I bought this book for self-study. Now I feel that I have gained a lot. Do not regret the original choice. For learners, the real fun lies in learning itself. That's it. 
1	When I was in high school, my art teacher recommended reading books. In fact, he has a series. I'm still collecting it slowly. Because it has not been published for a long time. This book is suitable for those who have views on social issues, or if you are interested in human behavior and human development. At the beginning, what attracted me to read his book was what the teacher said in class. Why do two people with good feelings grow and look alike, even some small movements are the same? The author's book writes about this problem. In fact, many of our established actions for granted can be explained in the book. 
0	It's not a perfect screen, there is a red dot, and the paint on the front of the fuselage is a handprint when you touch it, if you send a sticker 
1	With HDMI, you can watch high-definition notebooks, fingerprint recognition and camera recognition provide security, the keyboard is more comfortable, and the Empire 3 is also smooth 
1	Beautiful workmanship. One-key recovery is convenient and easy to use, you can restore the system from CD. The system can also be restored from the hard disk. Even if you restore to a different size hard disk, there is no problem. 
1	"I watched it twice, and the symptoms in it should be very helpful to me, but the main thing is that Dean Gao’s thinking on diagnosis and treatment is the biggest gain. For example, after all, there are only a few diseases, and if you understand the idea of diagnosis and treatment, it is like using only one needle to pass the whole meridian to the unusable meridian. It feels like you can grasp any disease. ""Those who know what they want will end in a word; if they don't know what they want, there is endless dispersal."" "
1	The location of the hotel is very good, just by the city center square, it is very convenient to travel, the room conditions are also good, I should stay again next time. 
0	1. No camera, no mouse, need to be equipped separately 2. The fever is a bit big, this may be a common problem of the discrete graphics card 3. The pre-installed LINUX is worthless. When modifying the XP system, you need to change the hard disk mode to IDE in the BIOS, otherwise the blue screen 4. 16:9 screen is a bit flat, not very accustomed 
0	Without XP driver, and it is difficult to find on the Internet, the mouse touch screen driver can not be found, to use it normally, you can only use the vista system. It's troublesome. The logistics is too careless, and the delivery can leave the goods at other customers’ homes, speechless. . 
0	The display resolution is 1024*576. Many things are not displayed completely. Why not design it to 1024*600? The fan noise is relatively loud. Installing Linux on the hard disk is not as good as directly dividing the partitions and installing nothing. 
0	This hotel turned out to be a bright spot in Guangzhou, but it was so bad after I checked in yesterday. Almost everywhere I went, the experience was unpleasant!!!! 1. Check in Guangzhou Changlong Hotel on 4.6. Order placed on April 1. , The order specifically emphasized that a family room for 4 people with a view of the swimming pool and a credit card guarantee. The Ctrip staff confirmed on the second day that CONFIRM had already implemented this requirement with the hotel. It was only discovered after the 6th arrival. The family room for 4 people looks at the invincible construction site outside the window. The hotel explained: all the family rooms for 4 people look at the construction site, and there is no family room with the swimming pool at all. The feeling of being deceived is born!!!!! 2. I was asked to change to 2 deluxe rooms. During the negotiations, the hotel and Ctrip shirked each other's responsibilities and kicked me as a ball. There was no apology, and I was very disappointed. 3. After the young male staff at the front desk swiped his card to prepay I forgot to return my credit card. He didn't realize that he didn't apologize to me until the second time I changed the room at the front desk. 3. Finally agreed to modify the order, changing the original 1 family room for 4 people (1130 yuan) to 2 There are two deluxe rooms (810/room). But when I asked one of them to be a double room, the male employee refused without raising his head and said: No, there is no double room! I want my couple to enter a twin room. At this time, I really couldn’t help it, and said, you haven’t checked it yet, how can you know that it’s not, you can’t be convenient from the customer’s point of view? Another employee, Ms. Yang, just checked it out, and finally gave it. A big bed room. I just said that there is no more, but it suddenly appeared again. It's strange. Ms. Yang explained that: Most of our customers are Hong Kong people. They have paid for it long ago, so the room is reserved for them. I am angry . My room is also guaranteed by a credit card. Even if I don’t come today, the room fee will be paid. Are Hong Kong people more expensive than mainlanders? What era of brains. Strong contempt!! 4. Miss Yang offered to send fruits to the room. I apologize, and promised to transfer my luggage from the family room to the deluxe room before I returned from the park. But then, when I took my son back to the hotel, I went to the front desk to add an ID card and found that my luggage had not been sent to the room. . 5. Stay at Chimelong Hotel on 6-13 of this month. Each room will give you 2 tickets for Happy World, Big Circus, and Zoo (optional). When we got the tickets to enter Happy World, the staff actually said they didn’t know This ticket said that the hotel had not notified us, and held us 3 big and 1 small, under the scorching sun, waiting for the negotiation and communication between them, only shaking their heads. 6. The hotel furniture is simple and old, and the service staff has no sense of service. Everyone has a sincere smile on his face. We asked about the price of the buffet, and the lady at the entrance of the western restaurant watched herself chat and let me read the information on the glass door. 7. In the afternoon swimming in the hotel outdoor pool, it was considered Only a little bit of enjoyment. There is no one else except me and another male foreign guest. But I left my swimsuit in the changing room when I left. I only found out after checking out on the second day that there were no hotels in between. People called the room to ask me if There is something missing. (There is a room registration number when swimming, they can find it). I am a gold VIP guest of Ctrip. I stay in hotels almost all 5 stars. In contrast, I am really disappointed in this hotel and determined I won't go again. Tell everyone how I feel, and be mentally prepared before going. 
0	I haven't received it for half a month, and the other item in the same order was received before National Day. But the book hasn't arrived yet? 
0	The book is good, but in the set I received, there are two in the sixth, and the fifth is missing. Let Dangdang exchange the goods for a long time. Later, I said that I would give us a 15 yuan gift certificate as compensation. It has been a few days and I haven't seen Dangdang's reply, nor have I received the gift certificate. Also, I ordered a New Year gift for my friend’s child on January 15th. It’s the 23rd today and it has not been sent out yet. I complained, but there was no reply. Dangdang really rubbish. If you think you are reasonable, don't delete it! ! ! 
0	I went to Guiyang for the first time and booked two nights through Ctrip. Said it was Samsung. When I walked into the room, I found that the facilities were too old and the sanitary conditions were not satisfactory. The carpet was too dirty and had holes, and the walls had turned yellow. I wanted to return it overnight. Later, when I went to the street, I found that the urban construction in Guiyang was not good, so I stayed for two nights. 
1	The shell of the piano paint has a watery texture and it feels good. The configuration of this notebook is also good, and it is a reasonable match! Value for money! Installed XP system 
0	It seems that it is not suitable for the northern language habits, and the words and characters are awkwardly matched. So it was very tiring to read. The hope of reading the previous newspaper is too great, so the greater the disappointment. In short, I don't like it anymore. 
0	The location of this hotel is too far, and there are no commercial outlets nearby, which is very inconvenient. The walls of the room and the toilet are a bit dirty. Although breakfast is available, it is not served before 7 am. Because I had to catch the early bus, I had to leave the shop before 7 o'clock, so I could only eat breakfast at their paid restaurant. It’s strange that the same kitchen is paid for, but the included breakfast is not available. 
0	There is no HDMI. There is also subsidized products for the countryside. Why don’t you have that card? I also wanted to subsidize it, but the card was not found, strange! 
1	Excellent value for money, this time we booked three rooms. I feel that the service in the Midwest is sometimes much better than in the developed regions. Hotel Feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for your stay and look forward to your visit again. 
0	I bought a set for my boyfriend’s sister! My sister was very happy to get it, and started playing immediately, but from time to time it was always stuck and intermittent! It seems to be edited, and the cut is not good enough to connect! It's so shameless to give it to my sister! 
0	The room was too small. The hotel rented a four-wheeled bicycle, which was very broken and could not be ridden. Later, the waiter said that their cars were all eliminated by Oriental Land. The bar decoration was OK, but there were too many mosquitoes, like bombers. 
0	Arrived before 2pm on February 11th, my friend and I had a total of four people and booked two double-bed rooms. When we arrived, there were four waiters at the front desk. Before us, there was a waiter who was helping a family of three to check in. , The other three waiters stood there blankly, and I asked them whether they could check in for me, and replied: wait. This way of doing things has made me very upset. After finally checking in, the waiter gave the room card to the doorman. The doorman ignored our 9 big bags on the floor and rushed in with the card. We sweated on the spot. He called the doorman back, and reluctantly helped us take two bags. The rooms are in the bottom two rooms on the third floor of Building 3. This building is very quiet, quiet and creepy. The building is very old and there is an abandoned factory around it. The door of the room is a green wooden door, and the door to the bottom has a broken sensor and uses the key directly. The room is very large, very empty, the TV is very fuzzy, the bathroom is very small, it is a shower room, the facilities are very simple, far from the four-star hotel advertised by the front desk staff. In short, the first impression of this hotel gave us very uncomfortable, but what happened next was even more disheartening. Turn on the faucet, the water flowing out is very yellow and dirty, both rooms are like this, call the front desk, the front desk asked us to call the housekeeping department, so I called the housekeeping department again, and said: I just rinsed the water tank in the morning, do not leave the faucet on for ten minutes Off, it will be fine in a while. So we turned it on for a full 20 minutes, but it still didn’t get better, so we called the housekeeping department again to ask what was going on. The housekeeping department said to turn off the faucet. Now too many guests turn the faucet on. The water keeps flowing and the sediment deposits. If I don’t come down anymore, I asked when it would be better. She said it would be better in two hours. So we turned off the faucet and went out to visit Gulangyu, and we left at 3:30. We went back to the hotel at 7 o'clock in the evening and turned on the faucet. The water was still yellow. Call the front desk. The front desk said that the water at the front desk was also yellow. I didn't know when it would be better, so let me call the housekeeping department. Calling the housekeeping department, the housekeeping department said that the engineering team was rushing to repair it, and that the water pipe was broken. So when will it be repaired? The other party directly hung up my phone. I was already very upset. I couldn't wash my hands or boil water. Moreover, the front desk and the housekeeping department were very impatient when answering the phone. Now they still hung up my phone. Another phone call back to the housekeeping department, asking why she hung up on my phone. The other party actually denied me in every possible way, and asked her when she could fix the water. She told me that she would ask the engineering department now and give me an answer later. So I started to wait for a long time, and there was no reply after a quarter of an hour. At this time, we were very disappointed with the hotel and very dissatisfied with their service. So I called Ctrip and told Ctrip about the process. , I hope that Ctrip can call the hotel to reconcile, but the connection lady said to me that you should contact the hotel. I don’t know if the connection lady didn’t hear me clearly, or it’s just reading the text, I have told you clearly After negotiating with the hotel many times, the other party always shirked responsibility in various departments, and did not repair the water pipes for a whole day. Finally, I explained to the wiring lady the interests and responsibilities between Ctrip, Gulang Villa Hotel and the customer. The lady finally understood the matter and told me that she would call the hotel to let them contact me and give me an answer. A few minutes later, Ctrip called me and said it had contacted the hotel, and the hotel would contact me later. It was another ten minutes of waiting. No one in the hotel contacted us, so I called Ctrip again. Of course, I changed to a connection lady. Of course, the education on stakes and responsibilities was indispensable. The lady also told me that she would call the hotel to let them Contact me to give me an answer. A few minutes later, Ctrip called me again and asked me to wait for the hotel to contact me. A few minutes later, the front desk called and told me that the water pipe was under emergency repair and would be repaired soon. I asked how long it would take. I am going out for dinner soon. Can it be repaired after I come back? The other party said that it can be repaired, but I said, what if the repair is not good? The other party said there is no accident, I said it is impossible, what if it is not repaired? The other party finally said that if the repairs are not done, they will change rooms for you. I said to remember what you said. Then we went out for dinner. I happened to meet a tourist from a hotel while eating. I asked them if the water was available. They said that the water was good. I asked them which building they belonged to. They said building 2. I returned to the hotel two hours later and turned on the faucet. The cold water has returned to normal, but the hot water is still yellow, and the water is cut off from time to time. Call the front desk and find the lady who talked to me in front of me and asked for a room change. The lady said Your water is all right, why is your water still yellow? It feels like we are cheating on her, I said, come and see for yourself, and then she said to check what rooms are available, I said that the water in your building 2 is good, she said building 1, building 2. All are good. So the implication is that the water in our No. 3 building is not good, and it started to be bad in the morning, knowing that there is a problem with the water quality, we are arranged to stay. It is really too much! ! ! After a while, she called and said that there was a two-bedroom and one-living suite in Building 2, and asked me if I wanted it. I said what kind of bed it was. She said a double bed and a single bed. I said you call us. How do the four people sleep, she said, then she will check what room there is. After a while, she called and said that there was a standard room with sea view in Building One, and a small suite with one bedroom and one living room in Building Two. There was a room, so she wanted to fool us. I said I wanted to see the room. Then we went to the front desk. When we arrived at the front desk, she started to question our water quality. She always felt that we were fine looking for trouble. Please, it was already 11 o'clock, and we had to catch a plane the next day. If you don't want to sleep, we want to sleep! ! ! This service quality is really too much! ! ! Let her go to the room to check for herself but refused. Finally, the last two rooms are still normal. Although the facilities still cannot be measured by four stars, Shanghai’s two stars are estimated to be better than it. Finally, we conclude that the Gulang Villa Hotel is very old, with outdated facilities, a gloomy environment and extremely service attitude. Bad bad, extremely low work efficiency, very collapse! ! ! Additional comments February 25, 2008: Forgot to say, those two big bed rooms are also known as deluxe rooms 
1	"I have heard of this book for a long time, but I did not expect that after reading it inadvertently, it brought me a touch of sadness and melancholy. I don't know that fairy tales can also use plain language and plain plots to move a world-long heart. I hope that in my future days, I can live like the little prince with love and cherishment for my roses. I hope that on the day I leave this world, I will be as peaceful as the little prince. I hope that on the day I leave this world, I will leave this book of ""The Little Prince"" to my lover and let him know that for me, he is unique in this universe. "
0	Too bad, dirty. Poor, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, I will never stay in the future 
0	The book is very good, but how Dangdang did it, I have always trusted you. Wouldn’t you feel embarrassed to send an old book this time? 
0	I also use LCD; the heat is relatively large (when drawing); the hard disk 120G is enough for me, and it may be a bit low for friends who have video and audio requirements. There are no accessories, and it is more stingy than THINKPAD. 
0	"After reading it, I think it's very general. But it has not yet reached the level that requires so many people to criticize Yu Dan. Philosophy is the knowledge of ""the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom"". Everyone has their own opinions, so it is normal to criticize. Yu Dan became famous too quickly, and the Chinese have a bad habit of ""to irritate others, but not to laugh at others"", so criticism is normal. Intellectuals in ancient times emphasized ""safe and happy, not be surprised, indifferent to fame, quiet and far-reaching."" They can use the doctrine of sages to preach. Selling books and seeking profit may not be in line with the values of being a scholar, so criticism is normal. However, I can understand. "
0	Lenovo's original software doesn't like it, and there are few introductions that come with it! The original partition is too random, the grid is divided into 2 areas, 40 of 280; too inconvenient! 
1	1) Convenient transportation, a 5-minute drive from the entrance of Jinbin Expressway 2) There is a good hotel opposite, and not far from the supermarket 3) The facilities in the room are average, the bathroom decoration is rough, and the floor drain of the bathtub is not smooth 
0	"1. Although it is very close to the capital airport, the traffic is not convenient. The flight's arrival time is 23:30, and it was informed that there is a free pick-up at the time of booking, but when it arrived, I was told that ""because it exceeds 23:00, a 60 yuan pick-up fee is required."" . . Regardless of whether it is charged or the price is high or low, it is reasonable to declare to the customer in advance. 2. Because it is too close to the airport, almost no Taxi is willing to pick up passengers. . . 3. There is no hair dryer in the room. I want to contact the front desk to borrow it, but the phone fails. . . As a part of the hotel business, daily inspection of guest room equipment should be the most basic task. . . "
1	To a large extent, Taiwanese people are more ethical than our people here. In some companies, the phenomenon of rule by man is very obvious. You must understand human nature and follow his path. Regardless of the age group, this set of books is worth reading and researching, and one or two experiences will benefit a lot. Liu Yongyong's experience tells us how people work and how society works. At this point, at least people can fall a lot less. Compared to some scam stories of the soul, I still like these spicy dealing series.

0	After reading other people's comments, I decided to buy them all as a birthday present for my son. But the 4-year-old son doesn't seem to buy it. From an adult's point of view, the whole story is boring from character to plot. My son's reaction is the same as mine. 
1	Well, I have used a lot of vocabulary books. Since the freshman year, we have been running slogans, life is endless, and more than six levels (not only need to pass, but a good score). Therefore, words, like a shadow, I have used Xinghuo, Wang Changxi Yes, in fact, it’s okay. After all, any learning is up to you. The reference book is just for reference. The red book is easier to remember. This is pretty sure. The illustrations inside are also very cute. In fact, they are like Changxi’s vocabulary knowledge. The given is very detailed, very good, but the content is too small, it will inevitably be boring, personal experience is that New Oriental seems to be more efficient, personal opinion 
1	There is nothing to say about ASUS, good heat dissipation and low sound. The shell of the piano paint has a watery texture and it feels good. The configuration is relatively uniform, cost-effective, and the configuration is very balanced, especially the 3470 graphics card, which is very attractive. Basically, no major upgrades are needed. Personally think that 2G of memory is enough. And this is a discrete graphics card, so it won't take up system memory for video memory. 
0	The room environment is not good! Dark and humid! Not like a star hotel! Disappointed. But the service is still OK! 
0	The overall feeling is very bad! The room facilities, service, and the breakfast buffet are very poor (the variety is small, I once asked the waiter why there is no meat dishes and meat dishes, answer: Isn’t egg a meat dish?) 
1	I got a perfect screen, but the viewing angle (clear) is relatively small. I don’t know if it’s a common problem with the notebook screen. After getting it, follow the instructions for three charging and three charging (it is said that it is three charging and three charging, but it is 93% of the battery when it is turned on). It’s probably 4 hours or so when I’m on the wireless when I’m discharging, which really exceeded my expectations. The weight is also lighter than expected, medium level, right? There is no extra mess, especially the volume control button is a button instead of a touch type, which is completely impractical. 
0	I booked a triple room two days in advance. I arrived at 8 o'clock in the morning on the 1st. I was told that there was no triple room when I registered. Let us first transfer the salute deposit and ask the front desk if there is room at noon? The answer is ambiguous: let's talk about it then! Because this trip is mainly to bring children out to play, considering that the hotel is located in a busy city and close to Wangfujing Bookstore, and the surrounding hotel has a triple room. The holiday is only three days, and the time is tight and I don’t care too much. I can’t even wash myself. I went out to play directly. I came here after three o’clock in the afternoon. I thought that the room should be okay. Adults and children are tired. I want to take a good rest. I was told that there is still no triple room. Let’s change the standard room. The standard room should be the standard room. When an extra bed can be requested (although the child is only 12 years old, it is 171 cm and 70 kg is the same as an adult), and he replied that there is no extra bed. When the lover and her reasoned, he even said: This is the only way I can do it! The attitude is more arrogant. I called Ctrip to explain the situation. Ctrip asked her to answer the phone again, but nothing changed. I asked Ctrip to contact another hotel nearby. Later, the front desk called a manager who was in his fifties and his attitude was good. Said that it must be solved for us. After about 20 minutes, we finally added an extra bed, but the room is too small and there is not much space after the extra bed, alas! Just live it! In other respects, I really don’t dare to compliment. The entire hotel is a remodeled like the original unit office building. It is completely a guest house. In a dilapidated alley, business guests are avoided (losing their status), breakfast is poor, and it has just been renovated. There are still smells in the corridor rooms. My wife and children are more sensitive to the smell of decoration, and they slept with the windows open all night. The next day, out of apology to my lover’s child, I used Ctrip to transfer to the North Garden, which is less than 100 meters away. The four-star standard room is 638 yuan, which is almost a sky and an underground. I firmly think that I will bring my family out for thousands of years later. Never live in a non-star class anymore, you must live in a three-star or above, and would rather have an extra bed or a squeeze! 
0	"This hotel is known as a three-star hotel, but in fact, the hardware and service standards of this hotel cannot be starred at all at present. Entering the lobby, there is a sweet water smell, and the alcohol smell of high liquor fills the air, which is suffocating; we asked to see the room, the reception lady Let us go up to the fifth floor with unhappy faces. What we saw were outdated facilities, rotten and moldy walls, and the furnishings were fairly neat. The only thing that could express satisfaction was the cleanliness of the sheets, but there was a pungent detergent smell. , I asked if there is air-conditioning, the answer is 24 hours...I think this hotel is a place where the city hall entertains guests. It should be not bad, so I stayed. I didn't expect a series of troubles..... .First of all, I can’t access the Internet. The answer is, 4 yuan an hour, I took the ""cat"" and the router in a while, it was scary, no more; I asked for ten bottles of mineral water, only seven bottles, the waiter said there are only so many Yes, it is required to sign for confirmation. The waiter said that the two bottles in the room should be counted together. I said, don't count, you count when you round the room, or you will make a mistake. The waiter said the same, 9 bottles of three yuan and a bottle of 27 yuan. ,. As a result, we were required to pay for the two bottles of water in the room when we checked out. We explained that it was useless. We still charged two more bottles of water. From this point of view, the management is too messy...All the waiters are grandma. , Can't offend, there is no sense of service at all, it is choking; the air conditioner is very weak, and I can hardly feel the air conditioner in the second half of the night, and I wake up with freezing, but we all caught a cold and went back home to hang water ); Forget it, don’t say it, there is no result anyway, just remind friends that you must not stay in this kind of hotel, and I hope that Ctrip can have an evaluation method for the hotel that you are affiliated with. I am a diamond member now, or the first Once I met such a hotel, it was too bad...Because of the cold night, I caught the wind and chill, I just received a drip in the hospital, and I thought I had to write something, that's it, sleep, I hope not There is a second time!

0	It has been popular for 40 years, at least it is also a picture book of 1968. The story of 1968 does not seem to arouse any interest in my daughters. It is not attractive to me either. Hope the children will be more interested. 
1	The executive deluxe room is a bit expensive and the room size is small! The overall service is okay, but the room cleaning staff is not very polite, and sometimes they come in immediately after knocking on the door! Hotel location is good! 
1	Good in all aspects, and the price/performance ratio is relatively high. Some facilities in the room are delivered only after calling, such as hair dryers, maps, etc. I live in Zone B, which seems to be of a lower grade, but it's okay. It's just that half of the wall blocks the view in the room I live in, but the one my colleague lives in is very beautiful facing the lake. The fitness area is being renovated, so it's a pity that I didn't go swimming and exercise. The lobby is full of upscale. The interior of the room is relatively simple. Breakfast is ok. The location is also okay, although it is still a little away from the beautiful Tuanjiu. 
0	Deceived! As soon as I got it, I knew it was not Hu Lancheng's original work! Still so expensive! hateful! In order not to spoil my feeling! I decided not to watch it! Going to find someone to sell it someday! So I bought two Hu's books again. How can I say not to spoil my feelings? Sure enough, the literary talent can't bear to let go, but why there are always mountains and rivers this book out of stock out of stock Helpless!

0	The so-called promotion involves too much intrigue in the process. I don't like this style. It is purely a personal opinion. 
1	Very good, good service, located in the downtown area, convenient transportation, but the price is high! 
0	It's too general, slightly worse than the Home Inn he used to run! In addition, there is no signal on the mobile phone on the first floor, so I don’t know what about other floors? This is true for people who are not familiar with Chengdu, but later learned that there are many property-owned apartment hotels in Chengdu, only 138, much better than it! 
0	1. If the memory is 2G, it will be fine. 2. The hard disk partition is unreasonable. The system disk is 220G, then one disk is 9.5G and the other is 1.5G. What does this partition mean? Do you have to go to after-sales if you want to repartition? 
1	"Have to admire the courage and ability of the author of this book. Looking at the introduction, it seemed that I had been a reporter in this industry for decades, and then I felt that there were too many dirty things in it. In the end, it was the professional conscience of a reporter that he made up his mind to make it public. If this were in China, it is estimated that he would no longer have to be in the ""circle"". There is a price for breaking the unspoken rules, and it is the same everywhere. What I don’t understand is that no one from the business world to the government agencies in the United States comes out to take care of such a sensitive book, leaving it to sell well for decades. I think it is a miracle. "

0	The rooms are small, the location is poor, and the transportation is inconvenient. It is recommended not to stay in Lianyungang. Otherwise, the consequences will be serious. 
1	It can be said to be the best hotel in Jinhua, but not the most cost-effective. Jinhua is not better than it, but the one with the same star is not the best, go there, the price is a bit higher 
1	I bought a lot of gardening books, read a lot of gardening books, and started to regret buying many books after I got them. But reading this book made me feel quite surprised. It mainly talks about garden design, how to design the garden, how to arrange the plane, which kinds of plants to plant, where to put it, how to make the fence, which kind of flower pot to buy, where to put it... Suitable for more than 20 square meters, yes People in the open air garden come to see. For a novice gardener like me, this book is really a bible. Be prepared to take the time to DIY according to the book. 
0	I bought this book after listening to the boss’s introduction. I thought it contained some short stories or short poems suitable for children to read. I didn’t expect it to be pure theory. As an educator, I certainly know that reading aloud to a child before enlightenment is of great benefit, so no matter how good the book is, I think it is of no use to me. I left it there after turning a few pages. 
1	I first read the electronic version on the Internet, and then I became more and more in love with it. I almost read it all at once, so I bought the book collection on Dangdang. By reading this book, I, a person of 86 years, can understand the life of my brother in that era. At that time, a lot of studying went to technical school, and then went to work in the factory. At that time, although life was a bit difficult, without computers and not so many electronic products, I still enjoyed it. The author's writing is also very humorous, which made me laugh out loud several times. After reading it, there are many things worth thinking about. It is really a very good work. 
0	The price is ok, but the location is a bit back, many taxis are not well known, and it is a one-way road so the traffic is not very convenient. But considering the price factor, this store is okay. The room with a window is exposed in the corridor, no curtains are not good for sound insulation. So privacy is not very good. 
1	"For this (N+1th) check-in, although I have already and deliberately stated on Ctrip’s order ""Please be sure to notify the hotel to prepare a luggage rack for me in the room"", but I still found the hotel when I checked in. And not ready. . . Fortunately, a beautiful manager named Angela at the front desk took care of it in time. I am quite satisfied, and I would like to express my gratitude to him (please note, it is to Angela, not to the hotel)! "
1	"No writer has gone through so many years like Zhang Ailing. There are countless readers who read her, discuss her, and pay attention to her life. There are so many people who imitate her intentionally or unintentionally when writing articles. What she writes is all personal ""little things"", imperfect human world, emotions that are not whitewashed. It is for this reason that she can resonate with readers across time. This world is indeed like this, and all feelings are also Not as good as we hope or advertise. Zhang Ailing said something we didn't want to admit, but she was right. "
1	There are various forms, with connections, jigsaw puzzles, and coloring~~~ Moderate shades, and some questions are very simple. For four-year-olds, you don’t have to think about them; some questions are a bit difficult, so I have to ponder it for a while; I think this kind of arrangement is very good. Children don’t like to do difficult questions at all, and they will get bored for a while; if they are too simple, the child will finish a book after going home at night, which is meaningless; this kind of simple content is interspersed. A few difficult problems, not bad; (Of course, it is not difficult for other children, maybe we are lacking in some aspects; it also shows that this set of books is more comprehensive) 
1	The network speed is super slow, and the connection is often dropped, and the front desk service is not very professional. 
1	I just read a book about how to say that children will listen and read this again. I feel that this is more suitable for Chinese babies. Nowadays, many parents are trying to learn all kinds of knowledge for their children prematurely, such as the three-character classics of foreign language Analects composition, etc. This book has benefited me a lot. My son is now 1 year old and 10 months old, and has been very fond of reading and listening to stories since he was 1. After reading this book, I hope to guide him to cultivate this hobby in a better way, instead of prematurely occupying his supposedly happy childhood with various studies. Many aspects of this book are quite meaningful. 
0	Look at Dangdang's recommendation, but it's really not good! Words are not commonly used, and the logic of comics is not good at all. Maybe it's because of Korean thinking we can't understand it! But I suggest you don’t look so hard, it’s not really good 
0	"The running speed is a bit slow, the free anti-virus software can only be used for 90 days. Two DVD disks are given. There is no CD-ROM drive for ""Chicken Rib"". If you use it, you have to use an external CD-ROM drive or a synthetic USB drive. trouble. "
1	Close to the subway, there is a supermarket and Café de Coral fast food nearby, which is more convenient. Although it is close to the funeral home, there is nothing particularly wrong with it. The room is not big and has fruits. Quiet and comfortable. The toilet is not big, and the toilet is too close to the wall to feel comfortable. If you don't have a comb, you have to ask the customer service. The waiter is more enthusiastic and patiently guides you and tells you how to get a ride. Overall it's pretty good. 
1	In the process of reading this book, I kept thinking and reflecting on myself from time to time. Try to find the long-lost true self according to the method in the book; try to feel joy, peace and love... Although it is not easy, I found that some of the negative emotions that have bothered me are slowly losing. I think, just like what the book says: Emotion is a kind of energy that will come and go... This is really a wonderful reading experience, and more importantly, this is a long-lost spiritual baptism! Don't miss it! \(^o^)/~ 
0	Widescreen, a bit unaccustomed, but this is not a problem with Jingdong; I used to remember to send a mouse, but now there is no 
0	The driver is more difficult to install, and I'm half tired. ASUS's repair rate seems to be a bit high. I hope I'm a lucky one and don't run into such things. 
0	The quality of the book is good and the printing is exquisite; the content is very readable, and there are basically no typos. However, the procuratorate has written it as a prosecutor’s office, and the story is too ideal, especially the conflict between Daixi and the company, Wang Wei, etc., some plots are not It is logical. 
1	I went to Lanzhou City for the first time and booked the Friendship Hotel on Ctrip.com. This is a hospitality hotel of the former municipal party committee. The building should have history. I stayed in the Jiabin Building, and the facilities in the standard room were OK, clean and tidy. The main disadvantage of the room is that the TV is relatively old, there are fewer TV stations, and the signal is not good, but it is not a big problem for me not to watch TV. The plain white sheets and cleanness of the bathroom still make me feel good about the room overall. After the gate of the hotel, there is a bustling commercial street nearby, especially the Cai Genxiang and Jinding Beef Noodles are very good. Not far to the west, there is a very good Internet cafe on the third floor of the Southeast Building at Dunhuang intersection. Opposite the hotel is the Provincial Museum, and the surrounding environment is prosperous and convenient. 
0	From the trivial things, it’s not like a four-star hotel: the doorman seems invisible when the car reaches the door, and talks to himself. There is no even the door, the breakfast variety is few, and the room facilities are not as good as Samsung. But this hotel is considered the best in Yixian, if you want to stay, you can only use it 
0	Hey eh eh eh, too bad luck, less than 2 days after the purchase, it dropped another 200 oceans. Although the price range of digital products has changed greatly, I still feel very depressed and hope that the added points will compensate. 
0	Look at Dangdang's recommendation, but it's really not good! Words are not commonly used, and the logic of comics is not good at all. Maybe it's because of Korean thinking we can't understand it! But I suggest you don’t look so hard, it’s not really good 
1	The hotel is very nice, the double bed room is quite big, the room is quite big, all the facilities are good, the bathroom has two separate spaces for the bathtub and the shower, the service is also very thoughtful, I even called on the second night of the stay Come to ask any comments and suggestions for the hotel. As soon as you leave the hotel, you will find the trestle bridge, which is a bit far from the May Fourth Square. A taxi is about ten to twenty yuan. Overall it is good, I will choose this hotel next time I visit Qingdao. 
1	"Prospective, new mothers, I recommend you to take a look! Every mother has ""milk"", no mother does not have ""milk"", if others say that you do not have ""milk"", or if you feel that you do not have ""milk"", it is the problem that you have not tried your best to ""milk"". I didn't want to be a ""good cow"". I firmly believe this sentence. . . To support breast milk, breast milk is the best food for the baby; the baby needs the mother's breast milk very much, and the mother's ""breast"" is the best comfort product for the baby. . . With the parenting notes of breastfeeding mothers, I have been supporting me till now, and I feel very, very happy. "
0	"It's very easy to read. There are only a few pages in total. The original text of ""Zhuangzi"" occupies 53 pages, and the layout is sparse, so it is easy to handle. It feels to me that it is really simple to use Zhuangzi's reputation. Zhuangzi told a lot of stories and fables. This kind of originality is commendable, but Yu Dan's book is nothing new. I have not listened to her lectures. Maybe the body language will be vivid and intriguing. Anyway, just looking at the text, there are works better than her. "
1	Advantages: A good notebook is a small screen. Insufficient: A good notebook is a small screen. 
0	1. It is not an XP system, and there is no driver for XP! 2. The USB design is unreasonable! 3. The hard disk partition is not good. 
1	This book is by far the most comprehensive book among the butterfly books read. Many rare butterflies can be found in this book. It can be said to be a pretty good reference book. This book provides a good reference for those who love butterflies! I really like it. The day I first got this book, I saw it all night! The fly in the ointment is that some of the butterfly specimens I collected still cannot identify subjects here, and of course I don't ask too much; there are also slight printing defects, which is a pity as a collection of books. It is hoped that the business, even if it does not bear the fault of printing, must check the printing quality. 
1	"I bought this set of books before the Dragon Boat Festival. My son likes cars, so I gave him ""Rings of Wheels"" first. I can’t put it down. I have to tell him every day. Whenever I really have something to say, he will read it by himself. (My son is 5 years old and can know Some words, but I read slowly, I prefer to listen to me), what pencil carts, pumpkin carts, endless imagination and funny plots, I can laugh out of it. Yesterday I gave him the rest of the books, and asked me to talk about it with ""Busy Town"". I look forward to every book in the set can bring endless happiness and endless imagination to my son. "
1	At first I thought it was a novel about the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and the story of the parents. It felt more real. How did it turn back later, it became more and more romantic, and it was very Qiong Yao. After reading the unspeakable feeling, both angry and funny, Fei Fei grew from an angry little wife to a strong woman, and then was mercilessly abandoned by the prince charming in her heart, and finally there is someone who can support her to live. My daughter died in a car accident. The more you look back, the more people feel unreal. But seeing Uncle Feifei's family punish her evil mother-in-law is very enjoyable. 
0	Huidong Hotel: 1. There is basically no difference between business single room and ordinary single room (in terms of room size and supporting facilities). The main difference is the floor. The general arrangement of business is the top few floors. It is recommended that you choose ordinary single room; The lighting is very dim, and it feels a bit depressing; 3. The decoration of the room is relatively poor, it should be the worst in the four-star hotel I have ever stayed in (but no way 
0	The place is hard to find, it is actually the International Youth Hostel. The environment is average and the facilities are simple. It takes more than 10 minutes to walk to the subway station. 
1	Stayed for three days and felt that the service was ok, and the buffet at night was not bad. 
0	I feel that this hotel’s service is not good: 1 I booked for one day and checked out before 12:00 the next day. When I went out for dinner more than 11 o’clock and came back at 11:30, I couldn’t get in. Obviously there was still half an hour It was annoying to lock the door for me when the time came! The front desk explained that my room card and mobile phone were degaussed together. My phone was in my pants pocket and the room card was on my shirt. The front desk was looking for such a reason to justify myself, which was really excessive! 2 I stayed in a deluxe double room, but the decoration started very early the next morning. It was noisy and noisy, so I could not rest well. Since I know there will be decoration the next day, why did you give it to me the day before? Arrange a room so close? baffling. 3 It is a three-star, but it feels that the grade is still far from good. The bathroom is too simple, the towels and bath towels are very old, the toilet is basically difficult to run, the pajamas are dirty and I dare not wear them, and there is no free razor. The TV couldn't be turned on at first, so it took a long time for the waiter to fix it. I travel a lot and live in a lot of hotels. This is the first time I come across a hotel of this kind. I think I will go to Hohhot again in the future and will not consider living in this one again! 
0	This book is not good. Compared with the <<Ming Dynasty Things>> I bought together, it can only be placed in a bookcase as a display 
0	Although the theory in the book is good, it is too theoretical. I thought the book would arrange some content suitable for reading aloud, but it just listed a lot of what you want to do. I was disappointed! 
0	The hotel facilities are very general, not as good as a three-star, and even some newly opened non-star business hotels. The rooms are very small and the service is average. The price is very worthless and the price/performance ratio is too bad. Will not stay in the future. 
0	The wine red color of the book is not as good-looking and dazzling as expected, there is no software, and you have to install it yourself, which is a bit troublesome, ha ha! In addition, after a while of testing, it was quite hot, and it seemed that the heat dissipation was not good! 
1	The speed is good, test the Warcraft stand-alone, not stuck at all. It is fully functional, and I think it should be quite cost-effective below 4K. XP is very easy to install, and the system is in the top after two hours. I started to read comments from people saying that XP is difficult to install. Don't misunderstand others by saying that. I started to fancy 3 models, HP541, THINKPADSL400, ACER422G32, ACER421G25. The results exclude THINKPAD, HP541 is out of stock, 422g32 and 421g25 have poor performance, but the price is a few hundred poor, and finally bought this. 
1	The location of the hotel is a bit off, but it is actually quite easy to find. Take the subway and get off at Causeway Bay Station, then transfer to the tram to Happy Valley, and get off at the terminus (about 15 minutes). The hotel is located next to the Sanatorium and Hospital of the terminus. (Note: Hong Kong trams are different from domestic trams. There is no number, and only the name of the terminal is marked at the front of the train). If you take a taxi, it is 5-10 minutes from Causeway Bay. The hotel’s facilities are newer, and the indoor environment is good, but the rooms are so small and the beds are pitiful. The single bed in the standard room really can only sleep one person, and even the fatter person can’t sleep. The service is ok. 
1	This is a fascinating book, a lovely encyclopedia, and when I see the introduction, I can’t help but feel moved. A good man should learn everything and be able to comprehend by analogy. From a young age, he has been full of wildness, and has an unspeakable complex for that kind of rough life. All of this can be found in the book. There is a great possibility that he will take the role of father. Haha! Of course, this book was bought too early for the younger son. I hope my baby can grow up early and explore with my mother soon. 
1	The business standard room is relatively large, but the bathroom is very small. The sound insulation effect is not very good. Generally speaking, it is clean and tidy. The traffic is very convenient and it is very close to Jing'an Temple. 
1	The location is very convenient, just a 3-minute walk near the railway station, but because the first time I went there was a taxi but was slaughtered by the driver for a starting price. The only drawback is that it is too close to the railway station and the sound of the train is troublesome. Xuzhou has been an important traffic road since ancient times, ha ha. If possible, stay next time. 
0	I live on the first floor, the room is too small, and the window faces a wall. Won't live it again 
0	The translation language of the book is average, and it is not easy to read. I bought it after reading the reviews, but that is not the case, and there is not much scientific reasoning. Not worth buying. 
1	1\The service attitude of the previous evaluation is very good, and the reception is great. 2\The room supplies and facilities are OK, but the window can't be opened, it is depressing, a bit smelly, and the air conditioner is good. 3\The location is very good, away from the subway Very close, very close to the shopping mall, convenient for shopping. 4\ is that Ctrip does not have breakfast and it is annoying. Haha, I also saw someone hosting a wedding banquet. 400 yuan is okay. 
1	Very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good very good 
1	The home is very good-looking, the workmanship is very good, the quality of the Thinkpad brand is consistent, and I am very satisfied. 
0	The rooms are generally good, clean and cost-effective, but the door is closed when you go back too late at night, it is not convenient to ask people to open the door. Also, the air conditioner is not central air conditioner, it is quite cold in winter, and the noise is too loud when the air conditioner is on. There is no partition in the bathing place, and the floor is filled with water as soon as the bath is taken. 
0	The front desk service is okay, the room is really not good, the air conditioner is very noisy, the bed is actually high on one side and low on the other, this price is really not worth it, I will not choose it next time. 
1	The overall feeling of this hotel is pretty good, no matter from price, travel, shopping, or booking air tickets (Air China is on the right side of it) is very convenient. It's just that there is no computer in the room, and I don't know where it says free internet access is available. Additional comments October 12, 2007: By the way, it is also very convenient to go to the airport, the airport bus is just below it, and it runs every half an hour 
1	At present, there are very few notebooks below 3k in stock, which is relatively good. The configuration is relatively complete, with a camera, the overall workmanship is fair, and the ghost version of the system is easy to get. 
1	cheap price. The performance is good. The configuration is better. In addition, the inner bag is delivered in the box, and the quality of the bag is good. 
0	"This is the worst book I have seen in this year. I read it in less than 2 hours (I really don’t want to waste too much time on this book). Unfortunately, I didn’t get any content. The only thing the scholar mentioned is useful is to tell the rich to learn from Western rich men and know how to give back to society. What is fairness? In this book is the answer to all questions. It is a panacea solution. This is trapped in the ""circular argument"" of traditional Chinese culture. If fairness is the solution to the problem, then we should also discuss in depth how to construct fairness. If it is guaranteed, it is a topic of sociological concern and a topic of management discussion. Fairness cannot be explained by the word. If the author himself should be a very powerful person, he can know that by knowing his many years of experience, he is amazing. But this book is really very general, and the hype is very suspect. There are hundreds of comments on this book in Dangdang, and I feel that quite a few of them are false. In addition, the price of this book is rather high. For such a small book, it costs 33 yuan, not a bit expensive, but very expensive. It is recommended not to buy. "
1	The configuration is still mainstream, with complete interfaces (USB port*3, HIMI*1), and accessories (Bluetooth, camera, microphone, Modem), and general games are not a problem. PS: The problem that the FN function key cannot be used can be solved by installing a software, which is available on Samsung's official website. 
0	general. Except cheap. One big problem is the design of the bathtub. The water splashed during the bath will flow along the surface of the bathtub against the wall to the ground outside. After washing, the bathroom is full of water. It took a lot of effort for the boss to research it out. It turned out that the plane inside was inclined, so the water flowed down and flowed outside. Also, the hotel does not have a lobby, and a small area shared with an apartment or business district next door is called a lobby. It is quite different from Yanshan. Next time I go back to Shijiazhuang, not this one. There is also a point that is very convenient to buy things. Next to it are Northland Supermarket and Northland Mall, as well as McDonald's and Gnaw Chicken. 
0	"The content of the book can be summed up as follows: 20-year-old girls must learn to behave smoothly, and they must know how to ""think about themselves"" so that they can create a successful life. Perhaps it is precisely because it requires a smooth life that I can't do. So i don't like this book very much "
1	Many times, when you lose, you know how hateful and shameful your ignorance was. However, it has been lost, you have to look at your beloved one, from a distance, there is no way. How helpless is this life. How many times have you dreamed of going back to the past and having the opportunity to choose again, but it's just a dream, just a dream. After waking up from the dream, while holding the phone, I don’t know who to call. You have nothing to say, only to remain silent. Even make a thicker and thicker shell, so that no one can see the heart in the shell. Everyone thinks you can't fathom. You are drinking and singing. 
0	The battery is not strong, 3 hours is the limit, the screen is not as good as you imagined, watching movies is no problem, the color difference is still a bit when processing pictures, I don’t know if it will be useful to adjust it, it seems that LED does not guarantee the restoration of the image display . 
1	The white books are small and beautiful. The battery life is long enough, so you don’t have to worry about power problems if you stay outside for a day. When I bought this book, I mainly fancy this. The running speed is also good enough to meet general office needs. 
0	No system, open the machine in your hand, you can only look at it casually, because there is no system! No system will have such a price! When opening the box, it turned out to be a carton with another box. There are so many boxes, but there is no mouse and bag! 
1	After using it for a few days, I haven't found any major problems. I added 2G memory, the speed is very fast, the development is good, and the business machine is solid. 
1	I just received the book and didn't read it seriously. I flipped through it. I feel pretty good. I can't wait to say a few words first. The quality of the book is good, and the captured pictures are exquisite and representative, making the content introduced in the text clear and immersive. It is worth mentioning that the text is vivid and beautiful, and it reads fluently. It seems to have the sweet sound of a mountain spring, which is easy for children to accept and love. There is also a little knowledge in the picture. Although the knowledge involved is not very detailed, it is enough to benefit the children. Of course, it is also for me. I am already lacking in this knowledge, so let's learn it with my children. 
0	The deluxe single room booked is 1/3 smaller than the double room, and the facilities are also poor, even without coffee table and armchair, but the price is much more expensive than the double room, it is really incredible! I am a frequent visitor of the double room in this hotel. Perhaps the hotel itself felt unreliable. When I was out, I quietly moved in two armchairs and swapped out the back chairs in the original room. But because the room space is too small, the chairs can’t actually be seated. Can put things in! The front desk service was not bad. I forgot to bring my ID card. I told it to be a frequent visitor. I checked my computer information and let me move in. 
1	I like the role of Xiao Fei. I love Ouyang violently and for a lifetime. Even though this man always loses to her, after she hates him, she still regards him as a treasure in her palm. Ouyang is such a cool man who makes people hateful. He is really a bird that is obsessed with women. He flies everywhere, always looking for the nest of dreams. . . The main characters in the author's article are very vivid, as if they are happy and sad right in front of your eyes, with a smile, and occasionally read this book with a little heartache, and feel a little bit sad. . . I feel like I'm blended with the people in the book 
0	The keyboard is nice, but I still feel awkward when typing. The arrow keys are too small. 
1	The heat dissipation is not bad, the cpu temperature and hard disk temperature for playing games are below 56, the speed is very good, and the graphics card is also good 
1	They are a group of mysterious and beautiful women. From the ancient Lei ancestor to the last Wanru, each one has attracted countless people. When we turn to history, they seem to be men's foils, but when you study them carefully, you will find that they are indispensable characters, the most beautiful flowers of every dynasty, and the pearls of every emperor. Some of them are in love with their husbands, helping men lay down a world, some sharing glory, helping the emperor to create a prosperous world, some being displaced, sharing the joys and sorrows with the frustrated him, and some... all this is not just a story, but also a history. Mysterious and gorgeous history. 
1	A very warm novel. I have read the e-book, but I still want to buy a collection. I hope that I will be moved by seeing it in the future. In fact, the content of the novel is very simple-a pair of lovers reunited in a broken mirror. The previous love was fiery, separated, only the bodies of two people were separated, and their hearts were always dependent on each other. We don't want to miss it, but there are always so many reasons that make us miss it. So cherish what you already have. Daxiong and Xiaojing can be together perfectly when they missed it; when we miss it, can we still have the courage to regain the love we once had? 
0	The quality is problematic. I received the notebook on the 25th. It was the second discharge this morning, and I couldn't turn on the machine. After plugging in the power cord, the adapter light turned on, but the reminder light on the notebook was off. I don’t return anymore, I'd better ask ASUS to repair it directly. 
1	As soon as you get the device, you can check whether it is a genuine product or someone can handle it. Next? See the brackets below. What else are there too, such as the printer, what to do, and the configuration description. The most interesting thing is the screen. This time, this time is really a perfect screen, it is the highest one. 
0	It happened that my major and health care were very close, so I paid more attention to this hot book and purchased several similar hot books including this one. After reading it carefully, I feel that everyone should go to the hospital for clinical diagnosis and treatment if they are in physical conditions. Although the process is difficult and expensive, it is reliable, at least much more reliable than this book. The score should be less than 50 points. 
1	Affected by the movie of the same name, Edward Norton and Naomi Watts always appear in front of them when reading. At this time, I have not finished reading. I just read about Walter's death, and I feel sorry and helpless in my heart. Maugham’s novels always touched and sentimental for me. After reading, I often fell into deep thought and couldn't help myself for a long time. The description of the old Chinese town environment and characters in this novel displeases me. Although it may be the actual situation at that time, Maugham seems to be full of Westerners' superiority to backward China. I am a narrow and overly sensitive Chinese. Quite upset. The general feeling is that I like it very much. 
1	The lobby of the hotel is too small, and the decoration feels old. The attitude of the service staff is not good, and finally I found a foreign waiter to check in. It feels better than the Chinese service ecology. Overall it does not feel like a five-star hotel but rather a four-star hotel Two talents give a chocolate, alas, it's not so stingy. After cleaning the room, the middle waiter deliberately put the Evian mineral water in a prominent position at the head of the bed. Needless to say, the purpose of washing utensils is three-star. standard... 
1	The room facilities are relatively outdated, and the air-conditioning sound is relatively loud. The swimming pool charges the guests of the superior room, and the charges are as high as the outside charges. I find it unacceptable. The swimming pool is too deep. I told the waiter inside and I didn’t care. Breakfast was average 
1	I previously knew about this book from a parenting magazine. After reading it, I found that it was aimed at children and parents in middle school, but I think it’s better to read it earlier than later as a parent, and from the introduction of this book I Learn more about Xu Xiaoping and some of his good books and his professional concept. I think the important thing about this book is not that it tells a few stories, but that it allows you to recognize your shortcomings about your children's future, correct your parents' ideas, and build a better future with your children. Yes, it's worth seeing. It would be better if you change to Xu Xiaoping's writing style. 
1	It is said that this is the best three-star hotel in Beihai. The business is not so good and the popularity is very high. When I arrived that night, the atmosphere in the lobby was strong and I felt very warm. The bathroom in the room is a bit small, but the service is good and I feel relieved. The room I stayed in also delivered breakfast, fruit baskets, and chocolates in the evening. The most amazing thing is that the floor attendant told me that Internet guests can also iron clothes for free...Wow. In the evening, the assistant manager in the lobby also called me on the phone. I told her that the TV was not well tuned, and she even came up to help me tune it. Overall it feels good, the deputy manager of the lobby asked me to help promote it, and I agreed haha. 
1	Good work; relatively light. The volume is much louder than my T61, and the sound quality is good. Other weight, easy to get fingerprints, is not a problem. 
0	After reading other people's comments, I decided to buy them all as a birthday present for my son. But the 4-year-old son doesn't seem to buy it. From an adult's point of view, the whole story is boring from character to plot. My son's reaction is the same as mine. 
0	This shop is the most expensive of the more than 10 Beijing Homestays I have lived in, so we passed with hope. Indeed, the entrance is a very big lobby, but this is the only advantage. Entering the room, it goes without saying, It was changed from an old hotel, and there is no warm feeling like home. The facilities are outdated and have not been completely refurbished. The most terrible thing is that a cockroach that is twice as large as a one-yuan coin crawls on our colleague’s lap. Shandong Dahan was evil 
0	How can this hotel be a five-star hotel? The hotel rooms are small, the decoration is ordinary, and the bed is smaller than other five-star hotels. Let alone these. The attitude of the waiter is really flattering. I live on the executive floor, When CHECK IN, the lady at the front desk was actually answering the phone and chatting, talking about eating stinky tofu. The price of 1200, the pre-authorization only made 1500. Then I went to dinner at night and signed about 400. The waiter did not remind me, and I did not think about it. At night, I was ready to go to bed, and suddenly the phone called and forced me to go to the front desk to swipe my card. I had no choice but to change my clothes and hold the credit card before going to the front desk. The hotel hardware did not say anything, but The standard of the waiter really needs to be improved, otherwise it won't match the price! 
1	The price-performance ratio is good, the appearance, feel and performance of the notebook are not bad, after all, it is something of a big brand. 
1	As a five-star hotel, the hardware is poor, the decoration is long, the TV is small, but the location is good, downstairs is DFS opposite to Harbour City, but the price is not high 
0	If this hotel is not located on the edge of the South Lake, it is the level of a guest house. We booked a standard room of 758, but only one breakfast voucher. The other person wants breakfast, which costs 68 yuan, and whether you are an adult or a child ! And the breakfast is very low. The wallpaper in the room we stayed in also fell off. It happened to be raining when I went, and the walkway was still leaking. And the hotel does not have a luggage cart to help guests carry their luggage. I really don’t know how it was rated as a five-star Yes. Maybe it is the behavior of the local government. A cost-effective hotel! 
0	Quite bad, I really don't know how the hotel was upgraded to five stars. After the star rise, the price is still longer, but the service is getting worse and worse. It is recommended that the National Tourism Administration re-evaluate it, otherwise it will gain some benefit. If there are other newly built 4, 5 star hotels in Liuzhou, it is estimated that few people will live here 
1	The workmanship is excellent. Under the premise of maintaining the high-performance configuration, the heat dissipation of the machine is very smooth, and the temperature of the whole machine has been around 30 ° after one day of starting! 
0	The weight is still a bit heavy, not as light as imagined, but I can't feel it in a backpack. It is much lighter than the Dell in the company, and heavier than other netbooks. There is only one memory slot, but the standard 1G is enough. Atom's performance is not particularly powerful. 
1	A book to improve high personal accomplishment and ability, no matter how we look at Mary Kay Cosmetics Company or Mary Kay Ashchiren from a perspective, the wisdom that can be given to us is indeed self-evident. 
0	There is a bright spot on the screen, but in the start bar, it can’t be seen when you use it~~The shell and keyboard are more flowery, and the claw pattern~~You have to go with a full set of clothes~~ 
1	It feels okay, but not as good as Shangri-La, and the price and agreement are no different. So it is more cost-effective to go to Shangri-La. 
1	The book shows us a perfect love story. With the development of the plot, I also feel sweet, sorrow, loss, and happiness in my heart. The process of reading a book is a process of making myself love again. We also need passion in our lives. In the novel, we will find the feeling of love that we have had. When you are confused about happiness, you will think of not letting go of the happiness in your hands. That way, when you find that it is your favorite, you can no longer find it. Learn to love, grasp love, grasp love, and cherish love, then there will be happiness.

1	"I bought this book because of Liu Yunlong. His wonderful performance in ""The Conspiracy"" made me feel idiot. He played the third in Hawthorn. After reading it, I realized that no one can interpret the perfect youngest. How lucky Jingqiu is to have such a man love her and pay for her. Perhaps I, born in the 1980s, cannot deeply understand the ideals and beliefs of their generation, but the theme of love is eternal, regardless of time and space. She is like Tsai Qin’s old song: Who is beating my window... , Come slowly, like weeping like a complaint... "
1	The Panglin Hotel is too busy for parking, and the room has a peculiar smell, especially after being separated from Hilton. 
0	Sweat?~~ I’ve mentioned something faintly in the city, I’m looking for 4 me, and the customer service doesn’t know how to guide us there, dizzy?~ The machine gets a lot of heat, and the CD-ROM reader is indeed a bit noisy (compared to high-end products) Wireless network card What kind of driver do you want to install, sweaty? 
1	The last one I snapped up to Shanghai looks good, with good configuration, fast startup and shutdown, almost no sound, and comfortable keyboard. There are two other surprises. One is that there is no camera in the product introduction and pictures. There is also a product introduction that says it is a combo drive, which is actually a DVD burning 
0	This broken hotel dare to say that it was newly renovated in 2007, except that the wallpaper and curtains have been changed, the switches, furniture, bathtub, and toilet are all old. The lights and TV in the room are from which dynasty, so Ctrip should give it to everyone. Gatekeeper. 
0	It is really sad for the Chinese people to be touted such a bad book preaching conspiracy. It is another fast food reading, as boring and nutritious as junk food. The writing is too poor, the story is very general, lacks depth, lacks ideological connotation, and the author's level is still too low. I guess no one will mention this book in five years 
0	This hotel is really amazing: 1. The background music with amplified sound from 7 in the morning until 11 in the evening, and it is always the same CD, it is crazy. My friend and I joked that the hotel should be for everyone All of the guests sent earplugs so that the guests would not go crazy. We moved the next day. Oh my God! 2, The photos advertised by the hotel are totally inconsistent with the actual. The photos show the rooms are super luxurious, five-star standard. Actually 3 star standard Except for the noise, the air conditioner does not heat at all. The door of the room cannot be closed. The hotel explained that the door can only be closed when it shrinks in winter. The TV cannot be watched. So the star rating of Pingyao is I can’t believe it. But if I didn’t come by myself, I really couldn’t imagine that the difference would be so big. 3. The coffee on breakfast is worse than instant coffee, and the milk is mixed with water. 4. The price is 780 yuan. Everyone decides to go. Don’t go live. Later we moved to Tian Yuankui. It’s a lot better and the price is cheaper. The waiters inside are also very good. Yun Jincheng is very popular in the local area, but the reputation is not good. We are not government officials. The people are not suitable for this kind of place. I have never stayed in such a bad hotel. 
0	I know that this set of discs sells well in Dangdang, but I still want to say that not only is the order of a good work bad, but the bad video quality is terrible. . . A lot of content is missing, oh,,,,, speechless,,,,, when will you be more dedicated to the original manufacturers in the six districts,,, 
0	I booked 2 rooms because one of the air conditioners was broken, and mold grew. I asked the waiter that there were no other rooms, and let us check out. So went to the front desk to check out. The next day, Ctrip's customer service phone said that we had booked two rooms and only one room, and the other room would be deducted (guaranteed by a credit card). I said that the refund was due to the problem of the room. I went to the person in charge of the hotel for the theory. The person in charge said that I don't care. I said the waiter asked me to refund, and he said that what the waiter said was invalid. That attitude. . . So,,, how many twists and turns in the back,,,, ah, almost missed the car back to Beijing. Fortunately, Ctrip was generous, and after the investigation was clear, the money for an extra room was free 
1	(1) Stylish appearance, unique keyboard and bright colors. (2) High cost performance. (3) Complete functions. (4) The heat dissipation effect is very good. 
1	I stayed in a deluxe double room twice in June and July. The room is relatively large, the facilities are a bit old, and the environment is good. It directly faces the Helong Sports Center and the Ferris wheel. Clean up when you're done, you don't need to be so short of time, it's obviously to rush people 
0	Terrible place. No one should live. The facilities are not good and expensive. Really bad luck 
1	Very good, although it dropped by 100 the next day after the purchase, it doesn't matter whether the workmanship is reasonable, and no memory is added. VISTA is slower. I bought it on JD for the first time, and the delivery was fast. I adjusted the delivery time twice, and the customer service was very patient (praise Panjiayuan Station) 
1	The workmanship is good and the performance is better than expected. I just used it and I am studying the functions of Samsung's own software. 
1	People who like the five senses so much, the five senses are so pitiful, although she wants to climb up, but her heart is very upright, people do not offend her, she does not offend others. Ying Tianlin looked down on her facial features when she grew up in a brothel, and couldn't understand her tricks, but because she saw Mo Han killed his mother and concubine when she was a child (see the 3 prequels of a Proud Prequel), the facial features are innocent. At first I hated Ying Tianlin, but seeing that he finally blocked the arrow for his facial features, I also felt that he really loved the facial features. It's just that Ying Tianshen is pitiful, waiting for his facial features, but fortunately there is still Li Gen with him. (See one of the pride of the city) 
0	There are only 3 USB ports, and 2 of them are too close to be practical. Mouse, keyboard, U disk, mobile hard disk, electronic key. Need more USB ports. The audio interface is in the front, which is not good, and it is blocked by any computer shelf. The battery life is average, more than 2 hours. 
0	There are only two towels for two rooms, and it costs 5 yuan to add one towel. Isn’t that too much? ? ? 
0	The battery seems to be far less than 8.5 hours, and the chocolate keyboard is a bit unaccustomed, and it feels very thin. 
1	Compared with the current similar ones, the price is barely acceptable. The whole is not exquisite, nor rough, it's passable. 
0	Very fashionable and humorous style of writing, there is the momentum of talking and laughing. Although I have only read the first part, the feeling of loving it has become stronger and stronger. 
0	Altec Lansing's speakers are worse than I thought, and the sound is lower, I don't know if I haven't adjusted it properly! 
0	Just renovated when I checked in, the smell is very strong! The bed in the room seemed a bit shaky to sit on! 
0	I started installing XP, but the driver was really hard to find... Finally, I gave up and installed Vista... Backed up with PE with Ghost... 
0	"Coming from Chongqing, it was already more than 5 o'clock in the afternoon when we got down from the airport. As a result, the room was not cleaned. It was OK for half an hour, and it was not good at 6 o'clock. It was 15 minutes. gosh! At 7 o'clock, it's not good, and negotiated with the main station, ""I can't help it"", and entered the room at 7:30. The aisle is dark when the elevator goes up. I really don't know how to get the 4 stars? Never encountered such a bad 4-star hotel. Strongly not recommended! ! ! "
0	The goods ordered on the 28th have not been delivered today. It’s always been like this, except for the expensive books, it’s faster. This time I only bought 50 yuan and it was too slow. 
0	The environment and facilities are not good, the rooms that were booked in advance that do not rely on the tracks were not reserved, and the sound of the train whistle all night affected sleep 
0	The courtesy of the front desk staff needs to be improved. They are not efficient. Because three waiters deal with one guest's problem at the same time, other guests stand in front of the service desk and ignore them, and the tone of speech is not good, cold, not professional enough. Meet the four-star hotel service. The facilities in the bar room are dilapidated, especially the bathroom, I think it is worse than Samsung, and I did not sleep well all night. The only compliment is Bell Boy, their service attitude is good, smiles are lovely. If you want to stay for 500 yuan a night, it is really not worthwhile. 
0	The hard disk cover and the main body are not tightly joined (that is, the end close to the optical drive), and there is a narrow to wide gap. It feels that it should not be intentionally left for heat dissipation. I don't know if it will affect dust prevention. Is it a mold problem? Does your machine have this problem? Or is it an individual problem with my machine? Thank you 
1	The environment is elegant, but there are many mosquitoes. There are only 20 or 30 killed by me. Among those who slip through the net, there are still boat-swallowing fish. The hotel has a pick-up service, but the driver sent to me recommended a chartered one-day tour to me the next day, which only costs 150 yuan. However, the next day I knew that this was purely a trap, and it was annoying to delay me a lot of time. In addition, the breakfast was very poor, the milk was made with powdered milk, and even the powdered milk was reluctant to put it, it was as thin as pot water. 
0	"It turns out that my impetuous heart prevents me from appreciating such a talent! Re-reading ""This Life and This Life"" is another taste. Zhang Ailing said that to use my name to promote Hu Lancheng's book, she can't help but avoid suspicion. However, reading Hu Lancheng is absolutely no regret. Not to mention that he used his love to float towards Qin Mu, but his talents alone made people unbearable to drive him into eighteen hells with a stick. Zhang said that men who have no conscience towards women are all serious and ashamed of him. Hu is an excellent sample. He called Zhang ""Lingshui Zhaohuaren"", with a few figures, and Zhang's realm is all out-aloof, sensitive, outstanding, but he can't escape the fence of the soul. "
0	The case was sent to feel dirty, but it was brand new, and the seal was no problem. The appearance is slightly different from the official one. Other friends have said that, for example, there is no basketball court or something, I don't care, it is not easy to get this price. But today I also sent anti-virus software, a little jealous, ha ha 
0	The heat dissipation is not good, it is a bit hot at once. And the system is very troublesome, and it has not been solved yet! In addition, the camera is not effective! 
1	The express delivery speed is really fast, the books are also very beautiful, much more beautiful than the photos! ! I like it very much, and my family is also very satisfied! It seems that Lenovo's things are indeed powerful. 
1	I haven't read such a book for a long time. After I bought it, I read it in a hurry. It is a rare and good book. It is comparable to Jin Yong when I read it, but Jin Yong's handwriting is more extensive and bold. A very man’s novel, and the description of emotions is so touching. In such a materialistic society, justice, sincerity, trust, and frankness have long been forgotten by people. I admire the protagonist and the author more. I am here for us. Midsummer dedicated such a masterpiece. 
0	Child's comment: Carmela has enough courage, and so are her children. Whether it is in heavy rain or in the surging waves, she is so brave! 
0	The small drawback is that the wireless network card has just been bought and the network is constantly disconnected. It seems that it has not appeared after updating the system recently. It should be a problem with the compatibility of the wireless network card driver and Vista. The computer always makes electromagnetic noises of nuisance for unknown reasons. 
1	This time I went to Quanzhou with three foreign guests and stayed in Quanjiu. The lobby is decorated with daffodils and has a delicate fragrance. The environment is very good. Checked in at a price of 390 yuan, great value. Guests praised the hotel as very good, I think this It is the same feeling of every staying guest. 
1	Brand new, authentic and licensed products, and the delivery staff are also very professional. The HP warranty information has been found online, and the price is not available in physical stores in Shanghai. It can be said that this is a mini laptop, not a netbook. Performance can be comparable to some notebooks. The best part is the six-cell battery, which can last for four hours when fully charged. I am very satisfied. 
1	The paper and printing of the book are not very good, but at this price point, the material and price are consistent, plus the movie vcd presented, although the effect has not been tested, but I believe it should be ok. I won't say much about the content of the book, and everyone who wants to see it should basically know it. I read this book 10 years ago. I was still a junior high school student and I really liked it. Unfortunately, the book I bought at the time and published by Yilin was lent to her classmates by my old sister N years ago. There is no news, and it has become a faint regret in my heart. After many days, it is better to buy another copy by myself. 
0	The hotel business is light, and there are not many guests in the lobby. The room is not small, but I feel that the bedding and curtains are all grey and smelly. Recreational facilities in the hotel, including swimming pool, billiards, etc., are charged. There is no air conditioning in the room during the day. The hot water at night will not come until it is left for 10 minutes. The advantage is that the location is good, it is the old street when you go out, and it is convenient for eating and shopping. 
0	Updating your own graphics card driver will cause conflicts between LCD lights and brightness, resulting in a black screen when the battery is turned on. Contact customer service to replace the original driver to solve the problem. Also, although the screen is 12 inches, it is a 13 inch machine... Silent, Samsung Lie 
1	The ultra-low price, I didn't believe it at first, it was so much lower than the quoted price of Zhongguancun, and I didn't know everything was true until I got the goods. 
0	This should be the worst hotel I have ever encountered since booking with Ctrip, and it was still 4 stars. The reasons are as follows: 1. The rooms provided by the hotel are adjacent to the window, and there is an overpass below. Although it is on the 10th floor, it is still very noisy, especially when commuting to get off work, it is like living in a food market. 2. There is no way to adjust the shower head in the shower room. You must be ready to enjoy a cold bath while standing in the shower room. 3. Sometimes the door will make a nervous alarm sound. It is estimated that the alarm is not connected properly, and it can’t be repaired. . 4. The elevator is too slow. 5. There are a lot of young ladies in the hotel, and they rush around all day and night, which is incredible. 6. Needless to say, parking is needed. You have to get a ticket to the front desk to stamp. Sometimes I forgot. I finally drove out to the door, and found that there was no stamp. The security asked you to pay the parking fee for everything. Also, when you come back from get off work, don’t encounter commuting. Otherwise, you will have to compete with cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians and even animals for every inch of the road (I really don’t know under the overpass How could there be such a traffic situation, just like a county town in China 10 years ago) 6, and gifts are tricky. Ctrip stated that there is a gift, which is actually a bottle of water. We just checked into the hotel, and the front desk manager of the hotel (known later) called and told us that most of the coke and oranges in the hotel refrigerator are free. Thinking of Ctrip's description, it's not bad. How can I tell us to spend 30 yuan after the checkout, because we consumed the drinks in the refrigerator. Later, the manager at the front desk said that he would only give a bottle of coke and orange. Think about it, I’m staying with two people, and I’m only allowed to drink one bottle. What kind of shit rule is this! A bottle of 10 yuan, let alone a free bottle, you can earn 3 bottles. I don’t know if Ctrip has participated, but the hotel insists on paying the bill and we are very uncomfortable. How can a star-rated hotel do this? When a customer disputes a hotel, the hotel has always taken the initiative to give in, cut it! Additional comments October 19, 2007: Seeing the following review, I immediately checked the credit card bill, and it turned out that the pre-authorization has not been cancelled, my goodness, 2400, even if it is frozen, it is really terrible! 
0	A typical rubbish hotel, very far from the Wangfu Hotel and Liwang Hotel of the same grade, poor service, poor facilities, I feel that the waiter in the hotel is God, as if I signed their money, check in At that time, the attitude is extremely bad for no reason, let alone smile, it is recommended not to live there. 
0	The V system is installed with 1G memory as standard, which is of course not enough. 
0	Low cost performance, outdated room facilities, small rooms can not be smaller, a bit like a prison. Service is average. Hotel Feedback August 8, 2008: Thank you for your comment. First of all, I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you by the hotel itself. On the Internet, the hotel has set up seven types of rooms with different sizes and specifications and prices for you to choose from. The size and internal facilities of the same rooms are also different. We will continue to improve the quality of our services, and look forward to your more valuable suggestions next time. 
1	I got it today and I’m trying it out. I feel good overall. I sent a zim external combo, but I haven’t had time to try it out. 
0	LINUX system is very bad, why not pre-install DOS? Due to the LINUX system, it is very difficult to install XP. It took a lot of effort and it took a week to get it. There are driver problems, which may be restricted by the installation order. There will always be problems after the first few installs of the driver. appear 
1	"The two brightly colored rabbits use their clear eyes to tell us the love of love, conveying the purest emotions and desires in their hearts, selfless dedication and joyful play, so that adults will be moved by their sincere affection and let Wu Wu Carefree children who have a strong sense of happiness deepen their attachment to love. My daughter said on behalf of the little black rabbit, ""Oh, it would be great if I could be with the little white rabbit forever!"" Her words made me understand the child's desire and attachment to love! Love can warm the heart and make life stronger and more sunny! "
1	The lavender + white piano paint is very beautiful, and the background lights of the five touch shortcut keys on the upper part of the keyboard are very beautiful! The accompanying software is relatively sufficient, there is a year of free anti-virus software, drivers and VISTA CDs are available. The 1.3 million camera is very clear, and the interpolation can be up to 5 million. The touchpad feels very good, and the transition to the holding area is very good! Fingerprint, Bluetooth, card reader, wireless, whatever you want, even modems that are not commonly used now... 
1	It feels average, not very cost-effective! Check out is slow, hope to improve 
0	When my boyfriend saw the introduction of the book in the newspaper, he was blown up, so he asked me to buy one for him. The Dangdang party was very fast, and I received it in three days. I read it. I'm just a rubbish book. Now that I have bought a book, I have begun to make a wonderful work, and it makes people not live! I think, it is better to go to some diet network to see that it is better than this book! 
0	After reading it for a month, I haven’t finished reading the book ads now. The content is very plain and the language is average. I don’t know if it’s a translation problem. 
1	I bought this book and showed it to my daughter. She is a freshman, but she has a mathematical mind, and she must read it every day. She has to win the book. Although there are introductions to fractions, rational numbers, and irrational numbers in the book, my daughter doesn't quite understand, but she will ask. After I explained it to her, she could get a general idea, knowing that the denominator cannot be 0, and that king 0 can only live upstairs (numerator) and so on. It is helpful for children to increase their interest in mathematics. Of course, it also benefits from people. I lent it to my colleague's daughter. Her daughter likes liberal arts but doesn't like math, so she has no interest in this book. 
1	It's really thin and light. It's no problem to fit an inner bag directly into the bag you usually use. The bags delivered are quite high-grade, and the workmanship is also good. After all, they are original, but it is not my favorite style, so I discarded it. Hehe~ 
0	1. There are no shortcut keys. All shortcut keys must be operated by FN, which is not convenient. 2. This is a SIS motherboard, not an original Intel motherboard, and does not support dual-channel memory. No wonder the price is relatively low. 
1	"Maybe it’s because I told my son too much storytelling and developed a habit that he doesn’t like to read. Recently, I’ve been slowly cultivating his own habit of not relying on adults for reading; I will listen to him, and now I will tell each other one, and this one, my son always chooses this book ""Story Treasure Box"". The content of the story is simple (but it is classic), there are few rare characters (not too few), and there are many big pictures (picture books, not complicated). For children who are just learning to read, what better choice? The likes of the son are the likes of the parents. "
0	I really don’t like this kind of little woman living a life that she thinks of being a petty bourgeoisie. Every time she thinks of the scene of Shanghai at night, it is not very comfortable, only a decadent feeling. 
1	I checked all relevant information about the CPU on the Internet, the configuration is good, 57 popular configurations, currently ranked 18th, very cost-effective. 
1	I bought this book after being recommended by a friend, and I think it is very good. My daughter is 5 years old, and she likes popular science books. This set of books is currently her favorite book. She shares all kinds of interesting knowledge with me every day. Now I am watching biology and I am particularly interested in the whales. I personally think this set of books is suitable for children in the lower grades of elementary school. Children in kindergarten may need to be accompanied by their parents to read. They are very knowledgeable for both adults and children. Very good, like it! 
1	I started with 4899 and gave away a bunch of things. I haven’t used it for a few days. I’m not very clear. I feel pretty good initially. 
1	According to the second edition of this series of picture books that my daughter saw in the kindergarten, I searched for the second edition, bought this one, read it quickly, and loved it. So I bought the first album this time and I still like it. 5 years and 9 months, all read independently, not allowing parents to read. So she finished watching it alone, laughing while watching it. I was infected by her and I saw it again: the picture was really good. The font is a little too small, it may not be good for the eyes to read it for a long time. My daughter has read these 6 books at once. I feel that her eyes may be affected a bit. It is better to take a break after reading one. 
0	The machine didn’t find any shortcomings, but JD’s service seemed to be poor. The payment was completed on the 5th, and the order was only completed today. 
0	There is a bad smell in the packaging of the new machine, so I sniffed it carefully. It’s from the inner bag. I got the balcony tonight 
0	This book disappointed me too much. I didn't write it in depth at all. It felt like I was advertising for myself, and I would never buy this kind of book from China. 
0	The rooms are small and the decoration of facilities is not as good as that of the sister hotel next to it, but the prices of the two are actually the same. The service attitude is relatively average, the buffet breakfast is in the bar on the first floor, which feels relatively poor. To be honest, I discovered that there was a magnificent cemetery behind the hotel. I immediately wanted to cancel the reservation, but the hotel had to deduct money (according to Ctrip), so I had to stay a night away. Pity I am going to Hong Kong this time with my girlfriend, we will never stay in this hotel again. Additional comments July 10, 2008: By the way, the number of this store is also quite weird. Perhaps it was the reason why we saw the cemetery at the back first. After going upstairs, there were no tickets on all the doors and no number plates on the front wall. We all had a chill with our backs... Fortunately, I quickly lowered my head and found that the number plate is... …On the threshold stone on the ground, my waterfall Khan-too scary 
0	The room is covered with cheap stone tiles like a restaurant, and there is a dirty carpet between the two beds. There is only a thin mattress on the bed, and the springs on the mattress will be on you at all times. The water from the sprinklers always has only two temperatures, extremely hot and extremely cold. It is inconvenient to travel and the location is rather biased. Many drivers will not go to take a taxi from Jiefangbei. All in all terrible 
1	Overall it's okay, the environment and air are good at the side of the scenic area, but when we went there was still being rebuilt (it seems to have been expanded last year, why is it so long), the environment is compromised. The head of the third floor of Lijing Building we lived in seemed to be Room 319. The window was right. I don't know what computer room it was. There was a buzzing noise, which affected the rest. After talking to the service desk, I changed the room. The restaurant dishes have few varieties and average taste. After the reconstruction is completed, it should be a good place to live. 
1	The CPU is powerful and has most of the technology of T400, which is not comparable to SL400. There are also Bluetooth and DVD burners. 
1	1. The problem of education is first of all a problem of concepts. Of course, old people generally have the problem of backward concepts, and quite a lot of young parents are still not advanced enough because of the influence of old education methods. 2. After mastering the more advanced concepts, it is important to see how parents grasp the scale. This varies from person to person, from child to adult, and from adult to adult. Third, the last and most important point is to persist in applying advanced concepts in the education process. This is common. 
1	The appearance is stylish and the configuration is fine. Tokyo delivery is very fast. I ordered the goods on the afternoon of the 10th and paid in installments, but the delivery was made on the morning of the 11th. 
0	It’s okay to read the introduction of this book, but it doesn’t read very well. Many words are very boring. 
0	1. The shipment from Tokyo was not as fast as expected. I waited 7 days before waiting for 2. This machine is the vista nemesis. I tried all the activation methods but it was not activated. Asked him how to get Lunix, but he didn't know. Also said that only for one year 
0	It's a bit thick, the screen is 8.9, but the mold feels like a 10-inch model, and the drop makes the screen smaller. With a strong plastic shell, it feels a bit like a toy. In fact, if the mold and the motherboard are further reduced, they can be upgraded to a higher level, and of course the price can be increased. 
1	The hardware is sufficient, the graphics card has been tested, and 3dmark06 is around 2100, which is ok, generally enough, and the speed is not bad 
1	For the battery and the processor, I basically chose this one without hesitation. The keyboard is also very unique and easy to use. 
1	If you don’t know who Jack Ma is, let me tell you, Taobao is his, Alibaba is his, Yahoo is his. Jack Ma led Alibaba from ordinary to success.

0	The configuration is not balanced, 1G memory is definitely not enough to run VISTA, and it will be stuck after opening a few software, but now notebook manufacturers love to match this way, it is really speechless. It is appropriate to redo XP. There is also a CD without VISTA, which is always a bit inconvenient. 
0	The worst hotel, there is no sense of service at all. I booked a hotel for a friend and said that it was possible to pick up the plane at the airport, but I did not receive a call from my friend and did not even call me. My friend came back from a foreign country. I couldn't contact her. She just stayed at Jinjiang Inn next to the airport. I called the hotel more than 11 o'clock in the evening, and the other side said irresponsibly that the person had not received it. Maybe the plane was late and promised to say my friend When I arrived, I called me, it was completely nonsense!! I suggest that everyone don't stay in this hotel, it is too bad!!! In the end, no one received it, but I was so embarrassed to call me and ask for money later, it was really bad!! 
1	The appearance and performance are good, and the price is relatively reasonable. This time the delivery speed is very fast, like one, ha ha 
1	When I bought this book, it was when I had some emotional knots. Although it has been a long time, there are still some emotions in my heart that cannot be calmed down. After reading this book, it really helped me a lot. I can analyze the problem objectively and rationally. It is not recommended for friends under the age of 20, because many things can only be experienced after real experience. Some people say that this is a kind of brainwashing, but it is wrong to think so. I think this is a process of finding the best combination between sensibility and rationality. The reason why people mature is because we will continue to experience it. 
0	The bathroom in the room is poor and unsatisfactory. The general feeling is not very good. However, the hygiene of personal products is still very standardized, neat and packaged. 
1	The room has free fruits every day, which is better. There are also many books and photography works in the room. It is said that the chairman Heqing wrote and shot himself, so talented. 
0	Needs to be improved. When I put the laptop on the table, I found a grease stain, wipe it off with a towel, and then found a stain on the right side of the rail under the table, which can’t be wiped off, but it looks uncomfortable and the air conditioning effect is very effective. Poor, hardly hot, only cold wind 
1	The battery life is good. It took nearly 2 hours and about 40%, which is much better than X200 with 4-cell. Samsung DDR800+Samsung SATA 160G, 
0	The driver is more difficult to install. When I am tired, the repair rate of Asus seems to be a bit high. I hope I am a lucky one and don't run into such things. 
1	The two plots of this book that made me almost cry. Both have nothing to do with the relationship between Yujin and Yinzi, but the family relationship. One time, Yujin fell into the water and woke up, her sister Yukui cried, and the other time she learned that her sister was pregnant and the whole family. Happy. Of course, Yujin's affection for Yinzi is also very heartwarming. There is no such summer, how can the past be repeated? When Dangdang released Yishu's collection 1-45, then 1-80 was released. Why didn't it sell 46-80? Let me buy 1-45, dry and piecemeal buying follow-up, which is not human at all. 
1	The environment is not bad. On the West Street, there is a considerable distance away from the noisy West Street, which is very quiet. However: 1. No Internet access, which does not meet the four-star standard; 2. Traveling companions complained about the musty smell in the room 
0	After reading this book, I feel that there is not much value. There are already many books on this topic, so I haven’t finished reading it. It is only suitable for chatting topics. I really don’t like it very much. 
0	The decoration inside is too old, the toilets and bathrooms are not very clean, all the taps in the room I live in are not working well, there are many phone calls at night, and the service is relatively average 
1	I have forgotten to review after checking in many times. Now I have to make up all of them. Haha. The hotel has a record of my frequent guests. The thing forgot to be in the room, even if it is a small mobile phone battery, the hotel takes it seriously and immediately contacted me. 
0	Is it too hot? When I came back, the body temperature of the machine was speechless. I comfort myself because the weather is too hot 
0	I accidentally ordered the best plan twice, but I bought two copies of it, and it was troublesome to handle the return, so I bought it to my classmates, hey! ! ! 
0	Not as good as it was when it opened. The carpet in the room is dirty, the internet speed is very slow, and the operation of the TV is very inhumane. The floor drain of the shower is very slow, and if you are not careful, it will flood the Jinshan! The price of massage and foot therapy in the hotel is to let you go once and never go again, and it will always encourage you to increase consumption items! ! There are also advantages, that is, the girl at the front desk check-in is indeed very beautiful, ha ha. 
0	Stayed at this hotel on the night of January 10, 2008, the environment is very good, very quiet. I can’t remember the specific room I live in Woxianlou, it seems to be 3115. Starting at 22 o’clock, I think the room is very noisy. After looking around, I found that my room is separated from the next room by a door, and there is a big underneath. Gap. The noise came from next door. I don't know who is living next door, the music is loud, or disco music. In addition, there seemed to be a lot of laughter from men and women. Unbearable, I called room service. Later, a service staff went to the next door to report the situation, and then the next door converged slightly. But after a while, the situation remained the same. I wanted to rush to argue with it, but when I was single, I endured it. In this way, sleepless night. It directly affected my work status the next day. Here, I strongly protest, and hope that in the future, no discordant people will go to the hotel. 
0	The right wrist heats up a bit, and the fan sound is a bit loud in the quiet night. Vista is really difficult to use. If you change XP, you must change the APCH mode of the hard drive to IDE. I don’t know if it can’t give full play to the performance of the hard drive. 
1	The appearance is beautiful, the performance is super, and it is no problem to play 3D games. I added 2G memory, which is quite cool. 
0	The sd slot has no bezel, the memory is too small, and the others have not been found yet (just 4 days), and the price is reduced by 100 yuan 
1	The front desk service is poor and not considerate of customers. A friend came to clean the room, but it was not cleaned after calling for two hours. The sewer in the room was stinking, and the bathroom leaked and blocked the water. 
0	1. The service is poor, it might be better to speak English 2. The room facilities are old and poor, the worst is the bed. Same as the guest house 3. The traffic is far from the subway but there are more buses. It is convenient to take a bus. You can take the A22 to Tsim Sha Tsui, which is more convenient and faster than the subway. It only takes 20 minutes. Additional review March 5, 2008: 1. The service is very poor, and it may be better to speak English 2. The room facilities are old and poor, the worst It's the bed. Same as the guest house 3. The traffic is far from the subway but there are more buses. It is convenient to take a bus. You can take 26 (A22 is the airport line) to Tsim Sha Tsui, which is more convenient and faster than the subway. It only takes 20 minutes 
0	The palm rest is hot, and the touchpad is easy to touch by mistake. There is a Bluetooth logo under the touchpad, but there is no built-in Bluetooth. The screen color is normal 
0	Use the evaluation of a professional elite to express your views on this book: the readability is not bad, and it is particularly fresh for students who have just entered society. But to some people who have been working for many years, it seems very numb... 
0	The package is opened. The barcode on the outer package is torn off. There is also a barcode on the inside. But the machine is okay. After reading the evaluation, many people are like this 
1	"The happiest reading is that the books you read and your own life experience have the same results! Often when I am reading a book, I want to make a sensation. When I thought about writing this book, the author was in 1983, and my own psychological development, from 2000 to 2009, actually fulfilled his theoretical explanation in many places! Reading his book is absolutely beneficial to friends who are psychologically confused or who are striving to improve their psychological personality! Hundreds of times better than the ""Ivy League One Year Old"" I bought at the same time! "
0	I placed an order to buy on March 24, but yesterday the text message told me that the delivery was beyond the scope of delivery and no delivery. Now the money has been paid, and I still don’t know if I can get the things. Call back and say I don’t know about this, no Know what Dangdang. What courier I found, really bad! The customer service line is always busy, I don’t know what I am doing. Can anyone tell me when I can get the book!!! 
1	The price is super high, and the performance is really good at the same price. The function is complete. Don't pick and prick everyone. 
0	1. There is a bright spot in the middle of the screen and a bright spot in the lower right. I heard that the highlights of Area A are unconditionally replaced, and I am applying for replacement, waiting for the processing result, and the progress is updated at any time! 2. The machine is a little leaky, and it feels tingling on the hand. 3. It took a day to install XP. 
0	There are countless books in Dangdang, but this one is the most rubbish, with hundreds of pages in all, but only three or two pages are useful, and anger cannot be expressed in words. 
0	Out of touch with reality, the product of white-collar YY reads like a running account. I really don’t know how this book became popular. 
0	The built-in system was at a loss and didn't even enter, so I had to re-partition it. The drive disk is not xp, so it cannot be opened directly. The driver downloaded from the official website failed to drive the sound card and wireless network card, so I don’t know what to do! The camera pixels are average. The keyboard is flat and feels not as good as IBM. 
0	"I bought a copy of ""Du Lala's Promotion"" on Dangdang.com. On page 51, the fifth line from the bottom read: ""Left is just a temporary agent..."". Should it be: ""It's just a temporary agent""? Please forgive me for my shallow knowledge. If my understanding is wrong, please forgive me. If there is a typo, is it a problem with the original book? "
1	The sound of the machine is very small and the LED screen is also very bright. I added a 2G DDR667 memory and I did not expect that it can also form a dual channel ~ heat dissipation is not bad. 
1	"Li Yaoce's writing skills are beyond doubt. Whether from his short story or his novel. It gives people a novel feeling. But I personally prefer his short stories. The narrative skills of the story are more clever. The long story shows that the author has worked hard to explain, but can not get rid of the heavy pile of a lot of empty text. But as his first novel, he is still very careful. I look forward to breaking through articles like ""Love Novels"" and ""Your Story and Life in the Life of the Story"". As a fan of him, I still support him as always. "
0	"When the CD-ROM drive is running, the sound is relatively loud. The graphics card is relatively low-end, not as good as my GF7300GT graphics card. It took me a day to change the system and install the driver. Now there is still a ""network controller"" hardware. It's hard to use the power adapter and it's hot to the touch "
1	It finally arrived. After waiting for five days, it is not easy! The packaging is good, take it away, take your time! 
1	Dual-core, Samsung DDR3-1066, AUO LED screen, independent display, satisfaction, and a perfect screen in hand, not bad. 
1	"The room was very big, and everyone was taken aback. There is a supermarket and snack night market opposite, and there is a bakery next door, which is very convenient. From the passenger terminal, directly take the No. 1 bus (departure station) to Carver. The name of the station is ""Shaolin Hotel"". It only costs 2 yuan to ride a bouncing car. The facilities in the room are good, but the side facing the road is also noisy, and the parking lot on the inner side is also noisy. Breakfast is the standard of the factory canteen, so I only score 4 points. "
1	Remind everyone that it is best not to go to Hong Kong in October every year, it is much more expensive than usual! 
1	Read the reviews before buying a book. Some buyers said that there are too many words and words in the book. The baby doesn't like to read it, but the ending is unexpected and interesting. I bought it with the mentality of giving it a try. When I opened it, my son liked it very much (though this book is more suitable for little girls to read). My son is four years old and is in the active literacy stage. He keeps pointing at the words that appear on the page with his little hands. He doesn't feel bored, and he likes the fruits, vegetables, aquatic animals, etc. inside. It should be close to life experience. My son really likes this book. A good book is worth recommending. 
1	From the title to the cover are so attractive. ENO. The faint watercolors and the faint but deep feelings in the text complement each other. Perhaps we have more expectations for the impossible feelings in life, whether it is love between men and women, or between men and men. Love that's why we will fall in love with this book. Fall in love with the protagonist in the book. Even if we don’t appear next to us, the words accompany us. We are always looking forward to it. 
1	It’s been a long time since I bought it and I haven’t watched it. It took two days to finish reading it! I don't know what kind of mood it was after reading it! The entanglements of the second generation and the bizarre stories are really incredible. I fell in love with Zheng Woo’s gentle character at the beginning, and I liked him even more after reading it. At least I realized the mistakes I had made and tried my best to make up for it. I didn’t dare to try new love easily so I always clean I love myself, and when I have someone I like, I go forward courageously, a very persistent person, I like it! Jiao Jiao's writing is great! Looking forward to new works! 
1	2300, I think many people buy it at a much lower price than this price. The girl rushes to rush and doesn’t wait. This price is relatively cheap compared to other products. 
1	The express gate is installed ~~~ The boot is fast~~? If time is pressed~~ This thing can help a lot~~~~ 
1	The appearance is very beautiful. At first I thought it was not as good-looking as the pictures posted, cost-effective, and the effect of playing games is also good; and the heat dissipation is quite good, maybe I used to use HP laptops more, HP is hot! ! The voice of the book is also very small, very good! 
1	I really like this kind of kraft paper cover, simple, plain, without any bells and whistles. It seems to be the kind of fan publications before, a bit retro. It's a thick book, and it feels good in my hand. I was reading this book on the side of the sports field that day, and a sister-in-law came over and saw it and asked: What book? After reading the cover, I was surprised to ask: genuine or pirated? After getting the affirmative answer, I asked again: Why is it printed like this? I don't know what to say. Leisurely heart will, the beauty is difficult to tell you. 
0	I bought a set for my 6-year-old daughter, as well as the latest seventh volume. She liked it very much. She had read the book from other students in the kindergarten, but she still hugged it when she got home. It seemed really good. I am going to buy another set for my friend’s child 
1	I started with 5699. The price is very good. The appearance is good. The interface is rich. The heat dissipation is very good. The configuration is very high. I use enough. 
1	"I did a test today, and the result turned out to be a type B personality. At the time, I felt that it was not reliable. Obviously this girl is very A? It was not until I found the ""Type A person"" manual that I felt that it was finally understood:) I heard that most of the Asian population are type B people, and friends without exception seem to be in the scope of B , B-type people's lively, B-type likes to show off, in fact, A has suffered a lot. Sometimes, in the society of type B people, type A always seems a little weird, too silent, and very sad. So, when I picked up the type A manual, I was so happy: "
0	Qianhui has not seen the book arrived in the past half a month, and has not seen any reply. I feel deceived when buying books online in Dangdang. 
1	"Special Xiaodoudou~ kind, understanding her mother~ great principal~~ these are my favorite three people~·Japan has developed very rapidly after the war, of course this is inseparable from their education, although I am particularly not I like Japan, but I have to admit that Japanese education is really awe-inspiring. As a teacher student at the school, Mr. Kobayashi Zongsaku is my role model. I think that after I get employed, I must do my best to promote Mr. Kobayashi's educational philosophy and even open a ""Ba Academy"" by myself. "
1	I have stayed a few times before, but because of a new renovation recently, I made a latest evaluation, evaluation date: 2008.02.23 Advantages: 1 equipped with a computer, I stayed in a business double room and a single key is equipped There are computers, although the configurations are similar, but there are still differences between the two: Business double room computer: permanent power supply, do not let you log in to QQ, MSN and other business single room computers: remove the key and automatically shut down, you can access QQ, MSN, etc.2 There is a personal private cabinet to keep personal valuables. 3 A bottle of purified water (Coca-Cola Water Forest 550ML) will be given to you every day. 4 Convenient transportation. There is a foreign goods market next to it. (You can exchange breakfast coupons with the front desk) 2 The computer has a hacking password (this may also be the reason why the business double room computer does not allow QQ, MSN, etc.), and the hacking ability is very strong, and it will be stolen in 5 minutes. Fortunately, I have a secret security , So it is strongly recommended that you must use the soft keyboard to enter the password when using QQ 3 The room is small 4 The room is older from the outside 
1	At this price, the configuration is very good, the price is very favorable, and it is a big brand, there is no problem with daily office 
1	Beautiful appearance, good performance, and very good running XP. The screen is super bright. The first time I bought Gateway, it was recommended by others, but I didn't expect it to be really good. 
1	What is moving is not the words in the writing, but the story of the combination of these words. Life has gone through so many changes, transformed into a vicissitudes of back and depended on each other for life. Is it optimistic? Not really. It's just a state, a living state, without judgment, only narration, the past will eventually pass, continue sadly or remember it truly? No one can dominate everything, no one can not bear the changes in life, but after experiencing it, can you still stand up to meet the bright sunshine and silent night... 
1	The environment is beautiful, the waiters are enthusiastic and generous, and feel at home. Next time I go to Fuzhou, I will still live in Yushan Hotel! ! I still can’t forget the breakfast there @_@ 
0	When I first ordered this set of books on Dangdang.com, I told my son that I had ordered a set of books for him. There was a car in it, and there were a lot of nice things to do. My son was very happy. After the book arrived, he liked it very much. It’s because I really like this book when I turn around. I look for golden bugs in it, and I don’t want to sleep at night. 
1	After I got the things, I found that it was much more beautiful than the Jingdong pictures, it was dark blue, I like it very much!! The workmanship is also good. The perfect screen. The power supply has not seen how hot it is! 
1	I bought this book after I read the book’s recommendation after seeking medical advice. I didn’t know much about the content of the book at the time. After I bought it, I read it all at once, and I’m going to read it a second time. The theory is relatively simple and credible, and I agree with it. After I learn it, I will start to implement the health maintenance methods. I believe that I will see results in the future. Although I am not very old, under the influence of my mother, I attach great importance to health preservation, and my target audience is quite convinced of this book. I think it’s good and can read it. 
1	The hotel room is not bad, the big bed is very comfortable. I slept soundly at night, but the computer provided in the room was not available, and the lobby environment was less than the four-star standard, but it was a bit higher than the Samsung. Additional comments July 20, 2008: The hotel room is not bad, the big bed is very comfortable. I slept soundly at night, but the computer provided in the room was unusable. The hotel environment was less than the four-star standard, but it was a bit higher than the Samsung. 
0	1. Hotels with integrity problems. Ask at the front desk that the price is much cheaper than online booking. Then, if you know that you ordered online, you will change your account immediately, and then you must use the online price to settle (since online booking is guaranteed by a credit card, there is no way). Was pitted. 2. There are a lot of mosquitoes in the room. 3. The hot spring is not very clean. I went to soak at 8:00 in the morning. The water just changed is still very dirty. I don't understand why there are so few people and it is so dirty. Compared with Kaiping and Yangjiang, the hot spring facilities are only 10 years behind. 了; 4. The hot spring is on the side of the mountain and the air is good. 5. The restaurant is okay. It does a good job early. Compared with several other food stalls, the price is very close. It is also good to eat in the restaurant. Additional comments October 7, 2007: A little less to say: 6. The hotel does not have POS machines and does not accept credit cards, which is very rare. 
1	Jingdong’s order processing speed has improved. This time the service is not bad, but this time the unexpected surprise is that the product description is 250G memory, and actually got 320G. In addition, a VISTA CD is included. 
0	It feels like this life diary. The author has created a very free and detached feeling of Ji Shiliang doctor, but for someone like me with a background in science and technology, who has a good background in literature, history and philosophy, I feel that there is nothing behind the text and it is empty. Fortunately, I didn’t buy the second volume together. 
1	1. The overall hardware configuration is quite good. The CPU graphics card is particularly prominent. It shows 512M alone, which is quite good. 2. The appearance mold is also a bright spot. 
1	Stable operation, light sound, simple appearance. The design of the touchpad is better, integrated with the entire surface, and easy to clean. 
0	Don’t catch a cold on the system you want to install, from installing strenuous 01, bios camping mode, the ide network check linux to change XP and some should not be ide 02, set the bios CD to boot 03, put in XP disk 04, continue to install 05, put in Provide driver disks to install one by one, ok 
1	"Coincidentally, after watching ""Brushing the Hippopotamus"" in advance, I hid in the toilet and cried. After going to high school, I was nervous in school and my grades were not satisfactory. The hopeful self who was full of hope for the future seemed to disappear overnight. I know how cruel the pressure of competition is now, but when I saw Andre admit that he ""cannot be the pride of parents"" in front of my mother, I cried. All children in the world want to be the pride of their parents, but when we are sober I have to admit that I cannot be their pride and cannot refuse to be a mediocre person. It’s really cruel. "
1	The appearance is simple and generous, the configuration is balanced, the various random software is very easy to use, the manual is very clear 
0	What are you doing? How would you recommend such a broken hotel? Also five stars? Samsung at best. Checked in on January 7th, 700 yuan bed room can not access the Internet, I changed three rooms in a row, and opened up for an hour after midnight...Which bathroom? Alas...not even the guest house. Are the towels and bath towels rags? The elevators and aisles are full of the smell of a hot pot next door. If you say five stars, it is actually a few floors of hotels in the office building. 
1	I lived in a river-view room, the room was large, the environment was first-rate, and the price was not high (258 yuan for 2 breakfasts). The disadvantage is that the service is a little bit unable to keep up, and it is generally good. 
0	The money was also paid, and the bookmaker couldn't wait, and finally found the customer service phone number. It turned out that the book was gone. The money was suddenly returned, and the unit found it to be bribery, and there was no proof. sad. . Dangdang has been in the business for so many years, and your president also medias every day. The service is still not detailed enough, or I can go to your customer to take care of the customer service. I must have bought a better book than the current one, and finally bought it. . Try it next time to Excellence to see if the service is as bad 
1	Our attitude towards statistics is like treating leaders or parents. They should be trustworthy, because they have a lot of truth to tell you, whether it is experience or knowledge, they think it should be right, but just like leaders We also make mistakes. When statistical data is not reliable, they will also appear on the wrong occasion at the wrong time. How we still follow our usual words, that is, we are too pedantic. After reading this book, you will be more Doubt the authority of the data, and often maintain this suspicion, because deception is increasing. 
0	I wasted my RMB. What I read on the CD-ROM doesn’t match the words in the book.-It’s always missing one. I’m really angry... 
1	This is the second time I have stayed. Because of the need for a business trip, there is indeed no other place to live in Anqing. The overall environment of the hotel is elegant and the room facilities are average, but the hygiene is okay. After each stay, I am used to check whether the bed is tidy. During a recent business trip, only this hotel did not find any foreign objects such as hair remaining on the bed. 
1	Overall it is good, but the service attitude and standard need to be further improved 
1	"Back then, I was struggling to chase articles in Jinjiang because I saw that a lot of clear clothes were worn by one person without close sisters, so that there is no need to spend a lot of time outside, and the same can be viewed from a different perspective. I also thought that after the college entrance examination, I wrote a two-person crossing at the same time, and then I saw ""Qing Meng Wuhen"", exactly what I thought, so I like it very much "
0	Check-in No. 10-3: The bathroom is very bad and smelly! Ctrip is suspected of deceiving! 
1	When I was about two years old, I have read recommendations on Dangdang and bought the Crackling series and the different Domera series. I feel that the crackling baby is not very interested. Maybe after that age, Domera will have to look a little older. Now the first episode of the Tom series is very suitable for babies over two years old. The pictures are warm and the dialogue and story are very close to the reality of life. My baby likes to play with sand. The episode of going to watch the sea talked about the last time the sea washed away the sand castle, and the baby was also very sad. He seems to resonate with Tom's emotions in the book. I feel that the baby likes it is the best. It is recommended for babies around 2 years old to buy as soon as possible. 
0	The overall heat dissipation is okay, but the touchpad is a little hot. It took a long time to charge today, the power-on button seems to be leaking, and my fingers feel a little numb. It’s okay to unplug the power and use the computer at night when charging. It’s strange... 
1	1. The price is low. 2. The mold is acceptable, not very low-grade. 3. The configuration is relatively balanced, Pentium dual-core, burn CD-ROM drive. 
0	I installed linux, but the manual teaches windows to use it. There is no linux instruction, and no reminder of the precautions for reinstalling the system. My rookie almost had to take the new machine for repair when it was not used. 
1	Staying in a mini standard room for 260 yuan. It feels much better than expected. The room is suitable for one person. The bathroom is large and clean. The quality of the bedding in the room is very good, as clean as new. The windows of the room are glass curtain walls and cannot be opened for ventilation. This is the closest hotel to Dalian Railway Station. The front desk service attitude is very good, very enthusiastic and skilled in business. When checking out, the rounds are relatively slow, and when there are many people, you have to wait a few more minutes. The overall feeling is ok, and the traffic is extremely convenient. 
1	Lin Yutang almost wrote Su Dongpo alive, and wrote a flesh-and-blood Su Dongpo, a peerless genius, an aura and a lovely poet. After reading this book, I closed my eyes and felt Su Dongpo right in front of my eyes. It seems that he was shaking his head and chanting poems and writing words...but it is a pity that I personally feel that the translation is not very good. If it was originally written by Lin Yutang in Chinese, then it would definitely express Lin Yutang's original intention better. In addition, Lin Yutang wrote the original version in English, mainly for western readers. Some questions can be deeper and more comprehensive 
0	It is not a quality problem, but a common feature of netbooks, that is, the small fonts and the long viewing time on the screen are particularly troublesome. Used to listen to music, watch movies, send emails, write things, and manage personal accounts. It's okay, but it can't be used for office work (too hurts eyes) 
0	There is a pungent smell in the hotel, especially in the aisles, but the hotel is under renovation. In addition, the accumulated points confirmed with the hotel before check-in also found an excuse afterwards that the room rate was too low to accumulate. I do not recommend staying at this hotel. 
0	Regret! ! The price is more than 500, the room is generally tolerable, the service is terrible, especially the front desk, the efficiency, the expression on the face-a little professional quality, OK! 
1	The service of the hotel is good and the rooms are clean. After asking to go online, I changed a room with internet access, and the internet fee was not charged. The transportation is convenient, with Dalian Railway Station at the door. I thought it would be noisy, so I can live on the 17th floor, but I can't hear the sound at all. The cost is more than 200 yuan, which is very worthwhile. 
0	"I bought several sets of the book of traversal. I saw the review of ""Man Man Qing Luo"" on Dangdang.com and bought it and read it. After reading the article, it was really disappointing. The writing was not so vivid and it felt too simplistic. On the contrary, I prefer the book ""Scary Step by Step"", which is also through o(∩_∩)o... "
1	The price of summer business suites is 780, which is slightly higher. If it is usually more than 600, it is reasonable. But in general, compared to the so-called four-star hotel suites such as Harbin Huaqi and Huarong, the room The color tone and configuration are reasonable, the area is not big or small, 45 square meters. In addition to Shangri-La, Harbin, but the room is too small, the Gloria Garden Hotel on the riverside is good, the Fushun Tiantian in the development zone is OK, and the rest is Jingu No. But although its newly renovated room is very modern, it tastes too big, otherwise, it should be ranked second. 
1	I bought it for my colleague and it was not bad. You get what you pay for! This configuration is worth the price! 
1	A very deep story, as exciting as a movie. Beyond the limitations of personal love, joined the discussion of social issues. The love and the inability to love, the contradiction and passion, and the self and the destiny of a generation are interspersed and connected. Each other becomes an indivisible whole, and then. There will be a lot of people who don't understand but seem to understand, and there will be a desire to understand but hope to understand. It is to display to the readers the essence that is objective but transcends the appearance, without comment. Different people may have different feelings, perhaps just from different details. I like it too much. 
0	I bought this book with expectation, and I regret it when I get it! It is extremely unsuitable for children. The pictures are a bit distorted and terrifying. It is easy to cause psychological shadows for children. It is still a good book that is more sunny and clear for children. It is recommended that when Dangdang recommends again, please select carefully. ! ! 
1	I got the computer and installed the memory stick by myself. This is pretty and stable, the keyboard is very comfortable, the camera is very clear, and the mouse is very beautiful. You can also make a mirror. 
1	When I checked in, it happened that the POS machine at the front desk was broken, and I had to pay cash in advance, which was a bit inconvenient. But the restaurant on the first floor is really good and cheap and worth a visit. 
0	"It is very close to the sea, but the decoration of the room is not very new (sea view room, Building 1), old-fashioned hotel, old-fashioned service. Suitable for convenience, but not picky about room facilities, friends who are not too demanding added comment September 3, 2006: The so-called ""sea view room"" (additional 90 yuan) outside turned out to be a trash can. , Brooms, mops, and a balcony where the cleaners dry their pants, followed by a woods, and the sea in the distance. I wonder if this room is called a ""sea view room"" or not? The musty smell in the room is heavy, and it’s not very useful to open the windows for half a day. Some wall corners have mildew spots; the cleanliness of the sheets and bedding is very average, better than that of small hotels, and the beds don’t look very flat, but Stay alive while sleeping; two sets of pillowcases, the upper one is still white (but there are stains that cannot be washed off), and the lower one is slightly gray; after entering the room, dissatisfied with the musty smell and the so-called ""sea view"" and proposed to change the room. The middle-aged man evaded many times to no avail, and promised to have a check-out change, but later told him that no one checked out for a day. The management level is very average, of course, compared with similar small places, the speed of completing the procedures is very slow, there is no management system in the front desk, and it is actually word, so use excel! This kind of under-managed hotel suggests that ctrip be delisted, or how can people believe you in the future? "
1	1 The screen effect is very good, bright, and high saturation; 2 The keyboard is special, I like it very much, and it feels very comfortable; 3 The appearance is very stylish and the business features are strong; 4 The overall performance is very balanced, suitable for office, games, and Internet. 
0	Slightly heavy, the fan and hard disk are a bit sound, especially at night when it is quiet, and the Linux system is inconvenient 
1	First of all, it should be said that Ctrip's services are in place, which provides a lot of convenience for me. Secondly, I will talk about the good places of the Yangtze Island Hotel: 1. The location is really good. Nothing to say. It only takes less than two minutes to walk to Jiefangbei. There are many things to eat, buy and see around. 2. The waiters are very enthusiastic, especially the doorman, which is affirmed by many people. 3. The facilities are relatively complete. There are paper pads next to the toilet in the lobby (this should be a poorly done place for many others). Of course, it should also have a lot to do with the lobby on the seventh floor. 4. The house price is adjusted according to time, Monday is cheaper than Saturday. Focus on the deficiencies: 1. The booking information is inaccurate. Originally, when I booked it, I said that there was no double room, so I ordered two standard rooms, but when I checked in, I was given a double room without prior notice; 2. The double room was not as big as the standard room, and it was quite different; 3. The room There was a peculiar smell when I first entered, although it is not obvious; 4. Most of the top cover of the boiling water pot is damaged; 5. There is no hair dryer in the bathroom, which is separately equipped. There is a problem with the socket in the bathroom where I live. The hair dryer can only be outside. It works, but there is no mirror outside; 6. The waiter came to turn down service at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it was too early; 7. There was a problem with the safe, and it was impossible to use it according to the instructions. The waiter and I played according to the instructions. I couldn't use it for a long time, and when I had reported for repair, it suddenly recovered. 8. There is only one faucet, no dedicated drinking faucet. 9. The fire exit is not clean. As for the slow elevator problem that some friends said, I personally feel that if you don't take the sightseeing elevator, the speed is still OK. In fact, most of the viewing rooms cannot see any view because of the location limitation. There are high-rise buildings around, no way. 
1	Staying at this hotel for the first time, overall it looks good, the room has been upgraded, the room feels very warm, staying 
1	"I think that if we want to distinguish justice in the world, then this book can tell you, from who sees the world, the world is normal, and that is a child. When reading this book, ""Nanjing! Nanjing! ""It's being staged. We have only taken the first step in our reflection on the war; here, the child uses her eyes to tell you the tragedy brought about by war. Extreme nationalism and clamoring justice will deal a devastating blow to the world. Things that are as beautiful as words will be used to promote extreme ideas and to blind human eyes. So, reject war and cherish peace "
0	The bathroom is very small. The internal facilities are not humane, especially the hot water facilities are obviously in poor contact, and the patch panel behind him is underneath, which is not convenient to use. 
0	The views of this book are a bit too objective and too realistic! Not in line with mature women's outlook on life! I don't like it very much! A bit disappointed! 
1	Lightweight and very light. I already have a 14 laptop. It’s inconvenient to carry. This one can be taken out at a low price. I never thought I could buy an IBM X series under 10,000 yuan 
0	"It turns out that my impetuous heart prevents me from appreciating such a talent! Re-reading ""This Life and This Life"" is another taste. Zhang Ailing said that to use my name to promote Hu Lancheng's book, she can't help but avoid suspicion. However, reading Hu Lancheng is absolutely no regret. Not to mention that he used his love to float towards Qin Mu, but his talents alone made people unbearable to drive him into eighteen hells with a stick. Zhang said that men who have no conscience towards women are all serious and ashamed of him. Hu is an excellent sample. He called Zhang ""Lingshui Zhaohuaren"", with a few figures, and Zhang's realm is all out-aloof, sensitive, outstanding, but he can't escape the fence of the soul. "
1	Piano paint, streamlined body, concise and generous, noise control is very good, speed is very fast, the screen is great, the display effect is not to say; the keyboard feels very good, and it is very comfortable to use. High performance-price ratio, dual-core independent display wireless high-definition also has not fallen, belongs to the all-round mainstream book, really great value. 
0	The double bed room has a computer to access the Internet (but the carpet is dirty), as well as food and daily necessities at your own expense; the standard room is relatively clean. I saw insects crawling in the bathroom twice. There is no food and daily necessities at my own expense. No computer to go online. The lobby manager's ability to handle things is extremely poor! The people who stayed in our group felt dissatisfied overall, and the price/performance ratio was too low! 
0	The equipment in this hotel is very old, not like a 3 star hotel. The room facilities are like 80's. 
0	Because everyone's comments are good, so I bought it. But...what? It's almost...very...how to put it...helpless...not as good as I thought... 
1	Because the Yuehua Hotel has no rooms, I decided to set up the Quanzhou Hotel through Ctrip. Although my favorite is Yuehua, in fact, I feel that the decoration and style of Quanzhou Hotel is better than Yuehua, that is, the service and breakfast are worse than Yuehua. 
0	The driver of the wireless network card is not easy to install, and it is more troublesome to install XP~~ But it is very cool after installing~~ I also found that one disadvantage is that the sound of the computer is relatively sharp when it is put outside. . . 
1	This set of picture books is very suitable for 1-3 year old babies. The pictures and text are very concise, which can give parents and children a lot of space. Some people may think that the content is too simple and a bit repetitive, but for a little baby, he can't take in too much information at once, and moderate repetition is more helpful to her memory. The baby especially likes to read the toothbrushing book in it. Combined with seeing adults brushing their teeth, I find it more interesting. We take this opportunity to rinse her mouth and brush her teeth after drinking milk every night. Recommend to everyone. 
1	I have been on business trips almost every month since 2006. I have stayed in many hotels in Shanxi. The one that impressed me most is Sanjin International. Others include Dragon City International, Huayuan Hotel, Yellow River Kyoto, and what is the traffic building? Yes, let me make a true and accurate review of these hotels below: Sanjin International-this is the hotel I think Taiyuan is most proud of. The most direct measure of a hotel is what services you can get. In this hotel, I felt the care at home. The first time I came here, I caught a cold, and the waiter heard a word in my mouth, and then boiled a bowl of ginger soup to my room. Of course, it was free. I was very touched; I fell down accidentally while taking a bath, and the deputy general manager, director, etc. all sympathized with me. Actually, this is not entirely the hotel’s fault, but since then, I found that every room’s bathroom is equipped with anti-skid Mats and plastic slippers; once I put socks in the bathroom, who knew when I came back I found that the waiter helped me clean it for free, and glued my beloved comb that I accidentally broke. Yes, and left a message to me. It really surprised me and I couldn't believe it! For a person who travels frequently and has a particularly tight time, check-in and check-out are the most annoying time, but I have counted it. The check-out and check-in time at the front desk of Sanjin International did not exceed one minute! ! ! It's hard to get such treatment in Beijing! Needless to say, other things, such as front desk reception and lobby service, are really good; of course I also have suggestions: 1. Can the hotel quilt be changed to a thicker one, it is cold in winter; 2. Some rooms have no telephones Hands-free, not very convenient; 3. Outside calls can't come in, maybe the hotel is for safety reasons, but I still hope to have the function of outside dialing. Dragon City International-I don't know who gave the five-star rating? ! The hotel is average, not as good as Huayuan Hotel. What can't be tolerated is that the receptionist attitude is too bad! The only advantage is that the breakfast is delicious. Huayuan Hotel-It was good in 2006 and 2007. I stayed here occasionally today and found that it took a long time. The pillows and quilts are not very clean. The others are quite good. The service attitude and environment are good. The breakfast is a bit simple . The Yellow River in Kyoto-the place is too off! It looks pretty good. It’s not good to live in. What is intolerable is that I also remind everyone that it took 29 minutes to check out. It was almost half an hour. I almost fainted! The attendant at the checkout just called and ignored me. Traffic Building-a nightmare hotel, I will never live again! ! The soundproofing effect is too poor, and unfortunately, I heard the secret words of the young couple next door. Haha, what made me sit in the nightmare is that I didn’t know which unit came to round the room in the middle of the night and took away many girls from many rooms, so I was afraid To say...there is a white girl wearing glasses at the front desk, her attitude is really bad, depressed! There are still many hotels in Taiyuan. I may not stay here one by one, but I still hope that all the hotels will be like Sanjin International, giving Shanxi people a long face! 
0	We booked 4 rooms in Marriott on the Internet, which indicated that we arrived at noon, and we arrived on time. The front desk said that the room was not sanitary and had to be done later. So we went out for lunch and came back at 2pm. Room, the front desk said that the sanitation has not been done well, and only 3 rooms can be provided. We lost our temper. Can we do it for two hours? So the front desk changed us to another room that was already done. We need to lose our temper. We are here to travel, not to lose our temper. Obviously it is not a five-star, but five stars are marked on the sign, and then the five-star fee is provided, and the service and facilities of the two-star are provided, one word: bad! Additional comments October 8, 2007: It was marked to arrive at 12 noon, we also arrived on time 
1	The workmanship is solid, and the appearance is more suitable for business people. The business machine with this configuration is still very cost-effective. 
1	"When we see the excellence of other children, we are often envious, and sometimes we can't help but blame the child: ""seeing other people"", but have we thought of his mother's efforts behind the scenes? Reading this book is really helpful to myself. Many of the examples mentioned in the book actually happened to us and our children. Different processing methods have very different results for children. From the book, many of my thoughts have been changed, and I also affirmed some of my parenting thoughts. A very good book. "
0	The waiter has a terrible attitude! ! ! I didn’t say I lost the order, but I found an excuse for the shift. The front desk clerk rolled his eyes when the guest complained. Additional comments June 10, 2008: I lost my order and made several phone calls. Ctrip and the hotel pushed the ball, and the front desk and the reservation office of the hotel pushed the ball. The attitude of the front desk was still quite bad. I will never stay in this hotel again! ! After reading the previous reviews, it seems that this is not the first time that an order has been lost. For this kind of hotel that does not take the order seriously, Ctrip has also included it as a partner. If you want to keep it, you must strengthen the monitoring. Book! ! ! 
0	1. It's a bit heavy; 2. The driver download is too troublesome. I downloaded it all, 1.5g. After installation, the small question mark of the hardware is gone, but I don't know if it is the latest and most matching one. How to confirm this? 3. The memory is a bit smaller, and the standard configuration is 2g, so you don't need to upgrade yourself; 4. It is said that the chipset is not good. 
0	The special room has no windows at all, the air is very poor, and the room facilities are also very poor. The original restaurant private room was remodeled. When booking, Ctrip did not inform about this situation at all, very angry! ! ! ! 
1	The floor was too slippery, and the child fell after coming out of the bath. Fortunately, it was fine. Hotel feedback June 23, 2008: Hello, I am very happy to see your review again, thank you for choosing the Ambassador Hotel again. The hotel attaches great importance to your valuable comments, and the hotel will study solutions to the problem of slippery bathroom floors .I hope you can feel our improvement next time you stay! We look forward to seeing you again! I wish you a good mood and smooth work! 
0	The location of the hotel is fine, the facilities are too old and too old! The room size is too small and the hardware facilities are bad! The pillow is too low! The mattress is also hard! 
1	The Asian Games Village area, at this price, is still quite good. The transportation is convenient, the restaurant downstairs is very characteristic (Taste Jianghu), full of customers every day, there will be performances after 8:00PM, it is quite good, you can't take up a seat when you arrive late. 
0	do not know why. My daughter just doesn't like this book. She always ran away when we watched together. It seems she doesn't like this kind of illustrations and messy style. I don't like such books either. The picture is not very realistic. I don’t even know how to teach her many English words. Maybe it is more suitable for children from abroad. 
1	The service is good, but the room, especially the toilet in the north facing room, is offensive, it is recommended to improve 
1	A very cost-effective one, good configuration, enough for development, and added memory, the machine is very fast, the surface of piano paint is also my favorite 
0	(1) The memory is a bit small. (2) The included mouse is too small. (3) It is found that sometimes, drag the mouse on the desktop, there will be a delay. The reason is not clear. 
0	"I forgot to mention that the front desk service was poor. After lunch at Motel’s self-operated ""Merrill Little Chef"" lunch, there was a pack box. I wanted to temporarily send the front desk out to buy a pack of cigarettes. The guy at the front desk said not to store food. I went back to the hotel and turned over all ""Customer Instructions"" without this item. Instead, I asked customers to send valuables to the front desk. Is the packaged abalone counted as an item? "
1	"Support Ergou, support ""Twenty Years of the Underworld"" and hope that more people will see good legends. "
0	Fingerprints are too easy to stick! Pre-installed Vista is really rubbish. There is only one partition, which is very troublesome. If HP can sell this computer with XP, it can sell it for 500 yuan more! 
1	The hotel has complete facilities and good service. Very close to the sea, suitable for a walk at night 
1	A few colleagues asked me to buy this book. Everyone thinks it is very practical, especially for parents. Old people like it. 
1	"It took 10 days from ordering on the 11th to ""General Express Delivery 4 Days"", and I have never been in a hurry! I finally look forward to it. I can’t wait to open the box and see the baby I bought. It proves that I am quite discerning. I don’t have to say about the appearance. Compared with Lenovo, Asus, I feel that they are a material toy. I tried 720P HD, CPU usage. 80%, there is no problem. I haven't tried it at 1080P, and it is generally unnecessary. The battery life is generally 3 hours and I feel very satisfied. I have basically not found any problems now, I am not very demanding! Ha ha! ! ! ! "
1	I bought it when I was engaged in events, the price was reasonable, and it worked well with 1G of RAM. I like IBM's simple and steady appearance and stable performance. 
0	The stories are too long~~ and some are a little incomprehensible~~ I don’t like it~~ I can’t read two books~ 
0	After receiving the book, the first feeling was that it was dirty. I flipped through a few pages and found that there was broken paper inside. I pour it! Some pages still have dark footprints. Don't you confirm when the staff sent the book? ??? 
1	Checking in this store in the early morning of rainy night, it feels hard to find, and the apartment building where I live is also harder to find. The room is crowded but the function is complete. I feel that the hotel's airport shuttle service is very good, although I was awakened several times along the way! Ha ha 
1	"I just got this set of books a few days ago and I feel really good. The story inside is close to the life of the child iz. My daughter is 2 years old and 7 months old. As soon as she got the book, she kept asking me to tell her. Each story can bring us different feelings. Just after reading the book ""Frog's Search for Treasure"", the baby has been learning the dialogue inside. ""Hey, who's in it? We are trapped."" Sometimes she would follow Frog's words. I was sad and asked me to comfort her. This set of books can really make children feel real friendship, and the dialogue inside is also very suitable for children to imitate. "
1	"First, let’s review some of my comments on September 14, 2007-""The only thing I feel more relieved is that I don’t have to squat or bend over to pack my luggage anymore-after my previous N complaints, the hotel has finally added to the room The luggage rack..."" However, for the ""Deluxe Room"" booked this time (that is, the ""Executive Room"" on the 6th floor where I stayed N times before), I couldn't find the luggage rack again, and I was speechless for a while. . . This is too disrespectful to old customers, right? ? ? ! ! ! I don't know how Yinfan manages customer information, but in some hotels, if you check in once, there will be customer information in the system. The next time you check in, the hotel can make corresponding arrangements according to the customer's preferences in advance. . . If the luggage rack is not the standard configuration of the ""Deluxe Room"", at least I know (of course, if the hotel's system does not keep records, then I will not ""know"") I am here, somehow I will arrange one temporarily. . . Alas, I don’t know if we should apply an old saying, decayed wood cannot be carved. "
0	As soon as I bought the computer, I found that I could not connect to the Internet on the home ADSL. For this reason, I struggled, and I deeply felt that JD’s telephone service level is really poor. One is that the call is basically unreachable, and the other is that the customer service staff is just perfunctory. Lenovo's service staff is not bad, but unfortunately they can only call during working hours. 
0	The content of the book seems pretty good at first glance, but when I look at it, I find that the whole book basically talks about the same truth. 
0	The heat is too big, and the weight is not well controlled. It's not bad to buy this configuration for less than 5,000. The design of the new mold is much more beautiful. It is more beautiful than the T series, and the sound quality is improved a lot. Unlike the T series, it is just a broken gong. 
0	Very general, the service attitude is not good. When I left, there was a sealed carton box that needed to be taken down for help. I first checked out at the front desk and asked someone to help take it down. In just ten minutes, the room round waiter did it without authorization I took apart my sealed cardboard box and looked at the contents. When I waited for the doorman who was helping to take the cardboard box up, I was very angry and questioned the waiter. The waiter was still eloquent and convinced. I don’t know if there are valuable things and I just took them away, but luckily it’s just some information. 
0	High fever, no so-called ECO, serious microphone delay, no Type II PC card slot. . . 
1	The hotel is very good value, clean and hygienic. It is especially worth mentioning that when we checked in at the front desk, the waiter saw us with a child and offered to propose that the hotel has a double bed room with a single bed, and the price remains the same, the service is warm, thoughtful, and the price Reasonable, really good choice, I will definitely choose him next time I go. 
0	I took a look and it was not very useful. The author seems to be a non-professional person, and his amateur writing is published on the Internet, which deserves encouragement. 
0	The room layout is simple, the bed and quilt feel cheap, the air conditioner is extremely cold and the temperature is not well adjusted, so I can only turn it off before going to bed, but I still have a cold because of this, and the breakfast quality is very average. I will not go again in the future. . 
0	The rooms are relatively old, there is no smoke-free floor, the business room and the meeting room are together, the environment during the day is very poor, the breakfast is very simple, not to mention the service attitude, the service quality alone is very unsatisfactory, most of the guests are Individual travelers are not recommended to stay in China for meetings. 
1	It is cost-effective and saves a lot of overall costs, especially for general purposes (document editing, Internet access, etc.) MM is more suitable. 
1	The language of Du Lala’s promotion is simple and fluent, the main line is clear, Lala’s stubborn temper and intelligence, and focus on doing things leave a momentary impression. The workplace secrets have benefited me a lot. But the second part gives people a bad feeling, trivial, without a theme, Lala's wisdom is gone, and his attachments are gone. The book thickens, but the flashes are fading. In the final story of Qi Haotian's visit to Guangzhou, Lala didn't know that the plot was too unsuccessful. Lala was not only an HR, but more importantly, she was also the chief executive. How could the chief executive not know when the president visited? It doesn't make sense. 
1	Having said that, this time when Dangdang mailed the book, I encountered the same experience as that friend. My book is incomplete in Chapter 12, Chapter 13 is not complete, and Chapter 14 is repeated, making me feel , How should I say, the loss is not small. 
1	The appearance is very beautiful and the workmanship is very delicate. I bought it for more than half a month, and there were no problems. It was too troublesome to install the system. I changed more than a dozen system disks and crashed after I installed it. I thought it was a problem with the quality of the machine. I consulted JD.com and ASUS official website. It turned out to be a software problem. JD.com was very patient in overcoming the problem and was very efficient in solving the problem. It is commendable! 
0	"To be honest, theoretically speaking, not to mention that seeking medical treatment is better than seeking self-seeking. However, many times we can only turn to others for things that we cannot accomplish by ourselves. If we are sick, we can diagnose and treat ourselves. Of course, it is very good. How many people can do this, especially when they have a serious illness, can they not seek medical advice? Because of my poor health, I bought the two books ""Seeking a doctor is worse than asking myself"". However, I found it difficult for me to implement it. There is no way, I can only go to the hospital and go to the hospital. Still have to seek medical advice. In the process of seeking medical treatment, I gradually learned some common medical knowledge and accumulated some common medical knowledge. that is it. "
0	I don’t like this book very much. My daughter is 5 years old. I think this book is not suitable for Chinese children. One of them is a vocabulary book for learning English. If you want to teach children, parents must have standard pronunciation. This is good for foreign children. In other words, it is a literacy book under 2 years old. It is meaningless. If you want to learn English, similar professional textbooks are much better, and there are many plots that are different from China's national conditions, and children cannot understand it. 
1	The New Century Hotel is really good. I have stayed at this hotel for the second time. The hotel room has been transformed into a new single room. It is also equipped with an LCD computer and a fax machine. Next time you come, you don’t need to bring a computer. This time just in time for the opening of the swimming pool, the surfing in the indoor swimming pool is very good, I suggest you come and enjoy it. 
1	"My classmate recommended me to read. She knows how to live, knowing what we should do, compromising or fighting against some things. Although we are still students and are not familiar with the life of white-collar workers, the book ""Dulala's Promotion"" gave me a glimpse of such a real life. It is not blindly innocent and pretending to be stupid. It is the true wisdom of life . Du Lala, you let me know that the white-collar life is not the cruel and cold-blooded legend, nor the romance and fantasy in the idol drama. You have given me a piece of sea, and it is my business to tell me how to steer in this piece of sea. "
0	My baby boy is four years old. Children don’t like this series of books very much. It may be because of the cultural differences between the East and the West. As an adult, I feel a little unacceptable in the storyline. Like a chicken with teeth 
1	The room facilities are hard to reach a five-star level, and the service is not bad, with fruit delivery. 
1	The battery is strong enough, and the bottom is not protruding. The speed of running XP is acceptable, and the fan noise is not too big. 92% keyboard typing is smoother. The matte screen does not reflect light, and the eyes will not be sour after a long time. 
1	Although the mandarin of the explainers inside is not too standard, they speak Taiwanese Mandarin, but this does not affect the understanding of the explanation, let alone the effect of yoga. 
0	This score has always been particularly high. I don't know why, but I bought it and found that it was all meridian diagrams. What kind of cancer cells can become ordinary cells? . I'm so dizzy. 
1	This book is really as small as the introduction said, with a lot of content. There are many examples, and the effect is not discounted. The operation is fine and the work is unambiguous. Comprehensive knowledge, covering many fields. Portable, learn and use at any time. The price is low and serves the readers. It is a valuable and cost-effective book most suitable for beginners to read. Not only adults can understand, but also children and family members. In fact, this book is truly easy to learn, understand, and use. The editor's design makes people admire it! The books he wrote are as practical as teachers teach by hand, and are worth recommending! ! ! ! 
1	I really didn’t expect that every time I carefully selected books for my son on Dangdang.com, he loved it very much, and this time was no exception. He likes to whisper very much. Every night before going to bed and after getting up in the morning, he will definitely pester me to give him. Read; whether he is crying or playing a game of war with his dad, as long as I say a little whisper, he will put down the things in his hand or stop crying, and say: Mom, you will tell me the little whisper now, I like it very much. He is familiar enough to memorize the book. This is really a very good book, the color of the picture is a bit poor, but it is worth recommending to everyone! 
0	The sound is loud during operation. I don't know if it is the hard disk or the fan sound, but it is acceptable. In addition, it is a bit small and heavy, but the computer is not old. So you can also install a root memory stick and plug it in yourself. VISTA does not dare to delete it easily, for fear that it will not find the driver after installing XP. Wait until VISTA can't stand it 
1	When the heroes had not yet been born, even before the Fengyan Dynasty, Chenyue was at its peak, Tianluo entered the imperial capital for the first time, and the armored Tianqi warrior silently insisted on his belief. There is always that kind of power that pushes ordinary people to perform extraordinary legends. Their stories are not legendary heroic deeds, nor mysterious rumors, but just a guardian of people close to them or who have only one side. To this end, they are willing to give everything. Such people will always exist, and such beliefs will never die. This is the spiritual source of future heroes. 
1	I have read almost all of San Mao's works and think this is the best. In fact, I love each one. The lives of Sanmao and Jose in every place and the keen and delicate feelings of friends for every place make me feel that in this life, there are many possibilities. We can still have dreams. One day, we can also go wandering, footprint or heart. Thank you for life, thank you for a woman named Sanmao 
0	The soundproofing of the room is really bad. I live in the most expensive one. Someone surfs the internet next door. I can hear the prompts that their QQ friends are online. I did not fall asleep until three days in the middle of the night. For four hours, I heard the waiter outside holding a loudspeaker yelling for the resident in a certain room to get up. It was like a soldier in the army who called a soldier to get up in the morning to do morning exercises. There are strange things! Wouldn't you call their room to wake them up? Why do you have to use a loudspeaker to call a person, making the whole building unable to sleep! ! ! I encountered this situation the first time I stayed at Home Inn. I will never stay at Home Inn for free in the future! ! ! Hotel feedback July 31, 2008: First of all, thank you for choosing our hotel! The hotel attaches great importance to the problems you have reported. First of all, the hotel does not have loudspeakers and other equipment. Moreover, according to our wake-up procedure, it needs to be done twice. Wake up on the phone, if no one answers the phone, we will send the waiter into the room to wake up. So we are also very shocked that what you said will happen. But no matter what the reason, we are deeply concerned about your unpleasant experience during your stay. Apologies! At the same time, we will further strengthen the management of the floor to ensure that guests can truly feel warm and peaceful during their stay in the store! 
0	I have bought the book for a long time, but I have never read it. I occasionally read a paragraph and find that I have no perseverance to read it. It may be that I still have a certain understanding of Ming history. I cannot agree with the author’s use of networked and popular language. Interpretation of Ming History. Especially this morning I saw CCTV's interview with Mingyue that year. I think the host has reservations about this. 
0	"I bought 10 books in Dangdang this time. Among them, my ""Parents Are the Best Doctors for Children"" and ""The Wisdom of the Elderly Don't Get Sick"", and two of the ""Seeking a Doctor Is Better Than Oneself"" have uneven cuts. Fuzzy. Many words in the book are not clearly printed!! I thought that these books are worth reading, so I bought genuine products to collect, but I didn't expect Dangdang to sell counterfeit goods, which is even more high-quality than Taobao. It's worse, and the price is two or three times that of others. Last time other colleagues bought ""Wisdom Not Sick"" on Taobao, and there was no quality problem mentioned above! Although it is free of mail, the cost is high, but You can't buy fake goods to sell, and then increase the profit! It's really annoying! I advise consumers to think carefully before buying! "
0	The driver is not equipped with a Windows 7 64bit driver. After installation, let Windows 7 install it on the Internet. After the installation, the effect is not bad. The performance score is 3.9 points, and the lowest score is desktop effects. The CPU score is 5.1, which is not bad. 
1	Good value for money, it seems that the people of Anhui RMB and Jiangsu are much better 
1	My daughter is six and a half years old, and she reads a little bit shallowly, so she will finish her reading in a while and put it aside. But I find that she often turns up. My colleague saw me buying this book, took it immediately, and sighed as he read it: My daughter (four years old) must like the picture on it, and at the same time it cultivated her interest in mathematics. So he immediately ordered a set. Very good book. If I don’t receive such a fun and easy math enlightenment education from time to time, I won’t let my boredom with mathematics grow up with me, so that I will have to make up the exam for higher mathematics in college. 
0	1. It is inconvenient to install the XP system, you have to download the driver from the official website, and also modify the BIOS; 2. The notebook is relatively thick, and there is no advantage in weight and volume; 3. The keyboard is not good, and keys are often missed during use. I think it is a keyboard design defect ; 4. No gift bag, inconvenient to carry; 5. No Bluetooth. 
1	"When reading ""Tom Lost"" to Xiaoxiao for the first time, the little guy was very fascinated. When I saw Tom, who was lost in the mall, finally found his mother and hugged her, smiled and got up from the seat and hugged me. I can feel that she has been changing with Tom's emotions, and I can also feel that she is very afraid of losing with her mother, and feels very secure with her mother. This is a book written in the first person. The book describes in detail Tom's mental journey in the search process after losing with his mother. A very good book. "
1	Things are not bad, the led screen is very bright, the workmanship is relatively fine, the drawing is good, the price of 4399 is back and it is worth it. When I came back, I changed the XP system. The genuine vista was put aside and was no longer used. The system installation process was relatively smooth. lenovo's website has drivers 
1	In fact, everyone's comments on this book are very comprehensive, and my comments can only be icing on the cake. I decided to buy it after reading most of the book online because I wanted to digest it again. In addition, I bought a copy for my colleague so that she can also learn, and everyone can discuss and discuss together in the future. The books are of good quality, protected by plastic bags, clean and flat. Let me run another question. Recently, the quality of the books I bought in Dangdang is good, and the delivery is very fast. I kind of want to try to buy other daily necessities in Dangdang, such as a yogurt maker. 
0	It is strongly recommended that Ctrip cancel the cooperation with this hotel! Four rooms were booked for entertaining guests on the 14th. After the guests checked in, they found that the room had a strong pungent smell, which was suspected to be caused by the decoration. Four guests stayed in the room for about 2 hours, and felt breathing difficulties and red eyes. , I had no choice but to ask the store to change rooms, the front desk staff was very arrogant, insisting that no guests complained about the smell of the room, and that the rooms are full, it is impossible to change the room, and it is possible to check out but the room rate cannot be refunded. Later, the guest asked to check out and asked the relevant department to monitor the air quality. Only then did the front desk manager show up and adjust the room. This experience has seriously affected the image of the company, and I feel that the Olympics is imminent, and expressed concern about Guohong's service level. 
1	It is close to the company, so I chose this 3-star hotel. The price of catering is very competitive, close to ordinary restaurants.

1	I like it very much, and Jiefang North Road is also very beautiful, it is good to take a walk at night 
1	It’s the first time for me to buy books on JD. It’s true. The invoice is still a 17% value-added tax invoice. It’s been installed with XP for a long time. In general, JD.com is good. I bought my books on JD. , It's on the road, it's not safe. It's worth it! 
0	The location of the hotel is opposite the train station, with dense traffic and noisy environment, not suitable for ladies. When you check in, you should indicate that you live in the VIP building, and the room decoration is a little better. In addition, the efficiency of the service staff is relatively slow, and they should not be too impatient. 
1	1. High score screen with good display effect. The graphics card is not as strong as imagined, but it has been better. 2. Good heat dissipation and quiet fan. 3. The small keyboard is very convenient to use. 
0	"It was a colleague who strongly recommended this book. I see the online introduction and so many ""celebrity"" positions clamoring, and I feel that flicker is greater than the content. Colleagues were not reconciled and just bought it. . Sure enough, I yelled at it after watching it! "
0	1. The temperature of the air outlet is high and others are not hot. 2. The random driver is vista, without xp, it is inconvenient. 3. No 1394! 4. Express is changed from pcmcia, and the mold is not moved to save costs, despise! 5. Short standby, 110 document editing, 80 high definition. 
0	The keyboard is very fake! The camera is very blurry, estimated to be only 30W, it is really difficult to install XP system and its driver~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
0	Believe what you think is right in the book. If you think something is wrong, it is best not to believe it. If you believe in the book, it is estimated that everyone has early cancer! There is also acupuncture points that are not easy to find for ordinary office workers! 
0	The 16:9 screen feels a bit smaller, and the screen brightness settings cannot be saved after shutdown. Installing a few ACER EPOWER software to adjust the brightness has no effect, so I had to do it manually! ! 
1	The shell of the piano paint has a watery texture and it feels good. The configuration of this notebook is also good, and it is a reasonable match! Value for money! I installed the XP system and it runs smoothly, enough for general office use 
1	"Originally I just wanted to buy the ""Enlarged Book of the Great Yuding Inscription"", when I suddenly saw this book, I had a hobby of collecting, so I bought it too. After I bought it, I unexpectedly discovered that this book made me fall in love almost at first sight. The font is more beautiful and round and strong, while the big dingding is more square, sharp, and plump. However, the white plate inscriptions of Lingu Jizi by Wu Dacheng at the end of the book feel more majestic, but fortunately, it is basically not out of shape, unlike Wu Changshuo's Linshiguwen, which incorporates more of his own brushwork. The binding of this book is also fine, basically there will be a seam in the middle, except that the two original large inscriptions are still stuck in the binding line. "
1	I booked a superior room, because I don’t smoke, I was fortunate to upgrade to the 18th floor of the administration building. The room is large and the service staff are very friendly. It is much better than the Kowloon Hotel (the room is small and the service staff did not smile). I will come to live in Imperial Palace next time. 
1	The configuration is good, it is Xiao Hei, with Xiao Hei's excellent keyboard and calm appearance, the price of 4399 is really nothing to say. The quality should be more assured than other brands, and the user comfort is also good. Although SL is not better than other series, it is still very attractive machine. 
1	1. The hotel promised to pick up the plane. The plane was supposed to arrive at 10:00 in the evening, but it came out at 10:30 because the baggage was picked up later. The hotel waiter was already waiting at the exit, although I was the only one , But still very enthusiastic and sent me back to the hotel with a good attitude. really thankful! (The hotel is in the city center, and the airport is quite far from the city. The hotel’s pick-up is really convenient.) 2. The hotel is very tall (than imagined), the price is reasonable, and it is clean. I don’t know how the official rating is, I think It's a good 3 star supplementary review June 23, 2008: :-) It has been more than a month, and I still think the hotel is good when I think about it. It seems that if I go to HHHT again in the future, I will definitely stay here 
0	Breakfast is better than nothing! This is the long-distance bus station. You can imagine what the outside environment looks like! The people living here are more like transit passengers. I have seen nuns and monks! The room facilities are better than the guest house. Older hotels have fashionable names, but the hotels are really not comparable. There is a Milan club, probably a happy place, and a sauna and massage place. I don't need to say anything about it. Everyone knows what it is. The room phone rang at 10 o'clock every night. It's up to you to recruit or not. Let's weigh it up by yourself. 
0	Broken stuff, the writing is really bad. I don't understand why so many people give it 5 stars. Have you ever worked? 
1	The so-called mountain view room is just a non-sea view room. There is no mountain view at all. The sea view room does have a view. If possible, try to choose it. It's just that the curtains of this kind of room are not tightly drawn. The light comes in in the morning like a light is on, which may cause early awakening. In addition, the sound insulation outside the window is not good, and if the wind is strong, the sound will be obvious, which must be impossible. 
0	It’s the first time to buy a book in Dangdang. I feel regretful. It’s not as good as it is. The delivery speed is too slow. I haven’t arrived yet. I hope I feel better after seeing the book. 
1	"After the book arrived, I first looked at it roughly, and then told my son in sixth grade that I didn't have time to read, and asked him to ""help me"" read two or three a day. After reading, let him tell me: what kind of place these children live and what kind of life they are living; and then comment on which child introduces better, which child introduces not enough; finally let him talk about it, if it is introduced by him, he How will we introduce the place where we live, and will tell people what his life is like... Hehe, I really achieved my original intention-the child ""both...and... "",pretty good. "
0	This is an elementary school book. I used the method of storytelling in the past to write books. It is deeply loved by elementary students. As for whether middle school students like it, it is not known. As an adult, I am not too interested. 
0	When I saw the book, I felt that the content was messy at first. At first there were several pages of touted words, and then dozens of pages of nonsense. Then I will talk about this and that, and I have to rewrite the words in each paragraph according to a title. On the one hand, waste paper (if you want to emphasize that you can use bold printing), artificially increase the space, increase the number of pages, and increase the price. The content is not practical and feels fooled. 
1	Generally speaking, it is not bad, but the bathroom facilities are a bit poor, and there is nothing to ask for. Another thing is that the membership card seems to be too expensive. At least I know that Green Tree Inn is free of charge. 
0	The book is too shallow, too shallow for people who have married, and not very enlightening for those who have not married, and it is not worth buying. 
0	I originally planned to stay here for 2 days, but due to the extremely poor network, my online meetings were interrupted several times, which seriously affected my work, so I left in a hurry. The image of the guest room is very vague, and only an amateur IT makes me impressed! The decoration of the lobby is not bad, and the waiters are more enthusiastic. For those users who require high-quality internet, staying is not recommended. 
1	Good books should be shared with everyone. Even if you are not an art lover, you will be rewarded after reading it. I warmly recommend it to everyone! 
1	"When making a reservation, it is required to ""be facing the executive floor of Zhongshan Park""; the friends who have been introduced before have booked this way, and some have stayed for more than 2 weeks. However, when I booked through Ctrip this time, I could only say ""make arrangements as much as possible"", and I couldn't confirm it directly. I was a little disappointed! The room facilities are good, but small, and the scenery during the day is very good; the executive lounge on the 34th floor is free and very cost-effective! "
0	Please pay attention to your shipment. I received two identical fifth copies, but the fourth one is missing. It's really a shame that the entire set of books is scrapped. 
0	Obviously I bought 6 books, but only got 3, and I didn't say what the reason was. How can I believe it in the future? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 
0	Let me say the good thing first: the location is in the center of the downtown area, the room is OK, the price is relatively cheap, and the breakfast included in the 188 room is also OK. Bad: the door is a one-way street, I don't know how to drive in, and finally drive in the opposite direction , There was a policeman holding a camera to shoot, I don’t know if there is any winning. There are few parking places, the attitude towards the guest desk and the security of parking is very bad, the room facing the street is very noisy, the big speaker in the opposite shopping mall It's too harsh, the bathroom bath water is difficult to adjust, the shower curtain is pulled half-and-half around the shower, and the bathroom is full of water. 
0	Black shop! ! ! Check-out at 12:30 will add a half-day room charge. It's very horizontal and the room is dark! ! ! ! Older! ! 
1	Things are generally good. It is a 320g hard drive. With a camera, Logitech with a mouse, HDMI interface is relatively quiet 
0	As an executive-level member of Shangri-La Golden Circle, I feel like going home every time I stay at Shangri-La, but the series of low-level services in Zhongshan Shangri-La left me with a bad impression: 1. I booked a pick-up service at Zhuhai Airport. When I arrived at the airport exit, I didn't see the pick-up person (the first time I encountered this situation), I called the hotel to ask, and the car arrived 20 minutes later. 2. I booked the Horizon Club and checked in at the Horizon Club Executive Lounge on the 16th floor of the West Building, but arranged the room on the 6th floor of the East Building. It took more than 10 minutes to walk between. Staying in the Horizon Club is to use the lounge for convenience, why is it arranged to a far away floor, and I did not ask for my opinion. Moreover, the check-in procedure is the longest time-consuming of all Shangri-La hotels (I was the one who checked in at that time, it should take 20 minutes). The rooms are also old and smelly of smoke. I told me that it was an upgrade to a suite, but I would never accept it if I stated in advance. Moreover, the other Horizon Pavilion that was booked without upgrade was also arranged on the sixth floor of the East Building. What is it for? 3. There is a 88 yuan set meal for two for breakfast in the Chinese restaurant. I first ordered a few dim sums and asked the waiter that when my guests arrived, I would order a few more dim sums according to the set menu, so that the bill should be settled according to the 88 yuan set menu. As a result, my customer arrived, but the waiter handed him an a la carte menu, and a few other snacks were paid separately. As a result, I paid 150 yuan. Make this little money? Shangri-La has fallen! 4. Invoicing is required when checking out. If not stated in advance, two kinds of invoices will be given: one is hand-issued, and the other is fixed-rate tear-off. Why not explain it to the guests beforehand? The journey is not smooth! Shangri-La, which has always been beautiful, has fallen so badly in Zhongshan? Seriously upset! 
0	Talk about fairness? The whole book is buying advertisements, and everything is defending itself. Please, the housework will be settled at home, what book is there? He also gave a philosophical title to deceive people. 
1	The rooms are nice, bigger and cleaner. The breakfast was terrible, basically nothing good. 
0	1. The system is not an advanced version. Jingdong is misleading and a bit sad. 2. If I used Xiaohei before, the texture is not as good as before. 
1	Not bad, it’s a little troublesome to install the system, and it may take a long time for those who are not familiar with the system. 
1	I read this book when I was pregnant and gave birth to my son. Now my son is 14 years old and he is very healthy. My friend's daughter is married. I bought it as a gift for her. I hope she will give birth to a healthy and healthy baby. It is written by a Japanese expert. Pregnancy guidance, especially considerate and practical value. Every month the mother's body changes, precautions, changes in the baby’s belly and precautions, and the size are reminded. Especially: tell all family members, colleagues and friends, let them take care of you , Be a happy lazy mother, etc. Such words are really considerate. 
1	Most academic books have many professional and obscure vocabulary, but this book is different. The editor has a good match between professionalism and popularity. You will not feel like reading a novel and feel nothing after reading, nor will you be sleepy like reading a textbook, but will be very active in reading, and every chapter will have a certain gain. There are many quizzes in the book, which are also quite interesting. Whether you are a fan of psychology or not, you should read this book, because many of the theories cannot be regarded as profound knowledge, but common sense that should be popularized. 
0	This book is divided into three parts: easy, middle and difficult, covering a wide range of content. But not detailed enough, each unit has only two dialogues and one part of new words. The CD-ROM has been cracked when the goods are delivered and cannot be used. I don't know if I can find the download on the Internet? 
1	The guest has stayed several times. I think it's pretty good and hope to keep... 
1	Let me add two more points. I think Carlos’ success lies in the following three points, which are worth learning: 1. Choose the right person to help yourself-Renault help; 2. Have a strategic vision-choose the right cooperation Partners (Nissan, Dongfeng); 3. Must have the awareness of cultivating people-personnel exchange (Renault = Nissan); I admire the third point most, a successful manager does not lie in how high he is, but in I can train countless latecomers to success, make blood for the company, and make a good talent reserve for the long-term development of the company; 
0	It is really the least suitable hotel to stay in! First, the poor service attitude is not suitable for staying! Take a small incident at the front desk as an example: because it is from Haining, a customer came during the Tide Watching Festival and booked two rooms. First, the card was pre-authorized. At the checkout, it was said that the payment was not available. Change to another machine to directly deduct the payment. , I swiped the card seven or eight times before it was considered a success. (About 20 minutes before and after, there is no apology at all. On the contrary, it seems that I did something wrong and shouldn’t give her a problem) I told her to be sure Remember to cancel the pre-authorization. She said that it will be automatically cancelled after 30 days. Today, I received the bank statement and deducted the second payment. I have to negotiate with them. It's really annoying~~ Never again, Haining Hotel! 
0	The location is good, but the service attitude is not good. The decoration is pretty average 
1	The hotel attendant is really nice. I was intercepted by the heavy rain at the long-distance station and sent a car to pick me up after calling the hotel. The room is not flattering, it's too old and smells like. Overall the service is okay. 
1	The price is right, the quality is good, and it is good for business use. The appearance also looks very temperamental, look good~ Haha 
1	I bought it for a colleague. I like the beautiful appearance of the cow. The configuration is obviously higher than that of the notebook at the same price. The interface is very rich. I bought a HDMI cable interface and a full HD TV. It looks super cool! More value. The heat dissipation is good, not too hot. With camera and microphone, you can directly conduct video chat, card reader, compatible with common cards on the market, and the overall performance is very good 
0	The place is really partial, even the taxi driver has been looking for N for a long time. The room is very big. The facilities inside are outdated. As soon as I live in, there are harassment calls and tracking. It is really strong!

1	"Qingdao has a large number of Peking Opera fans and fanciers, attracting many former Peking Opera talents to perform at this ""big dock"". The ""Four Famous Danes"", ""Four Mustaches"", Zhou Xinfang, Tang Yunsheng and other Peking Opera masters have come to Qingdao many times to perform and received extremely warm welcome. As early as more than 80 years ago, Qingdao had a large box office and talented people. After many famous tickets went to the sea, they further demonstrated their outstanding talents. In 1959, Yan Shaopeng and Zhang Xiaolou's wife revitalized the almost lost art of the old students of Yan school in Qingdao, which produced great repercussions throughout the country. The relationship between Qingdao and Peking Opera is very deep and profound, and it is worth writing about. "
0	The CPU heat dissipation is too large, and no system can be installed under ghost. Only the pure American version can be installed step by step. 
0	A typical rubbish hotel, very far from the Wangfu Hotel and Liwang Hotel of the same grade, poor service, poor facilities, I feel that the waiter in the hotel is God, as if I signed their money, check in At that time, the attitude is extremely bad for no reason, let alone smile, it is recommended not to live there. 
1	The overall appearance is still good, that is, the bottom plate is black, which does not match the white of the top cover. 
0	Poor room facilities, a moldy smell in the room. The price is surprisingly expensive. The breakfast is poor. Compared with the Jihao hotel opposite, it is not competitive. It is not recommended to stay 
0	The hotel is relatively old, I heard that it has more than ten years of history and the rooms are relatively small. A so-called three-star hotel doesn't even provide disposable razors, it costs another 15 yuan to buy it. Generally not as good as the business hotels around the railway station. 
1	With original package, original mouse, 1G Samsung gold bullion DDR3 memory, 250G mobile hard drive, 6799 yuan to start. 
0	The location of the hotel is inconvenient, it is super difficult to take a taxi, the service is not in place, the hotel equipment is a bit old 
1	There is a bright spot, unfortunately; it seems that there are a lot of bright computers, and mine is in the middle position, very unhappy 
1	The rooms are okay and the transportation is convenient. Of course, the surrounding area of the train station is slightly noisy, but overall it is ok. 
0	It’s a joke, joining the author’s personal social activities, as a medical book, unprofessional, mediocre writing, a bit messy 
0	I can't start after changing 3 genuine XP CDs, let alone installation. I really don't understand. I have changed the SATA in CMOS to disabled as required. This book is useless, request a return! 
1	With genuine WIN-XP home version operating system, nationwide warranty. Avoid the trouble of installing WIN-xp yourself, use it at ease. 
1	"The most terrifying thing in this world is the human heart. In a huge car accident that happened suddenly, the survivors began to die one by one, and death did not let them go. Seeing this, I remembered a sentence I believed, ""There is no such thing as violent death in this world, only one is doomed!"" In this story, Shangguan Midnight uses very delicate and profound brushwork to explore the most hidden heart of human nature. Alluding to the most sensitive issues in society, under her seemingly calm and onlooker narrative, there is a hidden concern for humanistic care everywhere, calling for the return of truth, goodness, beauty and conscience. "
1	When I originally ordered it, it looked gray, but when I replied, it said there was no black. It was found to be dark when it arrived. It is different from the picture. But I just want this. The screen is perfect and I like the curved keyboard. The heat dissipation is okay. The sound is not loud. The built-in system should still be used. Hope others don't stop 
0	The stereo is completely rubbish, it is really unbearable. For people like me who don’t have any requirements for sound quality, they can’t stand it. You can see how bad it is. 
0	The kettle won't stop by itself, it gets hot and sprinkles a box of good tea! No results were reported to the waiter. 
1	I read 4 of this set of books: King of the Clan, The Last Guardian, Wheel of Hatred, and the Age of the Dragon. Although each has its own story, I personally think that this type of book is more suitable for people who like Warcraft and have a certain understanding. . Let people have a more comprehensive understanding of the history and world view of World of Warcraft. But in terms of magic, it always feels that the description in the book is very unbalanced. The translation is poor, not beautiful, and not smooth in reading. The story is not as good as the Lord of the Rings novels. The wheel of hatred is written more humanely, which is my favorite. 
0	After reading it all, I don't know how to tell the child. The first volume is a little hen. If you don't lay the eggs well, you go out to watch the sea. This is nothing in itself and acceptable. Later, the plot was that he encountered a little cock. He was very handsome, so he brought home and got married. . . . . . It feels that it is still not in line with China's ethics and morals. I hope buyers will think twice. Six of my own are brand new and sold at a discount. I'm not going to tell the kids 
1	Needless to say, thinkpad series, and also give away 1g memory, the temperature control is very good, the noise is not too big, the optical drive spins very hard, but it is acceptable 
0	It's a bit heavy, but it's stylish. It is perfect to have an operating system. I just bought this one, and the T6600 model is only 4799. I feel that this model should not be as good as that one! 
0	The hotel equipment is very old, the bathroom equipment is broken, and the service is poor. Because I arrived late, check-in was almost 11 o'clock, family members called to the hotel, and the hotel switchboard was very rude to hang up. Because of frequent business trips, this is basically the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. 
0	"The online introduction to the book ""Dulala's Promotion"" is very good. I have seen many typos in the book. I am disappointed and regretful! I think it should not be a matter of the writing level of the writer! ! ! "
1	"This is the second time I have seen memoirs written by soldiers of the defeated country, and the other is ""Memoirs of the Battle of Nuomen Threshold"" written by the Japanese. I am shocked again! To appreciate the cruelty of war from the perspective of the loser, without the fancy of heroism, to review the cruelty and meaninglessness of war from the perspective of a normal person can smash all the gorgeous coats of war. Both sides of the battlefield are normal people, but they have become beasts on the battlefield! Great book! recommend! Especially for the so-called iron-blooded angry youths! It is much more real than domestic iron-blooded literature. Compared with domestic war works, many of them are YY! "
0	I don't think there is anything good, there are many things that are deliberately fabricated. Such as cucumber carts and corn carts. Where are these stuff? 
1	"After reading ""Food Determines Life and Death"", I think it is an easy-to-understand health science book. From this, I realized that food has such a great impact on health. Many diseases are related to healthy diet. A correct and reasonable diet can keep us away from many diseases. At the same time, it also let me know the role of functional foods that are beneficial to us in health regulation. After the correct medical treatment, with the conditioning of functional foods, we can recover from the disease faster. I am eating spirulina and it feels good. "
0	There are only two USB ports, which is a bit less. The 13-inch version should be lighter and thinner. The operating system vista is not as easy to use as XP. The key is that many important software, such as anti-virus software, are incompatible and very depressed. . . 
1	It's okay, but unfortunately I can't help install the memory stick. And my classmate’s second disk can be backed up by double-clicking, but mine can’t 
0	The first time I booked such a bad room, it may be due to Golden Week. The price and the grade are not the same. The screen windows are broken, the toilet is broken, the air conditioner is filled with water, and there is no salt in the restaurant of the villa. The price is still the same. Shanghai is almost the same. The entire hotel seems to have no one doing sanitation work, summed up in three words: dirty, messy, bad! ! ! Can't stay here next time! Afraid! ! 
1	I just bought it for less than a month, and I found it very tiring to use it two days ago. My eyes accidentally found that the screen jumped very badly (it was very shaking). I thought my eyes were too tired. I hurt my eyes. In fact, when I first came out last year, I bought one and it worked well. So this year, my boyfriend gave me another one as a birthday gift, but it was so bad~~ I need an explanation. . . 
0	It was bad when it was delivered, and it didn't light up. I also blamed me for accepting the goods by swiping my card without trying. So I have to talk about the inspection of the maintenance point by myself, and then replace it, and the machine is still useless. When placing an order, there is an option, whether to let Jingdong test the machine on its behalf, just click it. Jingdong quality inspection department should pay attention 
1	I bought a 6400 CPU for 1.369 yuan, which is almost the same as the original budget. I am very satisfied. 2. The color is good. There is another blue one on the market, which is not as good-looking 
0	This hotel can only be considered a Samsung at best, and it does not reach the five-star standard in terms of hardware or software. I booked three rooms online on September 14 and checked in on the 19th, but I was told that I did not receive the reservation form at the front desk , After contacting Ctrip, I waited for a full half an hour before checking in. During this period, I did not get an apology from the front desk, and also divided several of our rooms into different floors, saying that there is no room on the same floor; but it is not the case Yes, there are a few friends who are traveling with us and are assigned to my floor. It proves that there is no room but the front desk deliberately made things difficult. After the front desk and the front desk, we arranged several rooms together. People are angry and will never stay at this hotel again. In addition, the direct check-in at the front desk is 488, and the price of Ctrip is 588. 
1	The delivery is timely and the packaging is good. The screen has no bright spots, the heat dissipation is good (I was a little worried, and some commented that the ASUS notebook is not good), and the noise is low. The configuration is high, 3Dmark2005 scores 8600, full-featured, cost-effective. All in all, it's not bad, more cost-effective than HP and Lenovo. 
0	I saw this book serialized in the newspaper and strongly recommended it to my friends. After reading it, my friend said that it was not as good as what I had praised, and the plot was also general. I was frustrated and didn't have the interest to read this book. 
0	Book a hotel for a colleague.... The feedback came back that this hotel is really bad, similar to a guest house! Tangshan hotels are not cost-effective at all. 
0	After buying this set of books, the child didn't have much interest, and only read it a few times. Now I am resting in the drawer. Let her read it slowly. I wonder if she is not used to reading this kind of picture book? 
1	I bought it for kids in middle school. After receiving it, I browsed it first and felt that it was written well. It can help the growing and curious middle school students understand their physical and psychological characteristics, and how to make friends and stay away from harmful things. The writing is very good and comprehensive. I grew up in a rural area. When I was young, I never read this kind of book, so I took a lot of detours. It is worth seeing for growing middle school students. Parents can also take a look, which can guide the growth of children in adolescence. 
1	There is one sentence in the book that left a deep impression on me. The more books you read, the stronger your understanding and the smarter you will be. 
0	Pros: There is an elevator (the Kaifeng Hotel on the 4th floor does not even have an elevator), and there seems to be no phone harassment at night (Kaifeng Hotel harassed and finally chatted with the massage lady on the phone) Disadvantages; the room is like a guest house, the equipment is aging, can it be counted as 3 stars? The price is high, the price is not good! The door is noisy and it feels bad! 
1	"Let me borrow the words of Old Xu on the cover of this book: ""Reading a book by a smart woman is a kind of enjoyment, knowing, not tired...? After reading the first book, I want to buy the second book, although it is a book The novel embodies the warmth and coldness of the workplace. I have read a lot of books about the workplace, but only these two are very impressive. I feel very enjoyable after reading it. From interpersonal relationships to professional knowledge, all the evils are supplemented, the most important thing The thing is, it can give people outside the city a glimpse of the stories inside the high walls, and they are always ready to be among them... "
1	There were too many harassment calls between 10pm and 4am, and I often couldn't fall asleep. I reported it to the reception, but it didn't work! 
0	"My daughter, who is almost 4 years old, likes it very much! I also bought ""100 Princess Stories for Girls"". Because my daughter recently liked Disney princesses, I bought it. I also bought the full set of Carmela plus this Seven volumes, she didn't expect her daughter to listen to the princess story only, and this Carmela's, she had to take it over and read it by herself, and she giggled. . . . . . After reading it several times, I found that this is her favorite book among the books I bought in the past few years.. "
1	Tell the interpersonal relationship in the workplace through a few stories and the rationale of doing things. It feels real, and some stories seem to be happening around me. It is worth reading for both those who are about to enter the workplace or those who are struggling in the workplace. I am like Cindy in the story. There are many trivial things, but it is difficult to get high scores during the year-end assessment. The boss will not look at how many tickets you have booked. All he sees is how much money you make. But can you say that booking tickets is not a job? A book worthy of meticulous recollection, read only once and never talk. 
1	Overall it is quite satisfactory. The room layout is rather unique, with LCD TV and digital TV, and the bathroom is relatively clean. The network speed is relatively fast. 
1	The hotel is in my favorite horse racing area. It is backed by the mountain and it is very comfortable. You can also go to the nearby hundreds of international supermarkets within a two-minute walk, where you can buy fresh food from all over the world. ^_^, far away, The hotel room is a bit smaller, as everyone knows, Hong Kong is too expensive. There is no way to have a smaller room. Fortunately, the surroundings of the hotel are elegant and quiet, the hotel lobby is very nostalgic English style, and there are free buses to the subway. Zhongzhan, the price is also competitive, and overall it is quite satisfactory. 
0	"The receptionist came from me and never laughed, it was cool! The slow broadband reminds me of the era of ""cats""! The sound of the central air-conditioning is booming and lively! The receptionist arranges the bus to the airport in the morning of the second day. I fully promised that no one would confirm with me when I checked out. I looked at the cool Chengdu MM and did not ask. "
1	The hotel is in a good environment, especially when all the fountains are activated together at 5:30 in the afternoon. It is really spectacular! Come out for a walk at night and feel the tranquility and freshness. The neat rows of small lights seem to take you into a dreamy world. It is a good choice for couples to choose this hotel. Unfortunately, I did not see the peach blossoms, saying that the flowering period is over. The breakfast is too simple and does not meet the hotel's standards. When checking out, upstairs told the front desk that I was leaking in the room A facial cleanser was delivered to me personally, and a cosmetic bag was included, which is worthy of praise! There are scenery everywhere in Taoyuan in the south, and the Fontaine Egret is worth living. I will choose a villa next time. 
0	The hardware is at most 3 and a half stars, the lobby is dark, and the rooms are small and featureless. The service of the housekeeping department is quite good and responsive. 
0	"I stayed at this hotel in early May. I can only describe ""bad"" in 2 words. It is the worst 5-star I have ever seen. In the evening, the disco ballroom on the first floor will be open until 2:30 in the morning, the sound is noisy, and There are accent drums that make the guests on the 18th floor unable to sleep. It is unimaginable how the guests on the lower floors can endure such a 5-star treatment! The breakfast is simple, this is also the first time I have reviewed a hotel that I have stayed in. Too bad! If there is an option for 0 points, I will choose 0 points without hesitation "
0	The hotel’s facilities and services are up to 2.5 stars and the hardware does not match the description. The sanitary condition is average, there are stains on the sheets that cannot be washed off, there are sand particles on the bed (?????!!!), the door is not soundproof... Breakfast only has rice and pickles, and there is only a small bowl per person, because if you add it, the guests who come later can't even eat rice. Although it is during the Spring Festival, this kind of service is incredible. I used to book rooms all over the country through Ctrip, and found out that the star rating was exaggerated, but it was not outrageous. The description of Ctrip's online hotel is so different from the actual quality of the hotel that I have encountered it for the first time. The hardware and services of Yalan and Rongsheng Villas in Deqing are of several grades. According to the Ctrip operating procedures I understand, the description and photos of the online hotel are uploaded by the hotel itself. I suggest that Ctrip do some spot checks and reviews appropriately. A situation like Luqiu Holiday will greatly affect users' trust in Ctrip, although the information is provided by the hotel. 
0	There is no pre-installed window system, and the heat dissipation is average. Just after buying it, I found that it is now sending genuine anti-virus software 
1	It should be my first contact with spiritual books, and I am very fortunate to find such a popular spiritual book. Explaining each point of view through the form of novels, the explanation does have the flavor of fables, but the more I look at the back, the more I feel that it seems to contradict the previous view that material determines consciousness. According to the author, consciousness determines material Concept. But all of them are very reasonable, and I have learned a lot of ways to repel my own pessimism. Maybe I haven't reached the advanced level yet, and I will read it later. The paper of the book is very good, I like it very much 
0	1. The display must be delivered to know whether it is LED or LCD 2. Graphics card second point 3. The keyboard feels bad quality and may have problems in the future4. There are too few disk partitions, there should be at least three, and the c drive system area should be smaller 
0	The pre-installed Vista of this machine is not compatible with Rising Antivirus, blue screen, can not enter the system, can not uninstall by itself! ! Be careful not to pretend, you can use kaba. 
0	I turned it on after I came back. I felt like there was no system but I couldn’t get in. Anyway, I still can’t operate. I need first aid. 
1	Every time I book a hotel, I read reviews on the Internet and found that this hotel has a good review and the price is reasonable. In addition to booking a room by myself, I also booked a room for clients. After I arrived, it was really good. The hotel took into account my contact with customers and upgraded my room. It’s the first time I encountered an upgrade, so happy. The rooms are spacious, clean, and the waiters are friendly and deliver fruits. Because of geographic reasons, the scenery outside the window is not very good. But he was relatively close to Vientiane City, and he was very happy to take a stroll with the customer. If you go to Shenzhen again, if you don't go to Hong Kong, you still live here. Because I was busy, it took 20 days to comment. If you go to Hong Kong, choose Rujia Fishing Village Store. There are restaurants, fruit shops and pharmacies downstairs, which is very convenient. It's just a bit hard to find. 
1	A good book! It can answer some daily questions, and it can also help change some wrong skin care concepts. The fly in the ointment is that some things are too general, and you have to think about it yourself. Personally, I think it’s still suitable for MMs who have a good foundation in beauty. For example (forgot to be the one in Daren 2 or 3), it talks about a transparent essence with multiple beauty ingredients, just the sentence can have Q10 What about the ingredients? If the reader does not know that Q10 ingredients will show a strong lemon yellow, then they will not understand this rhetorical question. . . 
1	The paint personally feels better than HP's, the heat is well controlled, and it feels better than the HP's heat dissipation I used before. The speakers are loud enough and the screen effect is good, although not as good as SONY. The 256M graphics card is still enough for running games. 
0	Such decoration and facilities are actually a five-star hotel, down! House prices are really outrageous, and any company agreement is only in the early 300s. The location is good in Baotou. It is convenient to eat around. There is a glass hot pot which is delicious and cheap (but the beef and mutton in Baotou are good, and the hot pot may be good). At night, there was a lady who followed to the room. How could it be a mess! 
0	"1 The battery is not as good as expected. The full display is more than 7 hours, which is a bit depressing. 2 It is really easy to leave fingerprints. 3 Besides the fan, there is a ""squeaking"" sound. I don't know if it is a computer problem. . Don't understand. . . 4I suggest you bring your own mouse at any time~~ Finished, thank you "
1	The room should exceed 30 square meters, which is one of the few hotels of the same level in HK; after reinstallation, the equipment is also good. 
1	After waiting for nine days, my beloved book finally arrived. It took two days from remittance to delivery, and seven days from delivery to delivery. When I got the book, I felt very funny: in the seven-day shipping process, The outer package of the book has been devastated very poorly, but the package of Dangdang is still quite strong, and the book inside is safe and sound. The content of the book is quite practical. It is suitable for front-line teachers, or for people like me who have mastered a little flash foundation. Study hard, the days of improving every day will accompany me again! 
0	The hotel facilities are aging, and the services are mutually recommended. How can you enjoy the 4-star service without 4-star facilities? Even the 4-star air-conditioning cannot be used. Dining is the standard of public canteens, and the price is ````````` 
0	Generally speaking, it is not very good. It is also very reluctant to need the doorman to help with the luggage on the day of entry. The waiter took a shower earlier than you and watched TV in the room opposite you. The hygiene cleaning after staying for a few days is also very sloppy. The next day I think the bathroom is very smelly and ask them to clean it again under your nose. This hotel is the original guest house remodeled and expanded, so many hotels basically do not have the implementation, which is not worth the price! 
0	This is my nightmare trip! What attraction? It's a place that hasn't been developed yet, and there are loess and excavators everywhere! The hardware facilities of the hotel are also terribly poor! Four stars, I think two stars Almost half of the things contained in the product were not honored! It was said that it included two buffet breakfasts, but the hotel said that they are in the off-season and there is no breakfast buffet at all, so they gave two noodles casually. There are also entertainment facilities! The so-called so-called The wellness center is an empty house (almost no decoration), with a pool table, a ping pong table, and a few target papers crookedly posted on the wall! In addition to these three things, there are also There is a cabinet, the rest is without any decoration, and there are white walls on all sides! Moreover, there is no service staff inside! There is also fishing, which is completely a muddy pond! There are weeds on the side! There is no fish! It is not usable at all! It's the excavator working! Not to mention the bicycle! The yellow sand outside! No attraction! Where to go to play?? It's a waste of money and time!! If the customer service staff don't believe me, I took a lot of real scenes locally The photos (which were originally intended to be used for complaints) can be sent to you for a reward! Additional comment April 11, 2008: Also, the barbecue place is in a mess, horribly dirty, and not open at all! Halo! 
1	"The room is newly renovated this year and it is very nice. The service is good, there is a pick-up service, and the pick-up and drop-off staff are very friendly and feel good to the guests. I proposed to change the water bill at checkout, and every time I said that the system did not support it, but every time I changed it in the end. I am not satisfied with this point. I hope the waiter will think about it before saying ""NO"" and try to solve the problem for the guests. I don’t know if the ticket booking service is under the management of the hotel. I feel that there is a certain gap between the service and the overall level of the hotel. Hotel feedback July 15, 2008: Thank you for choosing our hotel and your valuable comments for us. We have made rectifications for your comments. I hope you can choose our hotel next time in Kunming. We will Sincerely at your service! "
0	The hotel is under renovation and smells great. When I left the hotel, I remember clearly that I missed a string of Tibetan Dzi beads in the room. It took three hours to remember it. Then I called the hotel reception, but the waiter who cleaned up the room just said that I didn’t see it. Could it be Buddha? Appear, let the prayer beads fly by themselves? It is estimated that the waiter took it by himself, and I am embarrassed to hand it over. It is really a problem with the character of the waiter! That is a string of very commemorative prayer beads, what a pity! Hotel feedback August 8, 2008: I am very sorry that this happened, and we are very surprised about the problem you have reported. The hotel management made a corresponding investigation in time, but according to the current situation, it cannot be confirmed that the attendant on duty took your prayer beads. But no matter what the result is, the hotel will take measures to strengthen the professional ethics of employees, and try to prevent such things from happening again! The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, which are decorated according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
0	1) Without a bag, I had to pack it in my big book bag when I went out; 2) The button elasticity is a bit small, and it is easy to press the wrong key when typing; 3) The vertical resolution of the screen is low, for some dialog boxes that are not adjustable Cannot be displayed completely. 
1	Behind the cold text is a lonely heart. Most of the protagonists in Baby Annie's works are bohemian and rebellious, withdrawn from the society, but they are not eliminated by society. Sober note: The text is profound. After reading such text, you will feel that a needle is slowly piercing your skin and reaching your heart. Pain and sober. Some texts can only be incomprehensible if you read it coarsely; you can only resonate with careful reading. However, the dark text is easy to fall into. Unknowingly, he sinks into the cold and desolate world created by Baby Anne for us. Teach people to block their hearts and become silent. 
1	I stayed in the hotel when it was just renovated. After a year, it looks a bit old and may not be well maintained. The attitude of the service staff is very good, but the hardware is a bit close. It's not cheap in places like Zhengzhou. Breakfast is not rich enough. 
1	I thought that books about Chinese medicine would be as obscure as ancient classical Chinese. After reading Teacher Wu’s book, I found that the knowledge of Chinese medicine can also be written like prose, beautiful yet professional, short and short. It is a good book worthy of reading because of its profound principles, popularization and great wisdom. I personally feel that it is inadequate. After reading through it, I feel that the content is a little bit small. If I can systematically introduce the curative effect of relevant acupoints, I believe it will be better. More health-preserving friends benefit, not just remembering a few key points. 
1	The location of the hotel is very good, the decoration is a bit old, the service is okay, warm and attentive, I will stay there if I have the opportunity. 
1	I live in the newly renovated East Building. I feel that the room is quite spacious and the facilities are good, not bad compared to the Shangri-La store next door. It's just that other aspects of the hotel, such as the lobby, the environment of the western restaurant, and the food varieties need to be improved. Otherwise the price difference is not too far, I might as well live in Shangri-La. 
0	I don’t know if the sentence in the book is a translation problem or a problem expressed by the author, which makes people feel a bit awkward, and some of the points raised by the author cannot be agreed. 
1	The quality didn’t say, it’s aimed at Xiaohei~Perfect screen~~HOHO~~ But after installing XP, the power drive and keyboard sound control keys don’t work, it’s still under study~ 
1	I have been looking for a set of popular science books suitable for children, and finally I set my sights on this set. I got the book yesterday and my son can't wait to read it. I went through all of them. Generally speaking, the content and illustrations are good. If this set of books can add more art, such as calligraphy, pictures, music, etc., I think it will be more ideal and complete. In addition, thanks to the service of Dangdang.com, the books arrived very quickly, and the books on the Internet are generally relatively complete. I hope that Dangdang will become more and more prosperous and continue to maintain high-quality services. 
1	The location of the hotel is very convenient, the small suite rooms are more spacious and comfortable, and the hotel charges 40 yuan for parking overnight. 
1	The basic facilities are OK and the service is warm. Breakfast is average, but has Jiangxi characteristics. The problem I feel is the sound insulation of the walls and doors, which is not very good. 
1	The workmanship is very fine, the appearance is very beautiful, SONY deserves to be a brand. As for the configuration, of course, it is not as expensive as the general machine. I went for the brand. This configuration is satisfactory for me. 
1	Very good 5 star hotel. The room is also very clean, but the TV is too small, and it is far from the bed, it is not clear. The attitude of the service staff is also very good. Will definitely live again next time. 
1	It costs 15 yuan to take a taxi from the city, which is a bit remote, but later I found that the environment is good and I am satisfied 
0	1. I charged 10 yuan for the subscription fee, but I can't make a call; 2. The toothbrush box is an empty box 3. No shopping bag is provided 
1	YTO is very fast. I got on the car in Guangzhou at night on the 25th to scan, and arrived in Fuding City on the morning on the 27th; the display is delicate, the keyboard feels good, square, and the appearance is clear 
1	1) Metal shell, with strong technology and business atmosphere; 2) The size of the keyboard is similar to that of a normal notebook, and the fingers can be completely released without worrying about the small keyboard; 3) The running speed is fast, I have installed Vista and Windows7 RC, both It runs smoothly. I use Win7 RC for almost two months now. I have no problem surfing the Internet or watching movies. 4) It is lighter and lighter than ordinary notebooks. I took it on a business trip with my colleagues some time ago. Comparing with a large notebook, it feels light. My colleagues said that I would also buy a small notebook for business trips! 
1	It is the more comfortable hotel I have stayed in near Beidaihe, managed by Gloria, and the services and facilities are more formal. The room is a bit old, but still tidy, the water is a bit yellow, it is recommended to bring more bottled water to drink, the environment is good. The service is also good and efficient. What I am more satisfied with is the restaurant. The food tastes good, and it is not very expensive. It also prepares plastic tableware for the little ones, which is very thoughtful. 
0	When I bought it, I saw it clearly. It was in Mandarin, but when I received it, it was in Cantonese and the color was not good. It was very dark. 
1	Generally speaking, it is good, except that the bed is smaller and bigger, the others are good, newly renovated, and the service is good! 
1	"My son first read ""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" and ""Journey to the West"", and then begged me to buy him a full set, which happened to be the first day of the month. He gave it to him as a gift, and he loved it. The pinyin version is suitable for lower grade primary school students to read, and can help children understand classical literature. With books he likes, my son doesn't watch TV too much, and he keeps asking me about what stories the characters tell in the book, and so on. I also bought a lot of books, read with my son every night, and enjoy the joy of reading Dangdang brings. It's really good... It's good value for money. "
1	"If people in this world can understand each other, there would be no such thing as discrimination in this world. Every kind of person is not terrible. Type B people are just more agile in their minds, able to walk far ahead without being fettered by foreign objects. Of course, they don't want to be dragged down by too much burden, they are willing to go ahead alone. But in essence they are harmless to other humans in this world. Because everyone's fundamental focus is different, there is no problem of ""resources being seized"". So there is no need to kill people of this blood type like the Nazis treated Jews. "
1	Small, powerful, workmanship is superior in similar products (the price is also the same), rich configuration, Bluetooth, camera, card reader, 3 UBS ports, keyboard quality 
0	This book became popular in the craze of Chinese studies. The true culture belongs to all mankind, and the practice of advocating Chinese learning is itself counter-cultural. The affairs that appear in this context must be a freak. 
1	I think only Hong Chen who combines the background and culture of the East and the West can write such a wonderful Feng Shui novel. The plot of the second book made me feel a lot of surprises and surprises, and finally I was moved to tears by some love emotions. The analysis of Feng Shui from all over the world is integrated into the dialogue, and it seems to be relish. The dialogue about Feng Shui on Wall Street is especially wonderful. The real geographical environment and the almost sci-fi plot make me feel that the real and the virtual are intertwined. This novel is not only the best entry for laymen to understand Feng Shui, but also a wonderful and magical journey. 
0	Fingerprints are easy to stick, heat around the touchpad, the memory stick is DDR2, the graphics card is 3400, which is not in line with the standard of Jingdong 
0	"Very bad hotel, not like a three-star hotel at all. 1. Lobby: The reception is very slow, and the waiter can't even say hello; 2. Room: I booked a room with a double bed, the TV is very old, the bathroom in the bathroom is partitioned by glass, and the space is very small , And the hot water is full of brown-red rust inside. The temperature of the water is hot and cold during the bath. What is more abnormal is that there is no network cable in the room, you have to call for it, and the power socket is very unreasonable. For the laptop power supply, you need to move the TV cabinet forward at least 50 cm, otherwise you can’t find the jack; 3. Order food: According to the ""Service Guide"", I dialed 8003, indicating that there is no such number, so I dialed 8006 to inquire and inform. I called 8033. After the call, I was asked to call 8031. Is it so troublesome to order a meal? I finally got through. I ordered braised grass carp, stir-fried potato shreds and seaweed soup, but it turned out to be terribly unpalatable. It was not as delicious as a small restaurant outside. Instead, it cost more than 70 yuan, which is not made by a three-star hotel chef. , Makes people angry! The color of seaweed soup is like boiling water! Seaweed is also a blockbuster! 3. Service: I called for a network cable. After a long time, is the Oasis Hotel big? Take that long? ! I have stayed at Oasis Hotel several times, this time it was the worst! ! ! I recommend Lida Hotel to everyone, the price is very good, the service is also very good, and the dishes cooked are very homely and taste very delicious! Although it's a little farther, it only costs 7 yuan to take a taxi to the city center. The only downside is that there is no broadband connection. Additional comments August 16, 2007: Another point is the most unbearable: the sound insulation is too bad! There was a drunk man living next to my room. The groaning and snoring sounds were as if they were in the same room, and the sound of watching TV and talking were very clear! "
1	Overall it's not bad, it's a better class hotel in Zhangzhou area. The location is also good, with seafood stalls opposite. A shortcoming: the breakfast service is not good, only two of the six waiters are working, and the rest are chatting with a loud voice. Hope to improve! 
1	When I first saw the introduction on the website, although I saw it has various reputations, I felt that the pictures were messy and I was not interested. Later, a friend bought it and said yes, then let's buy a set. When he reached his 4-year-old son, he was very happy. He had to bring me to tell him about it when I went out to eat early. He said that this was his favorite book, which caused me to talk about 42 pages in one breath and strongly demanded a rest. While I was talking, I attracted many children to watch, which made him even more proud. It seems that you cannot decide whether to buy or not according to your own preferences. Books that have been well received are still worth buying. 
1	I stayed for one night when I returned to Heilongjiang in early October. All my evaluations are based on the local situation in Qiqihar. I don't think I can compare it with similar hotels in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. The surrounding environment is pretty good, there are basically taxis waiting downstairs at any time, and there are shopping malls and supermarkets nearby. The service is very good, active and enthusiastic, the umbrella forgot the service desk, very active to remind me. No harassing calls. It is a little noisy, and the phone calls from the service desk in the corridor can be heard occasionally. Without a computer, I don't know the network situation. Because of the train time problem, I originally planned to delay check-out by one hour, but the service desk proactively extended it by 2 hours. The central air-conditioning is also good, I don't know what will happen in winter, the shower hot water is very good. 
1	Of course it is a great value. When I went to Pacific to buy the keyboard membrane, mm said that many people bought the 540 series membrane. It can be seen that many people buy this one and follow the masses. 
1	The environment is very good, the location is very convenient, the service is also very good, I will live next time! 
1	Absolutely genuine books, as long as you understand and thoroughly understand the contents of the three major books, and assist with some real questions, I believe that the exam will achieve excellent results~ It seems that the exam is not an IQ test, but an EQ test~ Very long The key to time preparation is persistence! It is hoped that all the comrades on the road of Si Kao will achieve victory in 2009. The best learning repetition is repetition, and the exam is just as useful. Read the book steadily. If you want to become a master, you have to live a life that is not human. The life of studying is hard. You have to be lonely, abandon all temptations, and read this book with confidence! 
1	The most cost-effective in sony notebook, I added a 2g Kingston DDRII800 note, compatibility is no problem, but when I opened the additional memory, I found that the original memory of the machine is Hynix 
1	I played in the Ocean Park for a day, and brought my tired body to the hotel in Admiralty. I thought it would be expensive, but it is not very expensive, because I called the lady at the front desk before I came. How did Admiralty get to the hotel. The front desk told me that I could get there by 5B, but after I got off the bus at Admiralty, I didn’t know where to find a station where I could take 5B, so if I was cruel, I called it, which is 27 yuan and I can get to the hotel. . Arriving at the hotel, the lady at the front desk spoke mildly, and the speed was quite fast. When all the procedures were completed, she told me softly: Has helped you upgrade to an executive room. At that moment there was ecstasy in my heart. When I got to the room, the inside was not bad. Although it was not very big, it was not as small as I imagined (because I have been to Hong Kong a few times before, and we have lived in the small one). Outside the window is a residential building and you can see the sea. The toilets are also quite clean. Put your luggage and go downstairs to find food. There are several small shops nearby that are not closed. A bowl of wonton noodles at ten yuan is a low cost in Hong Kong. The taste is okay. When I went down to look at it during the day, it turned out that the street was a vegetable market. As a housewife, I also compared the prices. It turns out that our prices are really too high. Some things are actually the same price as ours. However, their income is N times ours. Don't say it. Overall, this hotel is okay in every way. If I have a chance to go to Hong Kong, I will choose this hotel. But I just think the price of the hotel is a little bit higher (HK715). Maybe it’s the reason for summer vacation. And the daily price is different, a bit like seafood price. 
0	The driver is more difficult to install. After downloading the sound card from the GATEWAY website, the MODEM driver still cannot be used. Finally, you need to use the driver wizard to help install it. The problem has been solved by itself. . 
1	I was planning to watch it again in a few months. It was really too tempting. I spent one night watching the finale. Watching this episode gave me a new understanding of many people and events in the last years of the Ming Dynasty. , I also have an understanding of the person who is ultimately responsible for the demise of the Ming Dynasty. To put it bluntly, Chongzhen is an emperor who was born untimely. If the Ming Dynasty could last a hundred years earlier, Huang Taiji’s grandson would not be able to fight Enter Shanhaiguan. But history is history, and sometimes it is fate, and the things of the Ming Dynasty seem to be nothing more than that. 
0	Although there is a big difference in the content of the book, the cover feels very unprofessional. ? ? Extremely depressed! 
1	The content of the book is pretty good! I started to contact Harry Potter when I was in junior high school. At that time, I hesitated to buy it for economic reasons. I wanted to buy the first printed version when I was able to buy it 7 years later. After searching for Dangdang for a long time, according to the version information provided by Dangdang, I thought that I finally found the first printed version. I didn’t expect that it was not the first printed version at all (some even reprinted 26 times). I was very sad. There is a feeling of being deceived. Please be more meticulous about Dangdang's services in the future. If you want to write the version information, please write it all, otherwise, don't write it and don't mislead consumers. Thank you!

To gain a more comprehensive understanding and make more accurate judgments, the only way to look at the real objects and make more comparisons. It is difficult to learn how to identify with just a few color pictures. The 421 and 422 color pages are not cut. When cutting, be careful not to cut it easily in the center, otherwise the folded color pictures will be damaged.

1	The room is a bit old. And the room I stayed in was not cleaned after I went in. The front desk and the waiter did not cooperate well. Additional comment December 9, 2007: The service of this hotel is not as good as before, and the facilities are also old. Up. 
0	A lousy hotel with similar two stars! I don't know how to get the 3 stars? First of all, the room is very dark and the walls are very dirty! There are signs of water seepage on the wall, and the bathroom is very, very small! ! ! There is no bathtub and so on with a shower curtain between them. The towels are very worn out, and I think they are too dirty! ! ! The room's color light is severely lacking, and the service attitude is not good. I keep saying that my room is full, but I haven't watched the computer for personal registration! Let the change of houses push three blocks and four blocks! This is Samsung's standard. .

1	"Zhongshan Hotel has a very good location, located in the city center, convenient for transportation, shopping and eating. The room is very clean, but the area is slightly smaller, especially the bathroom is slightly cramped. Recommend the buffet Russian dinner at the 38-story revolving restaurant, 99 yuan per person, with more varieties, good taste and high cost performance. We recommend the lamb chops grilled on site. From 18 o'clock on the hour, there will be a Russian and male duo chorus performance. The only dissatisfaction is that the double standard room only provides a breakfast coupon, which is not enough. There are 2 options for the free breakfast coupon provided by the hotel. It is recommended not to go to a tea restaurant on the 5th floor. The breakfast voucher is only worth 30 yuan, which is not enough. The excess part will not only have to be paid, but also 15% of the price adjustment tax. The taste is also average. It is recommended to go to the revolving restaurant on the 38th floor for breakfast (with breakfast voucher for free, 49 yuan per person), the variety and taste are far better than the 5-star Teda Grand Mercure buffet breakfast. The hotel’s distinctive feature is the Indian doorman, and the few mynahs in the lobby who only say ""hello"" and ""thank you"" are more attractive to children. "
0	The pre-installed partition is unreasonable and there are defects in the JD delivery link. The EMS I selected was sent to E-mail without communicating with me in advance, and the customer service response was slow. During the free shipping period, the charge for sending me E-mail was unfair. , If you decide on your own without communicating, it's even more obvious that you are not doing business, but being an official! 
0	I placed an order for this book on October 3, and I have not received the book until now. I have complained several times. At the beginning, the customer service returned me a letter. Then there was no news. I feel that the competition is fierce. In the era, if you do customer service in this way, you will definitely be eliminated. When I have lost my confidence and complain again, I received an email from Dangdang today, let me comment, not seeing it and not worrying, since I have been invited , I have to say a few words. 
1	Close to the Victoria Harbour, the scenery is great. There are elderly fishing people and tourists walking in the surrounding area. It is very comfortable. The hotel's service is good and quiet, but shopping is not convenient. Fortunately, there is a 30-minute shuttle bus to Mody Road and Peking Road in Tsim Sha Tsui. The newly developed Huangpu Xintiandi next to it is not very good, and the food court and shopping mall are not very good. Next time I go shopping, I will definitely not stay in this hotel, although the service is very good. 
1	Things are not bad, the led screen is very bright, the workmanship is relatively fine, the drawing is good, the price of 4399 is back and it is worth it. When I came back, I changed the XP system. The genuine vista was put aside and was no longer used. The system installation process was relatively smooth. lenovo's website has drivers 
0	I originally bought a set and intended to give it to my parents, hoping that they are in good health, but I saw some first, and the overall feeling is exaggerated and hollow. The thinking of the whole book is also very confusing, it seems that I can write whatever I think of, so that there are many similar contents in the three sets of books. Many acupuncture points did not specify how to find them. I personally feel that the cases in the book are not convincing. I read so many good reviews that I bought a set without even thinking about it, but to me I was very disappointed and didn't dare to send it out. I was skeptical about the content of this book. 
1	"The storyline of this book is not very strong. The characters are simple, and there are no twists and turns. In Yishu’s new classics, there are very few stories like ""Xibao"" and ""My First Half Life"", which are full of twists and turns. However, in the process of hosting the mailbox, the protagonist's thoughts and attitudes towards dealing with problems are also very interesting. No need to learn, no need to learn, because some are extreme. As one of the piles of Yi Shu's novels on the bookshelf, this one was indeed bought for the sake of buying. It is neither like nor dislike. When I feel up next time, I don't know when it is. "
0	The wireless Internet keeps dropping, I don’t know why, it’s not as good as my old HP! xp partition reinstallation is too much trouble! 
0	I haven't read Naoko Takagi's book before. I always heard that it was good. I finally bought one this time. Maybe she's not used to her style, she doesn't like it very much, the content is a bit tedious and lacks the feeling of having a smile after reading it. A bit disappointed. 
0	I am really very upset. I originally liked to live here in Cixi. Because I didn't bring my books when I came this time, I stayed in an executive double room. The 6th floor is really bad! ! ! ! ! The room temperature is 29 degrees at night, and the air conditioner won't turn on! ! ! With the windows open, facing the outside is a car freight station! I told the front desk to change the room, but I said directly that the other side is the road! ! It's all very noisy! ! My wife is really disappointed.... Change, resolutely change, I won't be able to stop next time. Additional comments May 16, 2007: There is really no way. I stayed in 2 rooms for 2 days. I really want to give a score of 1 for 4 consecutive reviews. I'm so angry! ! Breaking the network is also a mess. 
1	Very good book, after experiencing all kinds of pressures in modern society, read this book, it is endless 
1	The service is generally very good, and the service can be easily obtained through the room phone, and the price is competitive. There is a regret: the hotel is not very convenient to take a taxi; at the same time, the hotel canceled the airport BUS, which is somewhat inconvenient for guests. 
0	There is no need to pre-install Linux, after all, most users are still used to Windows, which is more convenient in the Dos environment... 
1	For this price point, the functional configuration is quite in place. The appearance of the machine is also satisfactory, and the installation of the system is also very convenient.

1	It is sold at special price and is very affordable. The current price of 4488 is without a bag. The exterior design is high-grade. The interior and exterior are all black piano lacquer with metal dark lines. It is much more beautiful than the picture. It is exquisite and elegant. Friends like it. The performance is not bad 6400.2G.250G.9300 alone, and the LED screen, the effect is super good 
0	There are too few expansion ports, the USB ports are all on the left, the design is not very user-friendly, and it does not match the heat sink provided (the USB ports of the heat sink are on the right), and the thickness is a bit thick. 
1	The performance of Thinkpad has nothing to say, everyone on earth knows it, even if it comes to Thinkpad, ha ha. The classmate gave a 50 yuan east coupon, which is a good deal 
0	Because I didn’t have time to check it online, I had to make a phone call, but Ctrip tried desperately to recommend it to me. Result: The standard double bed room is very small, only 12 square meters. The 530 window I live in is a platform with very bad security; the towels are very old, black and hard, the worst I have ever seen; breakfast is good, variety There are a few more; the lobby is ok, and the service at the reception has 4 stars. Feedback from the hotel May 5, 2008: 
1	I also read lie to me and knew Paul Ekman, the author of this book. I saw the protagonist of the TV so strong, and I was stunned, and I was curious about the inadvertent omission of people’s micro-expressions. I bought this book. Although I have only read about 30 pages, I found that it is not as boring as the previous buddies commented. The whole book is full of logical rigor, but it is vivid and interesting to read. A lot of examples in life are used to illustrate different situations. The different analysis of this is a rigorous and advanced textbook for catching panic. It would be great if one day I could study with Paul Ekman! This is my future wish! 
1	Because the company is about to implement competency, I bought four books on competency in Dangdang. I read all four books. I think this is the most suitable for beginners. The regulations are very clear and the content can be practical immediately Many examples are written in the context of sales companies. It just so happens that our company is also a sales company, so it feels very practical. The content is relatively shallow, but it is easy to understand because the logical relationship is also very clear. Also, the font is large and it doesn't look too much effort. fair price. Overall it is quite satisfactory. 
0	Personally think that it does not meet the 4-star conditions, the room is very humid, the enzyme smell is too strong, there is no way to sleep, the bathroom conditions are not very good, in short, it feels more like a shortcut hotel 
0	1. Take it back, the partition is not good, the space of C drive is 60%, the space of D drive is 40%, I did one afternoon today, and I used partition magic 8.0, but I couldn’t divide it. Later I still used the recovery disk to hit the original shape. The USB on the side is hard to plug 
0	The CPU is average~ and the motherboard front-side bus only has 667~800 memory and the memory is all reduced to 667. And the graphics card memory is average~ The function keys are not very good~ The driver may not be installed~ The delivery staff's service attitude is average when picking up the goods~ 
0	Trouble repairing. It took 2 weeks to apply for a replacement after I sent it to me for the first time. 
1	"I am now reading the Four Books and Five Classics. After I bought ""The Analects"" and ""Mencius"", I wanted to buy ""The Daxue"" and ""The Doctrine of the Mean"". Later I learned that ""The Daxue"" and ""The Doctrine of the Mean"" are one of the ""Three Rites"", ""The Book of Rites"" Two of them, so I know I am ignorant. Traditional characters, vertical layout, good paper. But there are also regrets. Even after a change, the cover of the second volume is still a bit damaged. I hope that Dangdang will strengthen the quality management of the circulation link in the future. After all, readers usually cherish books, especially the books of Zhonghua Bookstore, which are of high quality and have a certain collection. Value, a little flaw is very bad. "
1	Generally speaking, it's okay, mainly because it's just right to do things, which is convenient. Basically, I will stay here in the future 
0	"Backdoor Tianjin Paradise Hotel is now a ""4"" star hotel. The environment is too chaotic. It is with performing arts venues, like entertainment venues, not like hotels. People in pajamas are walking around, especially breakfast, even 2 stars. The hotels here are not as good; I really don’t know what special treatment the officials who comment on star hotels have enjoyed in the bathing center here. . . . "
0	I wanted to read some psychological books or stories, so I bought this book, but the plot in it was bizarre, and I felt that I was even more abnormal. The ending is even more neurotic~~The teacher actually needs to sleep with her teacher in order to be treated~~How can there be such a thing, I look sick~~In the end, I feel that I wasted my time and I was disappointed. 
0	The book has no content, and the title has all been summarized. I really admire the author's ability to write one thing into a book, and then I read the book about only one thing. I really admire myself as well. 
1	The limited edition is of extraordinary significance, and the price is not too expensive. Although it is several hundred yuan more expensive than the model with the same configuration, it is still worthwhile for me as an NBA fan. The configuration of this computer shines now. It has changed the impression of poor performance from the previous limited edition machines. The powerful performance of this machine has left a deep impression on both the graphics card and the CPU. It is more than enough to handle all the games on the market. It's not a problem to deal with video and audio. 
0	"Agree that ""the book has no substance"" contains a summary of the translations that have problems with food/sign words, etc. The translation errors in most of the simple words are wrong, so there are other meanings, but in fact the probability of this kind of error appears It is very small or very boring. For example, on page 130, when asked about the age of a student, the student said ""I'm fourteen"" as ""I'm forty"". Page 1 says that pear is written as rear. Is this kind of thing also used by the author to make sense? There are many jokes in Chinese and English translations. I believe anyone can find some if they are willing to collect them. Picking up something casually will not only hurt the reader's appetite, but also hurt your own reputation. I am not opposed to entertaining books, but boring entertaining books really turn my appetite. Rubbish! "
1	The price is affordable, the configuration is OK, and the VISTA SP2 scores 3.2! The heat dissipation is better than expected! Always 45-49! No games 
0	"1. The car arrived at the entrance of the hotel and could not find the hotel. It turned out that the building site with scaffolding around was the hotel. I walked in with fear. The front desk was very shabby. It was hard to imagine a four-star hotel. 2. I live in an apartment suite. It looks like the 19th floor. Several elevators can only be reached in one step. It is only possible to change the elevator next door. The walkway upstairs is dim, and there are long corridors. There are only one or two lights. It takes a while to see when you get out of the elevator. It's too cost effective to clean things. 3. Checking in in the morning, the sound of electric drills is constant, the room downstairs was originally being renovated, and Ctrip did not inform in advance, I am dizzy! ! ! 4. The living room is large, but there is space. There is only a sofa but no TV. It turns out that people were asked to sit there in a daze. 5. There is no hot water in the bath. When I asked, it turned out that it was not a unified hot water, but an electric shower. It took a long time to burn a bucket. There was no hot water from one night to the next morning. The waiter said that he didn’t know why. Four-star treatment without hot water. Of course, I didn’t wash in the bath. When I checked out, my mind and body were itchy... 6. When I was thirsty, I boiled water and the electric kettle was broken. Call me to change one. It's off work, it's past eight o'clock in the evening, right? Where can't you change one? Other unoccupied rooms, your manager's office... can always be solved, you can't boil a pot of water, but they ignore you, I can only go to the street to buy water and drink! ! 7. All the furniture and equipment are outdated. I think everyone will understand my feelings. I usually check the internet reviews of my brothers first when I stay in the store. This trip was in a hurry and was booked by phone on the road. The hotel was repeatedly recommended to me by Ctrip, and I was fooled. If Ctrip focuses on economic benefits instead of the quality of the hotel itself, I would recommend such a hotel. To hit the brand, after all, you also have competitors. Supplementary comment May 2, 2007: One more thing, broadband speed is ""extremely fast"", two laptops, one hotel broadband, one CDMA handheld broadband dial-up Internet access, playing games in Lianzhong, wired network speed is not better than wireless , I dropped the line a few times, and gave me a lot of points, woo... "
1	I read this book and think the plot is good, it writes Qi Ran's love for Bingyi very well, especially the moment Bingyi died, I feel a little sad. The best place is to let Bingshuo go back to see them and recognize each other, so that Bingyi no longer has regrets~~ I personally think that the extravaganza is even better~~ I love seeing Bingyi and Wei together (although it seems a little sorry to pray Of course), it’s good to see that they all have their own happiness~~ But why the author doesn’t give in and kills and is also happy~ Although it looks good now, but I still want to see the love ambassador~~*_* 
0	In a word, bad! Basically there is nothing to eat for breakfast, the rooms are also very poor, and the nearby transportation is not convenient. The supporting facilities and services are average 
1	T6570, 2G RAM 250G hard drive, the new NVIDIA G105M 256M independent display, led screen is bright and clear without glare, RAMBO DVD burner, megapixel wireless camera, plus THINKPAD brand, this price is very reasonable, the disconnection problem may be a software problem , I haven't found it yet! ! ! 
1	"The painting style of ""Baby Koala Eats"" is what I like very much. It is a more delicate style with harmonious and bright colors. The images of baby koala and little hamster Pippi and father koala and mother koala are very cute. It is very three-dimensional. I like the delicate and beautiful pages of the book for my daughter. The baby koala's rice is mashed potatoes and peas. After reading the book, I immediately bought peas and potatoes for my daughter. After they were cooked, she I love it very much. It should be available to babies over two years old. The quality of the paper is relatively thick, but it will reflect light under the light at night. I don’t know if it’s bad for children’s eyes. So let’s look at it during the day. "
1	The price is good, the design is more beautiful, the appearance is also good, and there are many things to send. Just change the Rising sent to something else! 
1	what! Can finally score! Five stars! ! ! Great! 
1	A very practical machine. When adding memory, there is no small lid on the back that can be opened. It should be under the palm rest, or call 8009908888 to ask. When you take it apart, you will know that the heat dissipation is quite good, and the material used in the machine is very good and very strong. 
0	It's really an old hotel.. The hardware is not good and the service is OK. I ordered a business double room but the space is smaller than the average hotel double room when I enter it. It is really a name... 
1	The sound effect is good, the heat dissipation is acceptable, and the laptop is enough. The battery is currently good. When you first use it, you can burn a disc or download it over the wireless network. It can last for more than 3 hours. 
1	"Why do you always feel that the author's books are always full of sadness? I thought ""Victorius"" is gray enough, but this book is actually depressing from beginning to end...Whenever I think that a new character is about to appear on the stage, I find that it is dead again... But in terms of creating the atmosphere, it is really in place. The mood has been wandering before nervousness, fear and sympathy. It is a pity that the story looks like a sequel, and there is no mention of the results. Some decisive characters have vacillating personalities... .It is particularly annoying that there are too few follow-up mentions of the characters in ""Victorius""! "
0	I sent the wrong book and I still don’t know how to return it? Dangdang's after-sales service is really as bad as stated on the Internet! ! ! 
1	Good things, good design, exquisite workmanship, reliable quality, and fast delivery from Jingdong! The quality of JD’s items is relatively safe, there are no major problems, the packaging is good, and the delivery speed is praised. Basically, it can be shipped on the same day. The thing was just used, it was pretty good, better than expected. 
1	It is very different from the general travel notes, from the artist's unique perspective to narrate what he has seen, personal impressions, and current events. It feels refreshing. There are mainly two parts in France and Italy. I personally feel that the part written in Italy is much better than that in France. It feels more like a guest (he actually bought the house) to describe his experience in a subjective and in-depth mood. I feel that he really likes this place in Italy. And the part of France feels like a travel note handing in homework, completely like a short-term tourist or a passer-by.

0	Just like the introduction of this book, it is a book that parents don't like. The protagonist in the book is designed to be ugly, and the child cried when he saw it. The content is very simple. A dozen or so pages are all behaviors that parents don't let their children do. I don't know if older children will learn David's way or can learn from it instead of doing it. 
0	The machine configuration is uneven, the CPU is very high, the hard disk is small, there is no camera, and there is no Bluetooth. These two should be the configuration that should belong to the business. No accessories are sent, and there is no CD-ROM such as installation and driver. I'm so stingy! The hard drive should be smaller, but it should also be equipped with a 7200 rpm

0	I booked a double room and found it was a double room. I saw that the bed was still big, so I was lazy to negotiate a room change. The bathroom cold water stall often produced hot water, almost burned out, and the toilet paper was poor. It passed. The front desk staff did not wear uniforms, the service was very average, and it was far worse than the listed Samsung. The price of 280 is not worth it. The only thing I am pleased is that the gate security commanded parking is very active, very enthusiastic, and very good I won't live here next time. 
0	"The book ""Seeking a doctor is worse than seeking self"" is very practical. I have recommended it to many friends. Look at my order. Several of these books were bought for or for friends. My friends said I was They have become ""big fools"". In fact, it’s not that I can fool you, it’s that the book is really good. In terms of marketing, selling good new products is called marketing. Selling bad products is called cheating. I introduce good products to my friends. Obviously, benefit should not be included in fraudulent sales. "
1	Currently in the 4 star hotels in Jiangmen the most cost-effective. It is more convenient to eat and shop around. Hotel facilities are relatively old. 
1	The room facilities are outdated and the room is full of musty smell. The network charge is 1 yuan per minute and 100 yuan per day, which is simply a grab. The restaurant on the top floor is great, with a beautiful view of the Huangpu River. .

1	Because it is a new guest room, the room facilities are not bad, and the room service is also very good, but the hotel service is not good, the food in the western restaurant is not very good, the breakfast is OK, the location is not bad, it belongs to the city center. It's just that parking is not convenient, so I will consider staying next time. 
0	The price of Ctrip is 360 yuan per room, and I see that other customers who check out at the same time are 298 yuan. Ctrip told me that it was four stars. What I saw was a worse room than Jinjiang Inn. The paint peeled off in the elevator and the stainless steel pipe in the bathroom was rusted. There must be no star rating. The place is also in an alley. I live in room 1512. The only thing is that Koreans come and go frequently. It is recommended that Ctrip negotiate with the hotel. I have already complained to the lobby, and such a room is not worth the price of 360 yuan. Ctrip should go to the hotel to conduct an on-site survey before recommending it to guests. 
1	The configuration is relatively complete, and all fingerprint recognition is available. The screen is very good, and it looks very comfortable. 
0	The floor is dirty, very uncomfortable, the hot water is hot and cold, the bathroom is too dark, and it is very different from when I checked in two years ago. I originally booked to stay for two nights, but I only stayed for one night. The front desk service was not good, and I swiped my card For most of the day, I still didn't succeed, so I said that the machine was broken, which is really bad... 
1	The hotel is facing the street, but it is still recommended to live in a room facing the street, because there is a central air-conditioning at the back of the hotel and the noise is not small. There are not many cars on the road before 11pm in Weihai, so the rooms facing the street should be quiet. The service is good and friendly. The location of the hotel is also good, right in the city center. You can consider living in Weihai in the future. 
0	I don't know what standard it was rated as a four-star hotel, it is the worst I have ever seen. The facilities are outdated and the environment is noisy, so parking fees are charged. The price is not low, and the price/performance ratio cannot be expressed in words. In short, there is only one word for the difference, two words for the bad, and three words for the very bad. Even if it's free, it won't live anymore. It is recommended that Ctrip not cooperate with others, which will affect Ctrip's reputation. 
1	There is nothing wrong with check-in. The front desk is arranged on the 23rd floor. It is really bad and smelly when you get out of the elevator. I still have this smell when I enter the room. I'm about to vomit. I really couldn't bear it, so I called the reception and asked for a room change. Later changed to the 39th floor. The waiter said it was an apartment building on the 23rd and 24th floor. Someone was cooking. gosh! ! ! It also shows that the hotel does not value Ctrip's customers. If it is a member of their hotel ACCOR, it will definitely not be arranged on the 23rd floor. Another strange question is, why does Ctrip always have no breakfast? There are no hotels. It feels like Ctrip ate our breakfast. 
1	The workmanship is very good (I like it except I don't like the piano paint), and the price is very high. For my dad to use the Internet, the elderly need a widescreen notebook, this configuration is very suitable for his use. It feels better than expected. 
0	"Check-in is fast. When I checked in, I told me that there is no room in the deluxe room I booked, and I was upgraded to an apartment for free. First of all, here is a question. Why does the Ctrip system show that the room is in good condition when booking 1 day before check-in, and there is no room when I check in after 11 noon the next day? Is it the hotel's problem or Ctrip's problem? Second, I did not see the price of ""apartment"" on the room price list at the front desk, so I asked the front desk in doubt, what kind of room is an apartment? The answer is a room that is usually closed. There is no other way but to live in an apartment. When I enter the room, it is super large. In fact, it is two bedrooms and one living room. Both rooms have beds. But looking at the facilities and items inside, I almost fainted. , The beds are not evenly laid, even a three-star hotel. The floor of the bathroom was dirty and uncomfortable. Looking around the room, I couldn't find a service manual, so I didn't know anything about the hotel's telephone description, CCTV channel selection, etc. There is no master switch in the room, no DND, no bathrobe, no sewing kit. . . Even the necessary items for a 3-star hotel room are not available here! ! ! I was very angry. The serviced apartment does not have a star rating. I booked a 5-star hotel, but gave me an apartment without a star rating and no service. In fact, I need such a big two-bedroom apartment for one night. Hall room? The key is the inconvenience, which I cannot accept. Since it is an upgrade, it should be upgraded to a hotel room with star definition! Because I didn't see the hotel's 5-star room, I can only score this point. I hope the hotel will take this as a warning, and I hope Ctrip can reflect on why this is the case! "
1	The performance is good, the heat is not much. In normal operation, the GPU temperature is 50 degrees, the new battery's use time is 3.3 hours (vista has been balanced), the 3Dmark 2006 score is a little over 2000, and the Vista own score is 4.4. Beautiful appearance, beautiful system interface 
1	"After reading the book, I have this different feeling: it turns out that international relations, military struggles, and political arrangements all have ""conflict strategies"" in it. As a pioneer of ""game theory"", Mr. Xie Lin's thinking is profound and comprehensive, but he has made this theory clear and clear through examples. To talk about feelings, you may need to read it a few times to form your own thoughts. The quality of translation does not seem to be ideal, especially some theoretical explanations. "
1	The overall standard has not reached the five-star level, and the work efficiency of the front desk is relatively slow. The location is not bad, easy to find, the hotel's morning tea is not bad. Additional comment May 26, 2008: Wrongly written, it is a four-star 
0	The system cannot be accessed normally, and the hard disk has abnormal sounds. It should be normal for products to encounter quality problems, but Jingdong’s service attitude is really unsatisfactory: it is extremely irresponsible for the processing of replacement applications and various production difficulties. Strongly request Jingdong exchange! 
0	It is easy to leave fingerprints. You should buy a white one. The keyboard is loose, and the bottom is not close enough. There are two partitions but the size is too unreasonable. The c drive is actually divided into 70G, and the xp netbook is completely unnecessary. it is okay! 
0	Stayed several times, the price is high, the room is poor, and the bed is small. If it weren't for these hotels in Yibin on Ctrip, I wouldn't be staying anymore. Went today, the service attitude was very bad, I vowed never to go again. depressed 
1	Good luck, free upgrade, overall is good! The room is bigger than expected, because it is a sea view suite, so the view is very good! 
0	The real Lust Caution article is very short, only more than ten pages, and the remaining two hundred pages are all famous articles before Zhang, so purchase carefully 
0	Poor, I don't know how the room is. It is reserved for guests. In the weather in January, I heard from guests that there is no heating supply. It seems that there are fewer people staying in, and the heating is turned off. How come there is such a hotel. 
1	I stayed at the hotel again on June 19-21, and it was still the same. Asking if the front desk can change the building dust, I always answer that I have to wait for half an hour. I don't know why? Hope the hotel needs to be improved in all aspects! 
0	1) Control the weight again; 2) On weekends, it is 2 delivery a day. I am in Shanghai. I place an order after 17:00 on Friday. It will be delivered after 11 noon on Sunday. slow. 
1	It took six days to read the book. The most touching part is the third chapter of Fenghua. Yun Zheng's death made me cry. Seeing Feng Ge turning his head all night, he couldn't help but sigh. In my heart, I still hope that the heroine can be with Yu Gongzi. Seeing Jun Beiyu's childishness when he knows everything, and the domineering kind of wanting to get his beloved back, I feel helpless. However, to miss is to miss. The last two parts feel a bit scary. They are both lowered and Japanese beasts. I watched them at night, and my back was a little cold. 
1	We stayed in Asia Pacific (Phase II) for a total of four nights from June 21st to June 25th. Originally wanted to stay in this hotel for two days and then to Yalong Bay for two days, but my husband felt it was too tired, so I haven't booked other hotels, and now I think about it. I feel a little regretful. First of all, the service of the Asia Pacific International Convention Center is indeed good. The attitude is relatively cold); the hotel lobby is still quite beautiful, and the swimming pool is also beautiful. Since I repeatedly asked to live on the fifth floor in advance and must have a 100% sea view room, Ctrip did my best (thank you here), The room is relatively old, even my husband who is not particular about it does not meet the five-star standard, but the toilet is a blue theme, very clean and large, and my son and I both like it. I wake up in the morning and I can’t wait to open it The thick curtains give me the first impression: it’s beautiful! It’s awesome! The breakfast in this hotel is so-so. Since we stayed for four days, we ate almost the same every day, and the variety looks quite diverse. But the taste is really not flattering, and the most terrible thing is that except for the room and the front desk (with a vertical air conditioner), there is no air conditioner anywhere in the hotel (not even a ceiling fan). We eat profusely in the morning every day. It's really hard to eat. But the restaurant environment is still good. We went to the third phase for dinner and felt that the environment was better than the second phase, and the restaurant has central air-conditioning (but it seems that the waiters are not afraid of heat, even if the air-conditioning is not turned on). In terms of: good service, good environment, very close to the sea and beach, Sanya is a beautiful place. My son and I were a little reluctant when we walked, but because Sanya itself is a very hot place, this hotel has no air conditioning, too It's hot, so next time I go there, I will stay there unless I go in winter, and I won't stay in this hotel in the rest of the season (what a pity) 
0	Is there any mistake? Why didn’t my review be posted? Your website only safeguards the interests of the hotel and does not care about the customer’s feelings? I’m still catching a cold! What kind of world is this.... Additional comment March 13, 2008: I only have two descriptions for the service of this hotel, which is too bad. The quality of the waiter: one point. The heating is so small that I caught a cold and it is still not good. Feedback from the hotel May 20, 2008: You were unhappy during your stay at the hotel Experience, we are very sorry. We will work hard to correct your opinions and strengthen the education of employees. We sincerely hope that you will come again! 
1	The books are brand new. With 9 hours of power-on time, the subject still feels OK. I haven't played games yet, and the heat dissipation is still acceptable! 
1	It was decided yesterday morning and arrived yesterday afternoon. The speed is good! I also insisted on letting the delivery person wait until I have inspected the goods before leaving. The service quality is good! The books look very good. I was watching movies and playing games. The price of this configuration is very suitable! 
0	The difficulty of words is much worse, some are very commonly used and some do not need to be known at all. They can't enhance the memory after reading them, which is boring. 
1	The screen is very beautiful, very pleasing to the eye, all the indicators are expected before the purchase, the quality is good, and the appearance also inherits the traditional HP model 
1	The price is cheap, authentic products are available, not bad. For this computer to pay attention to JD.com every day, I finally snatched it. I also brought one with my friends. I like it very much. 
0	weight! It’s a pity that I don’t have a DVD-RW, so I’ve got a total of 12 CDs in the system disk. The battery power is less than 2 hours. It’s a pity that Vista is very slow and painful. 
1	A really worthwhile set of books, with nice stories and beautiful prints. recommend. 
1	The price is good. The built-in system is troublesome if you don’t install the system. After you get it, you can do a one-key restore as soon as you get it. 
1	After reading this book, some people may think that the whole book is saying that just thinking about it can be successful, but the truth is not that simple! What the author advocates is to maintain a good mentality when facing difficulties in life, poverty, disease, etc., and think for the good, things can develop for the good. If you just have negative thoughts blindly, then It will only get worse as you think about it, but it will not produce good results. The law of attraction is still very helpful to me, and now it has helped me a little bit in my life and work. Hope it will get better and better! I strongly recommend everyone to read this book! 
0	The location is relatively remote, but it is not the main reason for not liking it. Room 280, the decoration is terribly bad, the carpet is oily and black, and I dare not step on it barefoot after a bath. Sanitation and disinfection are definitely not in place. Broadband is unstable and often drops. 
0	Interpreting history in a ridiculous way may earn applause from the big guys, but after a serious thought, it seems that there is not much left. The preface expert may not have read this book seriously. . . . The language in the book is not rigorous enough, and the logic is a bit confusing. . . . I can't read anymore, (two) (three) still lying on the side quietly. . . . (4) I'm afraid I won't buy it. . . . . . 
1	Small and beautiful! Internet, text and photo editing speed is still ideal. The size of the screen and keyboard is good! 
0	The seams of the shell are too open in some places.I bought two with my colleagues, one is good, and the other has this problem, indicating that the consistency is not very good. 
1	1. The look is pretty; 2. The price/performance ratio is relatively high; 3. The screen is very good and the brightness is enough; 
1	The natural environment is first-class, and the interior decoration of the hotel (attached building) is also quite good, not luxurious, but very clean and refreshing. The overall feeling is quiet and freehand. 
1	The shell is covered with a film, the screen is covered with a film, and the keyboard is also covered with a protective film, which saves tens of dollars and less effort. The gifts are also top-notch, easy to use and applicable. The keyboard feels good. The enter key is good and the contact area is large. 
1	Staying in Jinquan feels good overall, clean and tidy, broadband Internet express, the price is relatively good value, there is a Wal-Mart supermarket nearby, the transportation is very convenient, the service is in place, and I will live next time. 
1	The battery life is good. It can be used until you get home when you look at the stocks and overtime. Yes, 3 hours early and 4 hours noon 
1	"I didn’t really like this kind of illustrator reading material. I don’t think there are many, it’s a bit uneconomical. Hehe, but Ah Li's story is really loved. It’s a few meters longer than Jimmy’s ""supposedly"" story. I saw Ah Li and his mother online. The dialogue, asking what is death, the dialogue between Ari and the tree, and asking what is life are all thought-provoking! It is worth repeating! "
1	The price of the coroutine is better. Will stay here next time on business trip. The rooms are not bad. 
0	The cover is piano lacquer, easy to collect fingerprints, heat dissipation is so-so, the adapter is relatively hot, the left palm rest is a bit hot, nothing else 
1	My mother has diabetes, and our family is very anxious. In addition to drug treatment, it is diet therapy. My mother was arguing that her diet was too monotonous all day, so she accidentally found this book and bought it for her. Mom was happy to see it. This book is written by a well-known domestic endocrinologist. It is highly scientific, with illustrations and texts. It teaches mothers to choose suitable foods, explains why they are adapted to diabetic patients, how to cook them, and what foods can be combined with them. My mother strictly followed the instructions in the book, her blood sugar was well controlled, and she no longer felt monotonous in her diet. We are also very happy! 
1	The rooms are not bad, classic and modern! The front desk service is average, basically can't smile! The location is not bad, especially for young people who like digital products! 
1	This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel, and it feels like the first time I have lived in the room facing the Liujiang River. The view is better, but this time the road in front of the hotel has been repaired and the traffic is very convenient. The hotel staff is still as always Smile service, I especially recommend the revolving restaurant on the 30th floor. Come here for dinner when night falls, and the scenery on both sides of the Liujiang River is beautiful. However, this hotel is not suitable for long-distance calls, 1.8 yuan/minute, which is the phone charge I have ever stayed in The highest one. Hotel feedback August 7, 2008: Thank you very much for your support and love to our hotel. Liuzhou Hotel is committed to building the most cost-effective hotel in Liuzhou. The high-rise viewing rooms on floors 24-26, decorated by our hotel according to the five-star standard, are about to be completed. We look forward to your visit! ! 
1	[Recommendation book] It can not only create an environment for children to learn English, but also cultivate feelings with children. Kill two birds with one stone. However, I advise parents not to be too anxious for success, but to take it slowly. 
0	The mouse is not easy to use, it is very tight, and it is made of metal; the volume of the computer speaker will be reduced during video, and it is difficult to hear the other party. 
0	The 801.11n wireless network card is not easy to find a router to match. I was a little dissatisfied with the speed of JD’s delivery. It took 4 days to find the information on the ems website. ems goes very fast. The goods will be received 5 days after placing the order. It only took a day to check the goods from the ems website. 
1	1. The workmanship is very fine and the details are very good. SONY's consistent style, I like it very much. This attitude is worthy of respect. 2. The floating keyboard is particularly comfortable and the sound is low. 3. The performance is powerful, and it is also handy to run large software and games. 4 .It is still very quiet. 5. The memory is a single 2G, suitable for upgrading. 
1	The content of each book is good. It is not as sad as it is introduced. The life and death of humans and animals is a natural thing. As long as you speak slowly to your children in daily life, you will accept it. I read three of them to my children under 4 years old. He listened very carefully and paid attention to the content. The structure of the story is somewhat similar, but the language is good and the pictures are good. The only flaw in the beauty is that there are typos and omissions, which is a pity. Thinking about the books we read when we were young, there were never typos, which made me miss the rigor of the scholars at that time. 
1	After receiving this book, although there is almost no time for one person to watch the baby, I still squeezed all the time to read it in two days. This is really the best parenting book I have ever seen. ,, let me have a guiding light on the way of educating my son. I reviewed some of my usual habits and found that there are several points mentioned in the article. I also know that a little detail of my mother will almost affect the baby's life. I really thank the writer. There is such a good book published. I am really glad that I saw this book when my son was one year old. . Fortunately, everything has to be corrected 
1	The quality and service are good. I also heard a friend introduce to buy things here, and I feel pretty good overall. This is also my first online shopping. My first time dedicated to me Jingdong. Haha. 
0	A Canadian uses Chinese poor English as a demonstration to tell you what is correct English. Not to mention that you can't learn a few words and accurate expressions in this way, and the author's mocking attitude is also unacceptable: Yes, you are a native English speaker, so what? The price and content are not equal, not worth it. 
1	I bought it for a friend and put it together with my T400. It is not much different. It is a little thicker. It is almost the same from a distance. My friends like it very much. At this price, the price is good. 
0	I have never seen a hotel like this. The price is not cheap, the equipment is very old, the room is dim, and the exterior and interior are very dirty.It says that there is a wide loan and it costs 20 yuan. 
1	My friend is talking about psychology, and under her influence, she likes books in plain black. People with professional knowledge are very admirable. In the book, Su Hei uses the cases she has contacted as an opportunity to convey an attitude to readers: To love others, you must first learn to love yourself. When two different individuals are together, there will be a lot of contradictions and misunderstandings. The cases in the book are very extreme. In our terms, many people have gotten a bit of a horn and love becomes a kind of injury. After seeing the love concept of all living beings, we found that many situations were forced out by ourselves, so to change, we must first know how to love ourselves. 
1	The price is good, the sis chipset is in use, the speed is very fast, I don't feel any difference, maybe the intel advertising is doing well, ha ha! ! ! 
0	First: Look at hotels and Ctrip from booking. As a diamond customer of Ctrip, I have always been satisfied with the booking efficiency and accuracy, but this time I booked the Le Royal Méridien Shanghai very angry and annoying! Due to the hotel’s new rate policy (for staying more than 4 nights), I denied my confirmed order (for staying more than 2 nights), and I had to negotiate with Ctrip no less than 20 times before resuming the validity of the original order. Although the matter has been resolved, it reflects two important issues: one is that the operation of Le Royal Méridien Shanghai is dishonest, and only after repeated confirmation by Ctrip's customer service did it admit that it had revised the price policy and agreed to charge in accordance with the original order standard; second, Ctrip The mechanism for handling customer issues is slow and irresponsible. Second: Look at the hotel from the experience of staying. 1. The location of the hotel is quite superior. It is Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, surrounded by Chinese and Western restaurants. This is the only advantage I see. 2. The design of the building where the hotel is located is very unique, forming a triangle. The lobby of the hotel is located on the 11th floor. Below are shopping malls. Many elevators have designated starting and arriving floors. There is a direct elevator from the first floor (first floor), but For those who want to check in, they must first go to (L floor) to complete the formalities before transferring. It is more troublesome to go downstairs. All guests must first arrive (L floor) and then transfer. Anyway, staying in these hotels for three days is to go around in the elevator, absolutely waste of time! Business guests do not live! 2. The interior structure and layout of the administrative floor on the 15th floor are very awkward. When the washbasin is used outside the bathroom, it is inevitable that water splashes on the ground and is slippery. There is no place to hang towels. These can be tolerated, but the bedside position is facing the door. There is only one screen in the middle. It feels like lying at the door to sleep at night, the mattress is even more uncomfortable! Too high and too soft, the whole body hurts after sleeping the next day! What's even more unbearable is that the quilt in this hotel didn't even have a sheet, but there was a sheet separated by the quilt, and it was all messed up in the middle of the night! ! 3. There are many high-wattage lights in the room. After a long time of research, I realized that many lights are connected in series and can only be turned on and off at the same time, which is absolutely a waste of energy! This is the so-called Royal Executive Room that I have stayed in with a room rate of more than 2,700. It is really a hotel with extremely poor price-performance ratio. This kind of hotel will be free and will not stay again, because from booking to check-in only very angry and super Trouble, uncomfortable, unworthy feeling. Think twice about latecomers! 
1	"Little Ali doesn't know how to wear pants, so don't wear them at all. When he goes out, he is ridiculed by the little animals. The red-crowned crane is always unstable when standing, and finally he will wear pants when lying on the bed. It seems that the content is very simple, but in terms of psychological and physical characteristics, it is very close to the characteristics of young children. Especially parents with kids in the family, must show this book to their children, the children will definitely be happy. What’s particularly interesting is that when he needs to learn to jump or stand on one foot at a stage during his son’s growth, he always says to him: Hey, I learn to stand like a crane! "" "
1	Reasonable configuration, generous gifts, big brand, trustworthy! With the free 1G memory, the vista speed of 2G is still good! 
0	Since I decided to go out on May 1st and booked it late, there are only three hotels to choose from, so I chose this one. Advantages: The hotel is by the Qingshan Lake, and the rooms should be on the side of the lake. Good. Disadvantages: The room facilities are too simple, at most the standard of an ordinary guest house, the bathroom is too simple, the toilet is terribly dirty, not clean, I don't know if it has been used for too many years or the quality is too poor, the entire toilet They are all black. Don't eat in the hotel. There are farmhouses in the source of Taihu Lake and Tianmu Mountain Scenic Area. Look for the kind with more parking, the price is reasonable, the materials are fresh, and the chicken soup tastes real and fresh... 
0	"I ordered six books, but only five came. The only one missing was ""Twenties, Determines the Life of a Woman"". And after the paper box was torn apart, it was glued together with wide tape. Could it be that after the goods were matched, they were torn apart and then glued together? ? ? ? ? ? "
0	"The book that I ordered on November 21st, and 9 books together with this one, have not been received in 11 days until today! During the call to the customer service to ask, it is disgusting that the customer service rolls his tongue and thinks it sounds good. ""Then I can't help it."" He didn't say to check with me. This service will kill you sooner or later! Dangdang: Your customers will decrease! You wait and see! You go on to fool you! "
1	It seems to be the beginning of an unintentional spoof, but it turns out that everything is within the calculations of the heroine... The beginning of the spoof, the second half is very abusive... The world knows the truth, and she is so beautiful, but it turns out that she just has no emotions. A monster without tears. All the accidental and all the foolish hate speech turned out to be deceit and careful planning... She calculated everything, but in the end she missed that she still has feelings-the man in the red dress who sang the world is her knot, for He, she finally gave up half of the country... 
0	Inventory information is in stock in Shanghai. Why do I have to ship from Beijing when I place an order in Shanghai? It makes me wait for two days in vain. There is only the first day’s record in the logistics information, and there is no subsequent information, so I can’t arrange the time to receive it. In the end, I will pick up the goods myself. This kind of logistics is really sorry for the brand of Jingdong. 
1	The machine is very light and the screen works well. I found no broken/bright spots on this screen. The machine itself has VISTA, and Jingdong’s LINUX description is wrong. 
1	"There are many reasons why mainland property companies and owners and owners’ committees are in turmoil. There are many reasons. ""There is no rule and no circle."" Even with the so-called ""Property Management Regulations"", there is still a lack of a legal internal value evaluation system. The obligation is still just a piece of paper, not enough for all parties to be in their place and seek their duties. Taiwan’s ""Management Regulations on Apartment Buildings"" have few provisions, but they are directly aimed at people's hearts. The interpretation of this book has a lot of humanistic care. Outside of the law, the homeland complex is especially impressive. The scenery of the past is still far away, I hope there is still a world next to each other in the apartment building. "
0	When I first installed the XP system, there was a blue screen. I thought it was a problem with the hard disk. Later, I checked it on the Internet and found that all Asustek had this problem. Modifying the Blos solved the problem. 
0	The VISTA system can't connect to the wireless network. Consulting Lenovo engineers can't solve the problem. It can't be said that people's level is poor, the original software has conflicts, and it is really difficult to find the problem. In the end, I solved it by myself according to the ideas they gave me. If you are unfamiliar with computers, you are in trouble, please connect the network cable honestly. 
0	I really don't know what I'm doing? ? Hasn't it been commented? Misunderstanding! I just turned a few pages, I don’t know, I want to burn it! The preface is not followed by the words, the gourd and the melon, the superficial content seems to be a running account! There are all my own feelings and imaginations, and the scientific basis is insufficient, which is a waste of RMB! It’s not worth buying. It says, “Eat ginger soup when you feel menstrual is about to come or when your stomach hurts on the first day. Try to put a few slices of ginger soup, the hotter the better, plus a few spoonfuls of brown sugar.” Don’t talk nonsense if you don’t know, it will hurt Human. I think maybe you are right! The result was maimed! Drink brown sugar water to replenish blood. And effectively store body heat. Don't drink brown sugar ginger water during menstruation, it is when you have a cold. It can promote blood circulation, promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis, and accelerate metabolism. If you drink brown sugar ginger water during menstruation, menstrual flow will increase, and in severe cases, it will cause uterine bleeding. Reference: Obstetrics and Gynecology. It turns out that it is. It's laughable to be able to publish books at this level! It's still a health book, maybe it's harmful! Mental loss fee! 
0	The conditions are not enough for the star rating, only the price does not allow Samsung, the old house, old facilities, old decoration, the room is very old, it is recommended that Ctrip can explain the room situation when booking, and will definitely not live here in the future. 
0	It is purely the style and quality of the state-owned enterprise guest house. The whole hotel looks rather old. 
1	It's okay, not disappointing. It's about 500m away from Metro Line 2, but it's more convenient to drive by yourself next to Central Ring. 
1	The appearance is fashionable, and the configuration feels relatively high. But there is no modem, although there are not many opportunities to use it, but it is easy to use when you need to fax occasionally. Although it is an LED backlit screen, the color is not better. Among the staff at the pick-up office, there are no technicians. No one has to disassemble and inspect the machine, and no one can answer a simple question. 
1	The price is very high and the price is very suitable! Delivery speed is very fast; cpu performance is much better than intel at the same price; maximum support capacity of 8GB provides a lot of space for future upgrades! System bus 3600MHz is generally 1800MHz; the performance is much better! 
0	"As soon as the book arrived, it was borrowed by a friend. I had already read it. I bought it because of Zhang Ailing. After reading Zhang Zijing's ""My Sister Zhang Ailing"", it can be seen that Zhang is not very enthusiastic towards her brother. This is her character. But once Zhang Zijing went to find her, Zhang Ailing looked very happy that day. Later Zhang Zijing calculated that Zhang Ailing was in love with Hu Lancheng at that time. Many people are not ashamed of Hu Lancheng's improper use of emotions. Of course I am also disgusted, but I also want to say that Hu Lancheng has given Zhang Ai's joy. What a smart woman Zhang is, if it were not for love, she would not be so foolish. The love that belongs to them, let them taste and bear. Hu's writing is indeed good, there is a kind of elegance in it. I don't know if it's that faint atmosphere that once made Zhang Xin moved-""The years are quiet and the world is stable"". "
0	I moved in on May 3rd. The facilities are too old and there is a musty smell. The hotel also charges parking fees. It is strongly not recommended. In addition, the address given by Coroutine is wrong, it is Xunyang Road, not Xunyang East Road. 
1	I thought that boys prefer insect books. I saw so many good reviews and bought them with curiosity. But I was miserable: my daughter pestered me to read insect books to her every day. It took almost half an hour to read a story. My throat is hoarse, she likes it very much. Sometimes, she would play role-playing with me: for example, I am a nagging weevil mother, and she is the wayward weevil boss. . . , The roles are swapped and played, and they never get tired of it. So far, I have finished reading 3 books. Every time she finishes reading a book, she will compare the introduction and tell me: Mom, I don’t have this one yet, next time I buy the fourth book. . . 
1	The appearance is beautiful and metallic, and the noise is within an acceptable range. Basically, it is not felt. The design of the lock touch screen is very user-friendly. 
1	The product is good and the price is reasonable, but the express delivery is not available in our city, I picked it up in a neighboring city 
0	No system, it’s a torture for the rookie. I don’t send XP driver. The sound card driver on the official website is wrong. I found the right one after looking for a meeting. 
1	The entire hotel is relatively old, but the design of the hotel’s guest rooms is very modern and clean. Except for the relatively small area (the executive floor or the general floor seems to be the same size), everything else is satisfactory. 
0	Started carelessly, formatted and installed XP directly, and found it failed. It took a few hours to install it. There are signs of wear, especially the eight gateway logos. 
1	The environment is really good, facing the sea, quiet, suitable for leisure and vacation, but unfortunately only stayed for one night. The location is relatively biased and it is more convenient to drive by car. Hotel dining is too expensive, I drove out to eat. 
0	general//////////////////////// 
1	Looking at the development history of Wall Street, combined with the current status of China’s financial market and various problems, I can’t help feeling that the gap between us and others is too great. The development of the US capital market to the current level of maturity has experienced constant negation, destruction and reshaping. , Has experienced even the lesson of blood. It is impossible for us to do it overnight. The hardware can easily reach the standard, but people's hearts cannot be changed in just a few decades. We will continue to suffer in the future. After the dumb loss, whether we can change, absorb and innovate instead of becoming conservative and stagnant, I think it is the key. 
1	The location of the hotel is very convenient. It is very close to the first floor and the night market. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is very affordable for 10 yuan. The service is good but the room is large but the facilities are a bit old, especially the bathroom is small. 
1	The price-performance ratio is super high. I bought it for a friend. The most important thing is that it has more than 7 hours of battery life. It is super value and great! 
1	Jingdong’s service is “very efficient and fast”. The order in the afternoon of the first day received the goods in the afternoon of the third day. The courier claimed that I was not in the company during the Dragon Boat Festival so I would not deliver it. Unfortunately, my boss is not so kind . JD’s customer service was on vacation but no one was waiting for recording, which caused a lot of waste of phone bills. 
0	The price is high and there are no gifts. Running Vista is a bit slow, it is better to install a DOS, or you can reduce the price. 
1	My son is 5 years old this year and he is in a small kindergarten class. Children's Day is approaching, and I am thinking about what kind of gift I will prepare to surprise my son. The day he received the book, he happened to go to the post office with his son. Once he got home, he eagerly opened the book and read it all at once, especially the expressions of the animals and characters in the book, over and over again. Turning over and comparing, suddenly, he shouted in the room: Mom, this is the best gift I received on Children's Day! Seeing my son happy, I am also very happy. 
0	There is no Internet access in the specially reserved broadband room, and the hotel has no technical staff 
1	"Have a crush on an O-shaped GG. He is a very calm person, even introverted. At first I thought he was a Type A person, but later discovered that he still has the characteristics of Type O. For example, ""Once you like the other person, you can't just'wait and see from afar' anyway."" I have been expecting that I can impress him, but finally there is a girl next to him...I just know, the so-called Stupid, but I didn't meet the person I like. Sigh, I bought this book and read it one by one, and found that it was really similar to him. To commemorate my failed crush. "
0	1. Slightly thick 2. A preliminary test was done on the hard disk, the read and write speed is average, but the CPU occupancy rate is high. 3. The driver CD included with the machine is only vista driver, which is not suitable for XP. 4. The card reader is a bit stuck, which is inconvenient. 
0	I ordered a total of 6 books this time, and only sent me 5 books, but this one was missing. As for why there weren’t, no one gave me an answer, and I didn’t say a word! 
0	I agree with the previous reviews. This is my first time staying here. The room settings are very unreasonable and the bathroom is super abnormal. It is not recommended! I often stay at the Yuhuangge Hotel on Yuhuangge North Street on business trips. It has a good location and is a good place to stay quiet in the middle of noisy. The standard room is only about 150. There is also a swimming pool where you can swim for free. I think the price/performance ratio is quite high. No on Ctrip, taxi drivers know it. It is strongly recommended that Ctrip also include this hotel. 
1	The configuration is very good. It is quite smooth to use, heat dissipation is OK, hard disk partitioning is very easy, and the staff in Xiamen have a good attitude. 
1	4099 snapped up, but also used a 2000-50 coupon, it feels very worthwhile. This is an integrated graphics card, I think it's enough. At the time, I was still hesitating in the v450a-tfo and this one. I bought it on the impulse when I saw it. Now I think this is a wise move. It's enough for normal online office movie chat. In a word, just suit yourself! In addition, the book is brand new and unopened, with a perfect screen, so happy~ 
0	The hotel facilities are outdated, because it is a business trip, you need to use broadband. After changing to three rooms, there is no signal. The TV in two of the rooms also has a problem. I don’t know what people do at night. The quality of breakfast is really poor. Almost. It is the worst four-star hotel I have ever stayed in. 
0	Fingerprint collectors have poor shell technology, softness, and heat generation. The character is not good, I found a dark spot, and didn't cry. . . You just need 3 points, I can change the machine, I'm depressed 
0	A bit heavy! Although I am very strong, but it is hard to carry! Especially the shoulder bag, I bought a backpack! It's not bad! But it is hot on the back in hot weather! Just throw it at home! Never brought it again! Just now! It started well! After using it for three days, the fan started to make a small noise! It affects the mood! 
0	Very poor sound insulation, difficult to find, old factory renovation, small reception at the door almost found the hotel next door, Shanghainese stingy 
0	The heat dissipation was poor and the system was unstable. The system was damaged after the first use and the system was repaired. However, Lenovo's smart repair system is very powerful and convenient, and the battery life is very short. I hope that Jingdong can fast forward to six-cell batteries. But my regret 
1	I chose this hotel after a friend of Siemens recommended. I booked a deluxe room and I felt pretty good overall. The hotel is small, 7 floors in total. But the decoration is very elegant and delicate, a bit like the Amberley Hotel in the UK. When I checked in, I found that there were many Japanese people here, and I heard that it was from Toyota. The room is floor-to-ceiling windows, very clean, with a view of the garden. The bed is comfortable and the breakfast tastes good. The service here is very good, not as bad as the previous friends said. I heard that I was from Siemens and offered to help me upgrade! And broadband is free, great! 
1	The hotel is great, and the environment is first-rate. . So beautiful,. . Air, greening,. human traffic. . spa. . You can go again if you have the opportunity. . . Ctrip has also arranged many things through its best efforts. . 
0	"When I wanted to buy it, I only placed an order after seeing a lot of good reviews. I didn’t expect that it was not as good as others said. Especially the one that beats the monster. The drawing is so disgusting! The child was scared to cry when he saw it! I dare not sleep! I bought a book and brought new troubles! Compared to ""Frog Frog"", ""Bumpy Jumping"", ""Little Bear Maomao"", this Carmela is much inferior! This book is not It is too suitable for children before the age of six. "
1	First of all, it is very cost-effective. Buying 512 at this price is very worthwhile; secondly, the quality is still very good. After all, HP's brand is still trustworthy, and it is worthy of being the world's number one notebook supplier. 
1	When I first read it in elementary school, I read it again and my heart was overwhelming, but it was only my childhood yearning for heroes; I read it again in junior high school, and I got a preliminary understanding of what is good and evil, rewards and punishments in the world; high school was busy with exams. Although the university has no time to take care of it, it can be used for fun when you are nervous; now that you have gone to university, you have more time to buy a book as if you are a teenager, but you can use a more mature mindset to examine and study. ——MY LOVE!!! Both printing and typesetting are very good, I think your font is very good, compact but not crowded, it looks effortless. 
0	The delivery was not on time. The rest day was stated, but it arrived on a working day. And express delivery threatened to accept it. There was no response from the customer service complaint. Had to seek the help of the media. It seems that this is the last time I have been shopping in Dangdang. 
0	I didn't know that Ctrip would choose this store, except for the location, it was useless! The room is old, the wires of the mattress are all out, and the air-conditioning temperature of the single-numbered room is above 30 degrees in June. No air conditioning for breakfast. The young lady made random calls, all around 12 o'clock. 
1	During the summer vacation, I took my family to Taiyuan for a vacation. I stayed for four days, three Jins, and three days at China World Trade Center. Although the former is far inferior to the latter in terms of hardware facilities, the latter is far inferior to the former in terms of services. One night my wife had a stomach problem at night. Not only did the waiter bring a traditional hot water bottle (the wife said it was warm all night), the attendant brought several stomach medicines, and what was even more surprising was that when she left the house the next morning, another one The waiter also greeted the wife if her stomach was better. We were very moved. The sense of service here seems to be well-trained. Even the cleaners in the lobby who are in charge of cleaning are very polite in dealing with the details when meeting guests. We took this as an example to teach children a vivid lesson. I think Sanjin was rated as a four-star for its service level. Hotel Feedback August 13, 2008: Dear VIPs of our store: Thank you very much for your evaluation of our store. We are very honored. . We will continue to do our best to provide you with our services as always. Welcome to our hotel again, I wish you success in your work, good health and happiness in your family! (Our store has guest feedback permission on Ctrip.com from today, so I will reply to you immediately, thank you again for your support!) 
1	A 2G DDR 800 memory is added. Installed XP DELL OEM version. There is no problem with speed. I usually do some word processing. The Wi-Fi signal is very good, better than the D630 I used last time. 
1	The early part of the novel is relaxed and humorous, like clouds and flowing water, from Zhuo Min and Yang Yi discovering that they have a connection with Zhao Lie. It turns out that their first sight is not deja vu, but they have already seen each other. Later, the baby was hit and Zhuo Min disappeared. , I couldn't control my emotions, I kept crying and watching. The plot of the novel is not perfect, but the overall beautiful text, the tortuous fate of the protagonist, and the funny Li's humor make the novel fascinating! How eager to meet an infatuated man like Yang Yi, a little cynical, a little glib, and a little witty. 
1	The exterior wall of the hotel is being renovated, the entrance is very small, after entering the gate is G floor, and then take the elevator to the first floor Check-in. The hotel room is very small. After entering the door, there is a straight single walkway. After two steps inside, there are two single beds close to the wall on the left hand side. There is a single walkway in the middle, except for these two. There is no other walking space in the aisle. Although the room is small and pitiful, I still feel that it is not bad. The first reason may be that the room is very clean, but the small and clean room gives people a warm feeling. The second reason is that Compared with the Hampton in Midun Road, it is a world. The hotel is very close to the subway station, a 2-minute walk, as long as you can take the subway in Hong Kong, it is very convenient to go anywhere. At night, there are many snacks and food stalls in Guangdong Street near the hotel, which is very convenient. 
0	I can't find a worse adjective to describe this book. I thought it was humorous, but it turned out to be all jokes. Is it funny? Throw away 
0	"A very frustrating hotel, no matter what aspect, especially the personal qualities of the staff, especially the adaptability. Imagine that when the night is very deep and you are about to fall asleep, the front desk calls and asks, ""Is it possible?"" You need to charge some deposit for the room? ""How do you feel? Maybe they seem to have enough reasons. When I exchange sincerity for the hotel is not respect but suspicion, I have been thinking why this hotel is only 5 stars, and It is not 7 stars. It should have received 9 stars, although there is no such perfect home in this world. "
0	The graphics card is really not good. If there are other operations when watching rmvb movies, the screen will get stuck, but after all, it is a netbook and can be tolerated. 
0	It contains the trial version of Norton. Once activated, the computer immediately becomes very slow and slow, and the system is restored again. It's hard to partition yourself. The position of the display screen is lowered, so you need to adapt slowly. 
1	The machine looks very elegant at first glance, and the touch panel is also very novel. It's not bad to buy this configuration for less than 5,000. The design of the new mold is much more beautiful, more beautiful than the T series, and the sound quality is improved a lot 
1	The service of the hotel staff is very standard, and the breakfast is rich. Close to the road, the surrounding environment is a bit noisy, and there are large trucks honking their horns very early. It may be due to living too high (living on the 6th floor of the top floor). There is no hot water for half of the bath at night, and it takes about 1 minute to slowly come in. This is more unbearable in winter. 
1	Today I finally finished it all, except for the appendix. Still have something to say. First of all, seeing the content of the last chapter about Miyamoto, I can't help but have a more interesting idea: send all Japanese under 20 years old to study in the United States...In short, this book is not a loss, it is an award. best seller. All aspects of writing are pretty good. 
1	The price is high, it seems that hotels in Lianyungang are expensive. Breakfast is not good. The room is not bad, and the view from the window is okay. The most important thing is that the windows of the room are soundproof. The bed is small, and the bed is better than the Pearl Marriott. 
1	It’s convenient to live here if you work in Nanshan District. There are cars in all directions at the door, but it’s a bit noisy. 
1	The price of 5199 is very acceptable, the appearance is very beautiful, the 15.4-inch screen looks very comfortable, the independent small keyboard is very convenient, the heat dissipation is good, the small mouse is very cute 
1	Small size; six-cell battery lasts for a long time, estimated to last 6-7 hours; metal incense silver, brushed workmanship; good heat dissipation, working for a period of time without feeling soup; fan sound 
1	The room facilities are relatively outdated, and the air-conditioning sound is relatively loud. The swimming pool charges the guests of the superior room, and the charges are as high as the outside charges. I find it unacceptable. The swimming pool is too deep. I told the waiter inside and I didn’t care. Breakfast was average 
1	It's relatively small and beautiful in white. Turn off the Bluetooth and camera, the battery can be used for less than 5 hours. 
1	Perfect screen! The appearance is very good, the keyboard area is also very high-grade when opened, and there is a row of function keys, which is very convenient, a variety of interfaces are complete, and it also comes with genuine VISTA, but I also hope that the system is not cheaper Better. VISTA is really not available, and XP must be installed. 
1	The price is really good, and the HP machine is more troublesome to install the system! It is made by Compal in Kunshan. I don’t have to talk about it. The heat dissipation is okay, but it can’t be super good! 
0	It would be great if XP was pre-installed, this system is really not available. It is said that the system is difficult to install, so I will bring it to the company tomorrow to find someone who knows how to do it. 
1	This novel is sad and heartbreaking. It is unacceptable for anyone like Charlie to be strangled by a relentless war. But Xiaotuo has to endure this pain. His family is so unfortunate , So that his growth is full of shadows, but he can feel the happiness that life brings him. Seeing this, I feel that my life is too ordinary, too lack of color, we have so many superior things, but we have not been able to live wonderfully, and keep complaining, this is really sad. Xiao Tuo's strength has taught me a lot. 
1	When installing the system, I chose Tomato Garden at first, but I didn’t succeed. I switched to Windows 7 and the process went smoothly. 
0	I am not very influenced by others, nor did I buy this book when it was the hottest. In fact, I didn’t know about this book. Before Dangdang recently encountered it, I only bought it because it had so many comments. Got it. I regret it after reading it. There is no substantive content, personal little feelings, not typical, nor classic, and his company is not a cutting-edge company,,,, don’t know how others read, comment,, didn’t buy, don’t buy No matter, of course, I don’t know how Dangdang’s recommendation is. 
1	"The many funny books I bought were far-fetched funny. After ""Empty Miles"" I never saw a real funny novel again. This novel made my eyes bright. . . The optimism and tolerance of the hostess made my heart follow her up and down, hoping that she can turn to her beautiful male husband with a safe payment, always suddenly make a big turn in the affectionate bridge, people can't help it. The hilarious is pretty good-looking. Recently I have read too many tragic texts. It's not bad to see this adjustment. I will read it a second time occasionally. . . "
0	Advantages: It is indeed a standard ocean view room, you can see the sea from the window. The traffic is more convenient. There is a RT-Mart on the opposite side. You can take a walk on Binhai Road at night. Disadvantages: too much; 1. The facilities are too old, the carpets are covered with black stains everywhere, and the rooms have a strange smell. But it can't be worse than that kind of budget hotel; 2. The hotel rooms and office buildings are connected together, and the corridors of the guest rooms are forced to walk around, which is very insecure; 3. The service level is very poor, and the front desk staff can eat Talking to me with gum, the service is very irregular. 4. I hope to check out at two o'clock, which is acceptable to almost all hotels, but was bluntly refused. Conclusion: I can't kill for the second meeting! 
1	Not bad, facilities are a bit old but acceptable, but the price of 606 does not include breakfast a bit high. The mall and supermarket downstairs are very convenient. Will choose this next time. 
0	I placed an order, but this book was not delivered to me, but other books were delivered, which is really strange. Didn't say why 
0	Everyone must not stay in this hotel; the waiter there seems to be you owe money; especially the front desk; it seems like you killed their whole family; but the charge is indeed a 4-star charge; the air conditioning in the room is like a tractor; I I really don't know that Ctrip is getting worse and worse now.' I can only go to a hotel every time I go to an agreement! 
0	There are only two districts, the rookie won’t divide it by himself, just one more district. The logistics attitude is super bad 
0	<<Lust Caution>> The novel is not good, and I will never read it again~~ This book also relies on Lust Caution as a selling point. Other novels and articles are from Zhang's other books. ~~ 
1	The environment around the hotel is good and it is very convenient to go to attractions. The front desk has a good attitude, and the check-in and check-out speed is very fast. 
0	The price is expensive, the room facilities are old and there is no elevator. The rooms are large, but they are all useless facilities, such as mahjong tables, which take up space and are useless. The water heater socket is located above the shower, which feels unsafe. 
1	"The appearance and workmanship are not bad, quite high-grade, with a lot of bells and whistles and flashy things. Such as graphics card switching function, and fingerprint function and so on. The delivery buddy told me when I was unpacking the box, if it was not a computer, let me hit someone with a brick, which was very cute. However, the express delivery staff stated: ""He will only deliver the goods. If there are fake or defective products or bricks, he will not be responsible. If there is a problem, let me contact Jingdong... That is to say, the inspection on the spot is invalid."" . Hehe, I am fortunate to have a big heart. In addition, after all, things on JD.com are cheap. If something goes wrong, it’s not out of JD.com’s intentions. My old customer still understands it. "
0	It's not very quiet, I don't know if it's the cpu or the hard drive. The place where the power cord is plugged into the power adapter is very loose, it will fall off with a slight movement, and fall off several times during use 
0	1. All 3 USB ports are on the left side, which is very inconvenient. 2. The system driver is not easy to install. 3. The battery lasts a short time. 
0	I bought this book with expectation, and I regret it when I get it! It is extremely unsuitable for children. The pictures are a bit distorted and terrifying. It is easy to cause psychological shadows for children. It is still a good book that is more sunny and clear for children. It is recommended that when Dangdang recommends again, please select carefully. ! ! 
1	"It is not easy to find a good book, especially in this society where commercialization is pervasive. This book is fluent in writing and talks eloquently, which is of great help to understanding the society and history of the late Qing Dynasty. Treating history and historical figures, especially those of Qing Dynasty, we seem to be caught in a paranoid and narrow dead end like ""corrupt and incompetent"", ""retreat"", ""minions"" and ""running dogs"". This book allows us to treat history more rationally. . Suggestion: Look at it in conjunction with the two books ""China's political gains and losses"" and ""Lessons of the 20th Century"" "
1	"Most of the foreigners' books on emotions are very specific and rational. Just like an operating manual, you can understand at a glance and just do it. It may be due to their pursuit of the highest efficiency. This is not the case. The exception is a ""Manual of Men and Women's Emotions"". It also has a complete understanding of the relationship between men and women, very specific and in-depth. If you want to have fewer emotional problems between men and women, just do it. Hehe, it depends on whether you can do it. The printed version is still very good. If you want to understand the emotions of men and women, it is worth reading, but if you want to find some new ideas, this book will definitely disappoint you. "
1	Booked a business double room, the room and bed are big enough. However, the air outlet of the air conditioner is facing the bed, even if the breeze is on, it is still a bit cold. The air conditioner is fixed on the wall, and it is not convenient to walk over to adjust the air conditioner. The TV is a bit small, and it's not flat, which is a flaw. Others are pretty good, the overall room is very clean and the facilities are basically complete. 
1	I booked this hotel on the weekend recommended by Ctrip. The starting price from Wuxi Railway Station is available. It seems that the hotel is in the center of Wuxi. The location is absolutely great! The driver said that it was the former Sheraton Wuxi Hotel in the car. The check-in is all smooth and fast. The MM at the front desk feels well-trained. Although the lobby is small but it feels very cozy, the room is very clean and tidy, the 5-star furnishings in the middle and the middle, you can see that the daily maintenance is still Well done. Now the hotel is engaged in activities on weekends, and the price of more than 500 is also provided with two breakfasts. I feel that it is excellent value for money. I will come to Wuxi next weekend. This hotel is the best choice! Feedback from the hotel on August 8, 2008 Day: Thank you for your support to this hotel! Recently, the hotel has launched a new guest room promotion on weekends. We will continue to maintain the 5-star service standard. Welcome you to stay again and sincerely wish you good health and smooth work! 
0	I don’t know if Tianjin hotels are like this, or it’s really bad here. Generally speaking, if I have a choice, I will definitely not stay here anymore. Dirty words? 
0	The pictures of this book are cumbersome and the quality of the translations is average. My kids don’t like to see other people’s English words and phrases. The translations are very adult. 
1	The difference between the so-called business room and the ordinary room is that there are more computers. For business travelers who bring their own computers, there is no need to add 100 yuan, everything else is fine. Hefei has a poor attitude towards taxis, probably because there are fewer taxis in this city. 
0	The delivery speed is extremely slow. The book ordered on May 5 has not been received until now. I call customer service and say that the delivery is every time. 
1	The article is generally good, but there are too many repetitions of historical data, and I feel that it is not good at every step. The author seems to pay too much attention to the accuracy of history and some ignore the readability and creativity of the novel. It feels like processing some on the basis of historical historical data. It's like using a famous song to fill in the lyrics. Although it is catchy, the originality is a little bit worse. The storyline is still wonderful, the characters are clearly portrayed, and the author's imagination is rich, but the beauty still makes me cry It's really touching, especially the description of the parting of the two lives, it's still a good novel! 
1	Generally speaking, I always live here again, and the company guests are fairly satisfied. It’s super close to the company, go upstairs to work and go home 
1	The imitation of IMAC BOOK AIR is in place and more humane. It is suitable for friends who love IMAC and are embarrassed. At first glance, it looks very bluff, and it is not as laborious to use as IMAC. 
1	This can also be called a four-star hotel? not worth. It’s just that the location is convenient. 
0	Also, if breakfast is a little bit later, there is nothing to eat, and the cooking is very average 
1	"I haven't read too much recently because I am busy preparing for the exam. But I couldn't help the huge temptation, I watched it a bit. I finished ""Bella"" and ""Jacob"" and saw the second chapter. This way of writing is quite interesting. Although I'm used to looking at Bella's point of view, it's pretty good to take a closer look at the werewolf. It's really good-looking, but when I look at it now, I feel that sometimes it is really outrageous, haha~ But I still haven't figured out whether this ending appears in this book~ Come on~ Look good, look good! "
1	Very good hotel, close to the sea. Apart from the bad internet connection on the night of the stay, the others are very satisfied. By the way, it is not easy to get out of the taxi, but the scenery on the road outside the intersection is also good, ha ha. 
0	Check-in experience: Due to the late arrival in Handan, the hotel was fully booked, so I had to stay here. I had booked the Handan Hotel through Ctrip. The facilities were very complete. I felt that Handan Grand Hotel should not be too bad. When I entered the lobby, I felt a stale feeling. A waiter immediately greeted me and asked to help me carry the bag. I declined, but still followed me. He went to the front desk to check in and gave me 4 or 5 books for me to sign. , Gave me a room card and a deposit slip, went upstairs, the waiter had not left my side to help me get the bag, again declined, the waiter kept telling me that their hotel is a state-run hotel. I live on the 4th floor. As soon as I entered the hallway, there was a particularly strong smell of cooking oil smoke. The first thing I felt when I entered the room was fooled. The room was damp, musty, small and shabby. The TV was only 14 or 15 inches. , Black and white, plus snowflakes, you can walk for at most one or two days as soon as you want to finish things. Because I was going out to meet a friend at night, I checked the doors and windows habitually, and found that the windows were not locked, and from the bathroom bathtub to the outside of the window sill was a connected apron. Ask the waiter to ask if you can get the computer and valuables if you leave the room. When it comes to security assurance, I get a arrogant reply: We are like this. Counting from check-in, it took less than 10 minutes before and after, and the attitude was completely opposite. Feeling upset, but I endured it... I wanted to eat some breakfast the next morning and go out to work, because I didn’t send a breakfast voucher, I called to ask if I can eat with my room card. I got the answer when I checked in last night I have signed the book and gave me a breakfast voucher in one bite. After repeated emphasis and explanation, I finally reluctantly let me go for breakfast, but I was extremely reluctant as if I lied to him for breakfast and owed him personal feelings. Quite upset, decided not to eat, check out. The waiter at the front desk ignored him and asked for money after checking out. The deposit was 600, and the room rate was 234 yuan a day. They gave me 66 yuan. Although I was angry, I had to pay clearly for the money. I found that the difference was too outrageous. Give me 300 yuan, and my anger is about to erupt. One of the three hundred-yuan bills returned to me was missing one-third of the area, so she was asked to change it immediately, and the waiter looked up and down to confirm that it was replaced by one-third of the area. Faint. Carrying Baotou strode out the door without looking back, recognizing that sleeping on the street (of course, it is not so miserable) not to be angry, and finally with the help of Ctrip to book the Yanzhao Star Hotel, very satisfied, I think Ctrip's attitude is very good Yes, the service is also very attentive. I have always supported Ctrip. I am a loyal user. I would like to give Ctrip some advice. I hope that Ctrip will carefully screen when choosing a partner hotel. For hotels like this kind of hotel with extremely inconsistent charges and services, I firmly refuse to go outside. , Ning Shao Do not abuse. 
0	This machine is exactly the same as the New Blue S5290, that is to say, it was made by ASUS for the New Blue computer. The screen is a bit gray and other problems are not big 
1	I recommend a deputy general manager of my company. After reading it, he said that the book is good, but he hasn't returned it to me now. He doesn't even believe that this book was written by one person, because sometimes the book planning and collaboration in the publishing industry is a team operation. 
1	"When I bought this book, I had an idea. I just wanted to know more about the Middle East story. Slowly flipping through the book, I was gradually infected by the scene inside. Several times I felt the tears rolling in my eyes—moved. If, if there are more people like protagonists, the world will be better~~If, if someone in China can write such a book (about China), and it can be widely concerned~~~ if ~~No if, these situations can only be left in the imagination~~~Everyone has a charitable heart, but most of them are not fully ""excavated""~~~ "
0	Reading this book gives me the feeling that it is not only good-looking but also very useful. I am an administrator of a foreign company, but I am still a rookie after graduating for more than a year. The knowledge in the book can make up for my lack. I marked the paragraphs that involve the actual theory, which is especially worthy of my reference and research. It is too late to see each other!!! 
0	First: Look at hotels and Ctrip from booking. As a diamond customer of Ctrip, I have always been satisfied with the booking efficiency and accuracy, but this time I booked the Le Royal Méridien Shanghai very angry and annoying! Due to the hotel’s new rate policy (for staying more than 4 nights), I denied my confirmed order (for staying more than 2 nights), and I had to negotiate with Ctrip no less than 20 times before resuming the validity of the original order. Although the matter has been resolved, it reflects two important issues: one is that the operation of Le Royal Méridien Shanghai is dishonest, and only after repeated confirmation by Ctrip's customer service did it admit that it had revised the price policy and agreed to charge in accordance with the original order standard; second, Ctrip The mechanism for handling customer issues is slow and irresponsible. Second: Look at the hotel from the experience of staying. 1. The location of the hotel is quite superior. It is Nanjing Road Pedestrian Street, surrounded by Chinese and Western restaurants. This is the only advantage I see. 2. The design of the building where the hotel is located is very unique, forming a triangle. The lobby of the hotel is located on the 11th floor. Below are shopping malls. Many elevators have designated starting and arriving floors. There is a direct elevator from the first floor (first floor), but For those who want to check in, they must first go to (L floor) to complete the formalities before transferring. It is more troublesome to go downstairs. All guests must first arrive (L floor) and then transfer. Anyway, staying in these hotels for three days is to go around in the elevator, absolutely waste of time! Business guests do not live! 2. The interior structure and layout of the administrative floor on the 15th floor are very awkward. When the washbasin is used outside the bathroom, it is inevitable that water splashes on the ground and is slippery. There is no place to hang towels. These can be tolerated, but the bedside position is facing the door. There is only one screen in the middle. It feels like lying at the door to sleep at night, the mattress is even more uncomfortable! Too high and too soft, the whole body hurts after sleeping the next day! What's even more unbearable is that the quilt in this hotel didn't even have a sheet, but there was a sheet separated by the quilt, and it was all messed up in the middle of the night! ! 3. There are many high-wattage lights in the room. After a long time of research, I realized that many lights are connected in series and can only be turned on and off at the same time, which is absolutely a waste of energy! This is the so-called Royal Executive Room that I have stayed in with a room rate of more than 2,700. It is really a hotel with extremely poor price-performance ratio. This kind of hotel will be free and will not stay again, because from booking to check-in only very angry and super Trouble, uncomfortable, unworthy feeling. Think twice about latecomers! 
1	The price/performance ratio is very high, 2999.00 yuan, which can be configured with a relatively high laptop. Very cost-effective. Basic configurations are available. 
1	This time we booked a sea-view room. The environment was a little better than when we stayed last time. The location is also close to the sea, which is easier to find. Unfortunately, at night there is no hot water, but it is cold water. I wonder if the boiler is too small Or is it another reason? When the hot water was turned on the next morning, it suddenly burned people to death. The change is too big! There is also a higher price of entertainment items. 
1	The front desk service is very good, fast, attentive, and feels good. The room environment is okay, but the mattress is too bad, you can feel the spring when lying on it, it's time to change it. 
0	My classmate Xiaobao especially loves the Carmela series of stories. They have to tell them before going to bed every night. Those cute stories will accompany him to sleep...I myself also like the different Carmela, because it contains The picture is very interesting, talking pictures, I think it is like this, now my son can tell by himself (I want to see the sea), and I hope that after a while, I can be a listener. Dick Camelido, Carmen Berio Corbe, a little six son, a little thorny head and a little fat man, is really fun, and I must recommend it to all children if you have the opportunity 
1	Perfect screen, very good. The speed is super fast. It's easy to install XP. The appearance design is simple. Compared with the 540, it is expensive, and the discrete graphics card is good. Core 2 is really good, faster than my desktop. The battery is used for about 2 hours. 
0	This book is a lie, and it is a lesson after buying this book. After the assembly number came out, I didn’t buy a book anymore, I won’t be fooled 
1	The price is cheap. Although there is no fingerprint recognition mentioned in the introduction, the price is definitely worthy of this configuration! Pretty good! The heat dissipation is also quite good, and it will hardly feel hot! The piano-painted keyboard feels very cool to the touch! Needless to say the configuration, the current mainstream software runs quite smoothly! 
0	The driver disk is only the VISTA driver, and the OS is installed as Linux, I believe 99% of people will not use it. The notebook has no basic expansion Express port. Too few USB ports! 
1	After reading this book, I feel very good. Recommend it to colleagues and friends so that they can learn from it. It feels really beneficial! I have experienced a lot of things, but I didn’t realize that my behavior would have such a big impact on my children. I regretted it! I wonder if it's too late now? 
1	The price-performance ratio is super high. I wanted this machine for a long time, but I finally bought it here, and dare to make a special offer, not bad 
1	Very good, will stay again. There is piano performance in the evening. . . 
1	The appearance and workmanship, I like the appearance very much, or I just like the appearance of thinkpad, the workmanship is solid. The screen effect is good. Compared with the LED screen of another acer, I feel that the graininess is slightly heavier and the color performance is also worse, which is generally good. The keyboard feels as good as ever. The heat dissipation is also very good. After a long time, the keyboard only feels warm. Except for the heat sink, the bottom part is cold. 
1	The laptop is still good, if I use it myself, linux can also make do, but I bought it for my family, so I can only change it to XP 
0	I saw this book serialized in the newspaper and strongly recommended it to my friends. After reading it, my friend said that it was not as good as what I had praised, and the plot was also general. I was frustrated and didn't have the interest to read this book. 
1	I recently had a question that I couldn’t figure out, so I wrote it to everyone to discuss: If you dream back to Xiaowei in the Qing Dynasty, Ruoxi in the startling heart, A Li in Do Not Forget, Ling Er in the worldly jail, and let the snow and ice become hot Chenfang in the middle, Ruohan in your next life, and the dream back to Daqing. Yaohua in the Yaohua, Wanran in the dream, Qiu Ji, etc., etc., if you wear them at the same time , Then what kind of story will happen, I don't know who can write it? 
0	I have paid for more than 2 weeks and I have not received the book. What should I do? I accidentally ordered the delivery confirmation. No one paid any attention to complaints. . . Ooh~ 
0	The room is very poor, the heating is very unobstructed, the quilt is thin, and there is no phone. It is a luxurious room. Do not live next time. 
0	The appearance is a bit rigid, like a battery, so mobile office users are not recommended. It is troublesome to add memory, and it will definitely destroy the warranty sticker. 
1	After several comparisons between the accommodation in Baoding and other hotels, I found that the Bank of China Tower should be the best hotel in Baoding. Anyway, for me, I only need to go to Baoding, now this is my base. Better than the so-called five-star hotel Xiulan Hotel. 
1	The attitude of the front desk is average and the efficiency is better. The room is a bit old but clean and tidy, with complete facilities and a good steam bath. Value for money is worth a visit 
0	I bought it only after the hype was so hot. The so-called greater hope, the greater the disappointment. This is probably what I mean. It's a bit like an article in a magazine like readers. 
1	The hotel is older, but the rooms are okay. Although the hotel is not in the city center, it is close to the company I traveled to, so I stayed several times. 
0	Staying once can make you not want to stay in the second hotel again 
0	The color of the screen is faint. I thought it would be good to use a genuine system, but unfortunately, there is only one partition, which is very inconvenient and inhumane. I called Acer after-sales service to ask if I could help with the partition. I said that I had to pay 100 yuan to reinstall the system. gosh! Sincerely let customers pay more? Next XP on the Internet, use a USB CD-ROM drive and mess around. 
0	The facilities in the room are not ideal as advertised! The price is not as clear as stated on the Internet~~ 
1	The speakers are Dolby's sound effects. I heard from friends that Toshiba speakers are the best in notebooks. I bought it and it sounds good 
0	At the same time of high cost performance, there is a feeling of cutting corners in appearance, workmanship and packaging. The plastic feel is relatively strong, and the mold work is relatively rough! ! ! ! ! ! 
1	I called the hotel to ask for directions. The switchboard said that I didn’t know. I transferred to the concierge. Several guys were not familiar with it. They couldn’t tell the east and west directions, but I finally said a landmark building that gave me a direction. I asked the business center to buy a map to send it up. It said that the concierge was busy, and it had to wait half an hour to unload other guests. Just wait, but after waiting for a full hour and a half, it was only delivered after a phone call. The room is clean, but the bathroom is too small to turn around. I left something when I checked out, and the waiter didn't find it in the round. I found it by calling the front desk and checking again. Generally speaking, it is good to live in such a hotel in Jilin, but the price is not cheap at all. Both hardware and service are four-star standards. 
0	After I placed the order, I reduced the price and sent something. I couldn’t accept this. I still sent the bag~~. I didn’t even apply for price protection, which was unacceptable. 
1	The appearance and configuration are good, and a very cost-effective notebook. I bought it for LP, the performance is good for LP, and the price is good for me^_^ 
1	I have read this book 5 times back and forth, and every time I can’t tell you that I’m moved. I feel that by following the book, I can become a beauty that everyone looks forward to. (Hehe, little girl loves to do day Dream), but I tried to wash my face according to the method, my face really got better. My face was always yellow, but now it's a lot whiter and tender. Even the stingy praising my husband said how to wash his face so pale. More importantly, using the exercises of waist turning and lowering in the book, coupled with facial massage, I feel that the bridge of my nose has increased. It is strongly recommended that women who want to have an infinite charm have a copy. 
1	When I was in elementary school, my classmates lent me a lot of books. During the summer vacation, I was obsessed with the adventure stories of Doraemon and Nobita. There are many weird props and many weird stories, which are really interesting. It’s a relaxed reading. Sometimes there is sadness and sorrow. In many places, there are some advices to protect cultural relics and extinct animals. Sometimes I read it and think about it quietly, which is very thought-provoking. In short, this is one of my favorite comics, which left me precious and pure memories. 
0	I don't know why the speakers always reverberate. If they get closer, they reverberate, which is very harsh. It's just a small problem. 
0	Stayed more than a month ago. Very impressed. The exterior of the hotel looks very good. The inside is pretty average. What impressed me was that my butt started to itch on the second day. It made me go to see the doctor. Fortunately. No problem. Maybe the quilt was not cleaned. There are bacteria on it. It must not be disinfected. It is impossible to change the quilt. I suggest that you stay more expensive in the future. Don’t be greedy for cheap. It’s only one or two hundred fast Things. As we went to Dongguan to live in Haiyue later, it was very good. More than 500 nights. The rooms are big. Very new. The environment is also very good. The attitude of the waiters is also very good. In short, everything is very good. Very satisfied. Very good value. I believe Haiyue in Shenzhen will not be bad. I dare not live with 3 stars and 4 stars now. Hey, don't worry. 
1	Admire it! ! It’s been a long time since I saw such a wonderful book. In the past few years, I have been disinterested in the love between high school students. Began to have a strong interest in traversing texts, ancient texts. Before buying, look at everyone's comments, and it has been well received by everyone. After waiting for several days, I read the first book after receiving the goods. The love between the two is indeed qualified to be a good story. It's very touching, the story is closely linked, one after another. It's really exciting. Like it's dead. 
1	When I was in school, I had some rebellious psychology. The more people said, the less lazy to read it. In fact, rebelliousness cannot be regarded as my adolescent psychology, but I do see that many so-called masterpieces cannot be read at all. How did others read it? Later, I completely bypassed these so-called masterpieces and looked at it entirely based on my own interests; but as I grew older, I gradually discovered that in most cases, these recommended things are reasonable, so I am approaching the age of confidence. I began to slowly read these books that everyone has praised. 
0	Add: You should also bring your own shampoo. If you think that dish soap can also shampoo your hair, it doesn't matter! 
0	Very interesting hotel, the facilities and everything are okay, but I was still sleeping in the morning, and someone came in with the key and opened the door. It scared me and reduced my points a lot... 
1	The hotel environment, the rooms are very good, and the service level is professional. Stayed for two days, I feel really good, the self-service barbecue on the second floor makes people feel at home 
1	"The popular American drama ""CSI Crime Scene"", and similar dramas, such as Hong Kong's ""Forensic Verification Record"", melts precision medicine into the tortuous and bizarre plot, allowing inanimate corpses and exhibits to speak, which is always not enough. nervous feeling. And this book, too. The female forensic doctor Scarpetta is looking for evidence among the bones, but she is in danger. Such Li Changyu-like characters always make people reverence: wise, rational, and she is beautiful, giving the framework of the cold suspense novel. Blowing in a breeze, it is inevitable to be hooked in summer. "
1	The hotel was just renovated in 2008, the interior has a strong smell of decoration and building materials, and the windows cannot be opened. In addition, the hotel was renamed as Renmin after being renovated, so most taxi drivers don’t know the location of the hotel. 
1	"""Zhao Bo's books are no longer published by mainstream publishing houses, and the author's decline can be seen."" To correct this statement, Zhao Bo will have no new works after 2004. (Don't dare to guess the author's recent years Life), even books published before 2004 have one book and two publications, and the number is full. Qiufengqiuyu is really worried about killing. "
0	This book is not for me, the whole book is not funny, and it doesn’t help memorize words at all, I still can’t remember 
1	"I have stayed in a lot of hotels, but I have never commented on it. This time I have a sea view and I feel so touched that I must talk about it. The high-quality services evaluated by all the guests above will not be repeated, because these are in line with the ""five-star standard"", but the service of the sea view does start from the needs of the guests and think about it. Let’s talk about an example. This time, I was unlucky enough to suffer from acute gastroenteritis in Qingdao. I had to go to the hospital to hang water early in the morning. The hotel sent someone to accompany me. The little girl carried a very heavy bag. At first we didn't know what it was. Later, when we went to the hospital, we learned that it contained a thermos, quilt, towel and fruit. After arranging the water before and after the run, the doctor said that we could eat some fruit, but found that the bananas and oranges we brought were not good, so I immediately ran outside to buy a bag of apples and blanched them with boiling water. Because we heard that she was actually off work, we tried our best to let her go back to rest, but she insisted on refusing. During the process of more than 2 hours, she always sat across from me with a smile to see what I needed. When I saw my arm was cold Went to iron the towel and put it on me, poured water and took things without stopping. Later, we finally knew why she refused to leave because she had to wait until the order was over and asked the hotel to send a car to pick her up. Within 5 minutes of returning to the hotel, the porridge was delivered to the room-these are services we did not request. When I left the store and waited for the shuttle bus, I shrank on the sofa with a fever, and someone immediately brought a blanket. After asking about the situation, a hot ginger soup was delivered after a while, and then we found that the empty space above my head was quietly turned off. ..... Too many details are a bit verbose, but I am really moved. A friend said that maybe it is because of the Olympics to establish an image, but I don't think it is. Many things can be regulated and can be trained, but the sense of service cannot be achieved overnight. Going to Qingdao again, Seaview Garden is my only choice! Supplement: We want to give the waiter 200 yuan, because tipping is normal, not to mention that people are so hard before and after running, but she is determined not to! "
1	No hair accessory is practical. That's a hair style that one person can handle. This book must be done for you by professionals. The shape inside is super beautiful, but many wig bags and wig pieces are used, which shows the high difficulty. Can only refer to it. That kind of messy hair style is actually much more difficult than neatly combing. And this book uses a lot of gorgeous and exaggerated hair accessories, which are not suitable for general occasions. Personal opinions for reference to MM who want to buy. If you want to collect and appreciate it, that's fine. If you want to do it yourself according to the booklet, I recommend a hair accessory expert 
1	The appearance is simple and generous, and it will not be annoying after a long time. HP models are all good. The price/performance ratio is also high. 
1	It looks beautiful and easy to use. Vista is not as bad as others said, and the D drive has a driver. 
0	The biggest drawback is that there is no phonetic transcription, which is not very convenient to read, and the content of the book is not funny at all, or the author has a limited sense of humor. . . 
0	The decoration of the room is relatively old, and there is no leisure shopping place nearby, and the price/performance ratio is not high. Although it is said that the Internet is provided for free, it is actually not available. Finally, you have to live in a computer room to access the Internet, which is not suitable for business travel. One more complaint. Some of the bathroom utensils, including shower gel and shampoo, are full, some are only half a bottle, and may be left over from the last time. Please pay attention when you check in. 
0	It seems that my child will not like this book for the time being! There is too much information, and children don't like densely packed small print! 
1	When I opened this book, I was immersed in the memories, bit by bit when I was young, and sometimes after reading an article, I lay in bed and thought quietly, remembering quietly, crying silently, and silently. Smile. But everything will never come back. I just feel that the sun was brighter than it is now, and the grass was greener than it is now. Everything is over. . . . . . I can only bring these memories into my grave. I think some chapters in the book are contrived, but I think the main success of this book is to evoke our memories, so the others do not matter. 
0	The touchpad is too small to use, the 6-cell battery is too large and heavy, and the notebook can’t be placed flat (so I plan to buy a 3-cell battery), the mirror screen is reflective, vista is not a business version, and there is no gift. Zhongtong Express is too low It's too slow, it is recommended not to save postage. 
0	Like the title, I haven’t read the book yet. Generally speaking, the printing effect is okay. However, the whole set of books has an unpleasant smell. I don’t know what the publisher considers. This set of books is for children to read. Such a big taste may cause some irritation to the children's respiratory tract. I wonder why this book can get so many five-star reviews? ! 
0	I booked 2 single rooms through Ctrip. When I arrived at the hotel, the front desk told me that I had booked 1 single room and 1 standard room. After strong negotiations, the hotel still gave me 2 single rooms, but the facilities inside were extremely poor. The door has a strong smell of smoke and smell, the TV remote control board is broken, the quilt in the room is super thin, and the air conditioner has to be turned on to the maximum. The cabinet was full of pillows but there was no quilt, the water in the bathroom was not smooth, and the floor was covered with water after a bath... The only thing worth mentioning was that it was good early. The summary is as follows: 1. There is a problem with the room reservation. Ctrip has booked 2 single rooms with me, but when I arrive at the hotel, it becomes 1 single room and 1 standard room; 2. The condition of the hotel is too poor and does not meet the three-star standard at all, so it is not recommended to stay 
0	This price is not as good as Jinjiang Inn. The room is relatively old. The soundproofing is not good, you can hear the voice of the waiter's walkie-talkie, and it makes loud noises when someone closes and opens the door. Hot water comes out slowly and the air conditioner is not cold. Not coming next time 
1	Stayed for three days and felt that the service was ok, and the buffet at night was not bad. 
1	After finally watching Du Lala 2, I feel that there is a kind of foxtail sable. The theory inside is too esoteric for newcomers who have just entered the workplace. Broadband salary, evaluation system, etc. are all HR content. The question really shouldn't be called Du Lala's promotion. Can be replaced by HR method encyclopedia? There are more and more characters, more and more irrelevant. The final ending is more difficult for people to understand, stop writing Du Lala three, this is how the masterpiece writes continuations and continuations. It's like the Pearl Gege series 
0	The transportation is convenient. There are buses 34 and 9 to the Yellow River at the door, and bus 1 to the city center. The hotel room facilities were outdated. After I entered the door and inserted the key card to get the electricity, I discovered that the kettle was empty. Later, I learned that the kettle was faulty and would not automatically cut off the power. I told the waiter who delivered the breakfast about it, but there was no response. The headrest cushion is torn. Possibly due to the water quality, the washbasin, bathtub, and toilet have many marks, they look very dirty, and the carpet is not clean. Breakfast is delivered to the room at the time requested by the guest (7:00-9:00). There are too many to eat, and the quality is average. It seems to be the things sold at the market stall next to the train station. The room deposit is paid day by day. It should be noted that the waiter will ask you if you want an invoice during the checkout, and the invoice will automatically add 2 yuan a day to the original price without any prior explanation. 
0	"1. The panel around the monitor, the four corners, the frame under the camera and near the EEEPC logo, look at it diagonally under strong light, and you can see that there are cracks. 2. Under windows startup music, you can hear a ""crack"" sound from the left speaker. I can’t hear it when playing music normally. "
0	The memory is a bit small, but it can be added. It’s a bit troublesome to install the system, and the invoices you issue can’t be found online, which is a bit strange. I don’t know if the invoice will be recognized after sale 
1	This set of books is really good. It's like telling a child's story. Bit by bit reveals the author's sadness. After reading it, he feels very relaxed. Whenever he reads these books, he will be attracted by the content of the book. Laughing also made him change from a naughty child to a child who loves to read. From the living room to the study, to the toilet, to the school, he always loves it. Taking it to school has become a popular book for students to borrow from each other. I am also very grateful for the teacher's recommendation, so that the child can find a happy answer in the intense study life.

0	This is definitely a black-hearted shop, which fully shows the ugly characteristics of Henan people. A bed sheet was dyed a little red by my faded underwear. It turns out that it can be washed off, but they (she) charged me 40 yuan Money. In fact, bed sheets are only worth 10 yuan. I didn't want to issue an invoice at the beginning. I asked them for taxation before giving up. Friends, don't live.

0	Lanzhou...a city that I don’t want to come again. I stayed at Jinlun Hotel on the first day. I was not satisfied with it. Once again, I asked Ctrip to have a better one, which is also a four-star hotel. Called the best in Lanzhou and China, the worst four-star is none other than him...Check in at 10pm and go upstairs after the procedures are completed...Oh my God...no lights...I turned on the lights after touching for a long time, Because it was too late and I was a little tired, I thought of entering the house to rest. What I didn't expect was that the door card could not open the door. After tossing for a long time, I finally opened the door with the waiter's card. The parking lot is open, and the fee is still there. In other words, please check into the hotel you recommend personally, the president of Ctrip, or two words: shame 
1	The appearance is beautiful and generous, the configuration is even, and it is not bad for ordinary household use! The screen feels brighter than dell. The camera QQ chat is enough. The price/performance ratio is also ok. 
0	1. Delivery time is too long! 2. Value-added tax invoices are not sent randomly. 3. It is very troublesome to install XP. If there is a mass purchase, I don't know whether the system can be installed, but this violates the original intention of not opening the box or opening the package. 4. The price is 70 higher than the local inquiry, and a package rat is also given. 
1	It should be said that this set of sticker books is very good, or it is the best one of the sticker books I have ever bought. The first is that there are a lot of stickers, there are three pages, so that children will not be able to put them all at once; the second is that the quality of the stickers is also good, and the daughter can basically tear it off by herself without tearing; In the process, you can not only exercise your hand dexterity, but also learn some other knowledge, such as identifying objects, classifying, counting, and identifying colors. But for a daughter who is a little over two years old, there may be something simple. Personally think it is more suitable for children aged one and a half to two years old. 
1	Teacher Jin's book really gives you the comfort of chicken soup for the soul. It is not just chicken soup, but it is a perfect soup. Let go of all the unevenness and restlessness in your heart, and calm down to read through.

0	Although I thought it would be ugly before I bought the book, I didn’t expect that David’s image severely impacted my ability to accept the book after I received the book. It’s really ugly, and the image resembles graffiti, if not before I bought the book After reading the text description, many images can't understand what it means. I don't like it. I don't know if my two and a half year old son can accept it. The little guy has his own aesthetic point of view, memorizing the three-character scriptures in sets, look at his opinions at night, he likes is the most important thing. If he likes it, he will definitely come up tomorrow to comment again. 
1	I bought this book after giving birth. I think it’s too late to meet each other! My body was relatively poor before pregnancy, and it was also treated by an old Chinese doctor to get pregnant and give birth to the baby. Knowing that there is this book, you can buy it and follow the method in the book to do early conditioning, so that your physical condition will be better, and your current physical condition will not be worse than before pregnancy! This is indeed a very valuable book, and the method in it is very feasible. It is recommended to prepare for parents to buy it for common reference. 
0	Pros: Close to the commercial center, not far from the train station, the price is fair. Disadvantages: the room equipment is poor, almost the standard of a guest house, the surrounding environment is dirty and poor, and the noise is loud. The smell of barbecue is pungent.

1	On July 25th, I went to visit Taishan with my family and booked a room in the Overseas Chinese Building through Ctrip. (Said it was an event and spent 280 to upgrade to the 360 ​​room, but we don’t actually know what the 280 and 360 rooms are like). The evaluation of Huaqiao Building is the same as that of many netizens in the past: the service is very enthusiastic, but the facilities are too outdated. Whether the room booked is newly decorated, I hope that Ctrip will do its work carefully in the future). When staying in the Overseas Chinese Building, the concierge and the room service staff at the front desk are very nice and enthusiastic. They respond quickly to the guests' requests (I asked for an extra set of toiletries to the room because I brought my children, but it didn’t take long after I put down the phone It was delivered), and patiently answered some questions we asked about how to go to Mount Tai, what's delicious nearby. The room has a welcome fruit plate, and the portion is not small, very real, ha ha. However, the facilities in the Overseas Chinese Building are indeed too old. The wallpaper in many places has fallen off. The bathroom in the room is relatively small and there is no separate shower room. It feels inconvenient for the elderly and children to use it. But good service can make up for these shortcomings, and the price is not expensive, I feel acceptable. 
0	The touchpad is not available. The keyboard is good and sometimes bad, and the heat dissipation effect is not good. The most important thing is that Jingdong Mall does not handle returns according to law. 
0	At first glance, I think that many aspects are good, but after carefully doing it, I feel that some things are also made by the author, and they are rarely translated. 
1	"Hong Kong-style language. It's really hard to understand. But I still understand it. But I prefer Lin Xi's ""Once"". More literary "
0	I agree with the reviews of the first two too much. I regret that I was too busy to read the reviews at the time. Except that there is no way to suggest that you check other hotels. 
1	"First of all, this set of books is a large format, and the paper and printing are very good. My baby is 3 years old and likes this set of heart-warming picture books. In this series, her favorites are ""Grandpa Henry Looking for Lucky"", ""Who Is Outside the Door"", especially ""Grandpa Henry Looking for Lucky"", she always finds it every night when she is reading Come out, and then lean against me and listen to me with relish, perhaps because the language in the book is very warm and beautiful. She is also very concerned about when the third series will be published. "
0	According to common sense, Ganzhou Hotel should be the best hotel in Ganzhou, but I was wrong! It is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in 
1	1. The environment is good, very close to Dongbai, just behind Dongjiekou. 2. The rooms are nice, with computers and free internet access. 
0	"I bought it after reading five stars, and I was disappointed. There are some languages in the book that are not suitable for children. Children can easily imitate them like ""get away"". I suggest that you take good care of it before you decide. My personal opinion is not good. "
1	As the title, this is the biggest harvest I have read this book. I think that the people who have been entangled with me for life after life have already appeared, or that I hope the people who have been entangled with me for life after life have appeared-my parents, my husband, my daughter, and mine. Dear friend. This book is still a bit procrastinating, and the central idea expressed in the latter part is actually explained in the previous part. If you want to have more insights about life, life and death, you can't just read this book. 
1	The location of Yangtze Island Hotel is very good. It is very convenient for shopping, shopping, eating and entertainment. The hotel is opposite to Metropolis and Pacific Mall, and behind it is Meimei Department Store. The decoration of the hotel is also very good, clean and tidy. Most importantly, the price is relatively cheap. In short, as a four-star hotel, Yangtze Island is very good in terms of service and environment, and even feels better than some five-star hotels. However, we have not tried Yangtze Island’s own fitness center and recreational facilities, so we will not comment. 
1	Average facilities are good, other average breakfast is also good 
0	It would be nice if the memory is a single memory, and it will be easier to upgrade in the future, but 2G is enough for the time being, and there is no upgrade plan at present 
0	Originally lived in Mo Tai well, but when I saw this hotel on the Internet, I changed it, and I regret it. The hotel lacks a sense of service. When I entered the door, the doorman was leaning at the door and would not say hello to the guests. The waiter in the hotel was also very indifferent, which made me a little uncomfortable. There was a network cable in the room, but I called to get it. The network cable gave me a very short one, and told me to let me use it, and the network cable was still intermittent. Call the waiter, and he would be able to fiddle with it. When I got up in the morning, it was broken again, so I just stayed. Moved away in one day. The room should be clean, but it is far from the commercial area and the square downstairs is noisy. In short, because of service issues, I don’t recommend this shop. It’s really better to go to the Mo Tai near Qiulin 
0	"There is an elevated street in front of me, it was too noisy, I didn't sleep all night! Hotel feedback July 7, 2008: Hello! First of all, I apologize that you didn’t rest overnight. The Beihong Road store is adjacent to the Central Ring Road. The Central Ring Road is in front of you. There will be more cars during the day, but there will be very few cars in the Central Ring Road after 20. The room effect is still ok, as long as the window is closed, there is basically no loud sound. And most of the guests staying in our Beihong store are business guests, and the room types are also different. Most guests like the front facing Central Room, because this type of room has better lighting and good air circulation! But we also have very quiet rooms facing the community. For guests with various needs, we will arrange for you to stay in a room in the Chao community next time you stay. I hope you will give us this opportunity again! Let you feel the breath of ""home"" at home! ! "
0	I haven't received the goods! ! ! ! ! ! ! No one answered the phone call! ! Never encountered such a thing! ! ! ! I want to consult the post office goods invoice number, but I can’t find it! what happened? It's also the world's largest book shopping network, not to be trusted! ! 
0	Easy to stick to dust. The system is very difficult to install. Now the popular system disk with backup cannot directly enter the boot installation. After all, not everyone is familiar with this situation. 
0	Because it is a well-reviewed book! I bought it! The baby is two years old and three months old, and he usually likes to read books, but this set of books is not touchable! It may be too small! This set of books is not suitable for small children Look!. 
0	I don’t know how to use the system called lu. I want to change to XP. I heard that it’s a bit troublesome. I don’t know if there is any expert under the guidance of the younger brother. 
0	Very disappointed, the content of the book is messy and meaningless. The whole psychiatric hospital looks like a mental clinic. My brain is blank after seeing it, and my mood is not light at all. For friends who want to read and have fun, this book is definitely not the best choice. 
1	Everyone has experienced or is experiencing childhood. There are always many people who think that childhood is beautiful. How many years have passed will be missed. Always hear people say that if they can go back to childhood, how good they would be to grow up, how many people have a little bit of childhood Didu’s memory is still fresh, at least for me, I can’t remember it for a long time. That’s why I chose this book. I like to remember but gradually forgot the little bit of childhood due to poor memory. This book helped me find that feeling. It’s very plain, just like your own life. There is no great joy and compassion, but I am moved everywhere. This book makes me respect its author 
1	Simple but not simple, I like the style very much. Catch up with the special price, use the coupon, feel worth it. The order is placed in less than 24 hours, very fast. 
0	I booked it for my parents~ I said that the room is far from the Shenghua, and the breakfast is not good. The only good thing is that it is in the scenic area~ 
0	"Haha~ This hotel is so funny. We came here all the way from Beijing and only found out when we stayed, this whole nursing home for veterans! There are old cadres wearing suits and ties with big bellies everywhere, and there are usually beautiful women to accompany them! Hey~FB! The room is more interesting, it may be designed for the veteran cadres with a green carpet! Just one word ""big"", big ones are empty! ! ! But the facilities are complete! But for this price, it's not worth living in this place! ! ! The front desk service attitude is very bad. It may be our young couple. I knew at a glance that they were here to play. I don’t know if I lived in the wrong place. I didn’t care about it. I was really depressed. It’s amazing to be an old cadre! Our couple live in the store with our own pockets, not public money! ! ! But the restaurants around the hotel give full marks! In addition to seeing that we can't speak Cantonese and bullying us, it's okay. You know, Beijingers are the most enthusiastic and polite, and they will never treat diners like this! Here, I would like to remind friends from the north who are going to Guangzhou to learn Cantonese, otherwise they will only be angry! I was so angry that I wanted to communicate with them in English! ! ! "
1	Business big bed room, the room is very big, the bed is 2M wide, the overall feeling is economical and affordable! 
0	It was in my hands yesterday, and today I found that the price was reduced by 100 when I surfed the Internet. This is really unbalanced. . There are only simple instructions on the warranty and other instructions in the package. There are no other instructions for use. I have to find out about the FN button. 
1	The price is affordable, the configuration is OK, and the VISTA SP2 scores 3.2! The heat dissipation is better than expected! Always 45-49! No games 
1	Yes, the notebooks are ultra-thin and easy to carry. I originally wanted to buy a black one. After I received the goods, I found that the color was pretty good, not too bright, and I also sent the original liner bag. 
1	When I first read the introduction, I thought such a novel was very good. After all, there are too few short suspense novels now. The producer and editor of the novel are also very fond of myself, and I have always felt that short stories are not as long as long stories. Waiting time, and the facts have proved this. There are several works in the novel that are really good and attractive. They are not suspenseful, shocking and weird at all, but some of the works are average, so it caused me. The good-looking ones are very beautiful, and I don’t even bother to read a word that is not good-looking. I hope that future fan novels will gradually get better 
1	The price is okay, I won it by 6768 (using a 500 to 20 coupon), the next day it rose back to 6999. The authentic Targus bag is very beautiful and solid. 
0	The room facilities are outdated, the smell is too strong, and there are yellow spots on the sheets.

0	Lived for a day, it was like a nightmare! Nothing satisfies me! ! 
1	"""Although it is an encyclopedia, it is very easy to read. Why is that? Because this set of books concentrates similar knowledge content into one knowledge category, and each knowledge category is divided into different knowledge topics. A comprehensive introduction to the knowledge points and pictures of this topic, as well as the legends to help understand the painting, looks very much like a ""knowledge tree"". ""The words of ""confidant sister"" Lu Qin are indeed very precise. Children in the second grade, read them again and again, and sometimes test us with some of the common questions. Apart from studying, the family enjoys it. value! "
0	There is no table in the hotel room. The first time I encountered it, there were spiders. The room equipment was relatively old. 
1	The appearance is quite beautiful and generous, and the price is very reasonable. DDR3 memory leads many desktops. 
1	"Reading the book ""Strongs grow by an inch and live for ten years"" made my eyes bright. For a confident person, I have a great influence. Although I love fitness exercises, I also like health care books. The book is a good book with strong operability. It is very applicable in daily life, especially the method of stretching is easy to learn. Unfortunately, it lacks the essentials of osteopathy knowledge. I hope the author of this book will add it in future publications. perfect. I will promote the knowledge I have learned to my relatives and friends. As long as I exercise for a long time, I will be rewarded. "
0	"I forgot to mention that the front desk service was poor. After lunch at Motel’s self-operated ""Merrill Little Chef"" lunch, there was a pack box. I wanted to temporarily send the front desk out to buy a pack of cigarettes. The guy at the front desk said not to store food. I went back to the hotel and turned over all ""Customer Instructions"" without this item. Instead, I asked customers to send valuables to the front desk. Is the packaged abalone counted as an item? "
0	I bought it when I saw that the evaluation was so high, but my daughter didn't like it. I looked at it and didn't like it either. I don't know what it is. The cars are all outdated or not in life. I don't understand why there is such a high evaluation. 
1	"The story is simple and easy to understand, so the child finishes all the books quickly. She also took a few books to the school and lent them to her classmates to read them together, saying that they also liked them. However, it is a pity that a copy of ""Tom's Little Sister"" she brought was not found. I don't know which classmate took it away, and no one admits it! It's annoying, I'm a book-conscious person. Therefore, in the future, children are required to take the books to school carefully. I don't want to always borrow my beloved book, but I don't know who did it! I like it, so if I have a chance in the future, I will repurchase the lost one. "
1	The waiters here are very good, and the problems raised to them during the previous stay can be corrected in time, and praise. 
1	"Since I read Mickey’s series, I do have further thoughts about life. I really should thank him for giving me such a chance~ This book talks about an old professor who is about to die and his former student The stories of the last fourteen lessons taught in each lesson are touching philosophies. I don’t know whether it is appropriate to use a common saying here: ""A person is about to die, and his words are good."" In fact, for the old professor , The words are the experience of love in life~ it is that we really asked ourselves~ "
0	The layout is too small! It’s not very good. It’s great if it’s a big version, it won’t be obvious, and the characters can be bigger, isn’t it great? The child doesn't like it very much now. 
0	I feel disappointed. It is not as good as I imagined. The method taught in the book is not specific at all. It gives people a general feeling. I only feel that I am listening to others blowing water and not my own business. Generally speaking, it is not practical! 
0	No CD-ROM drive, the volume is 13 inches. The screen appears small. The system is not good and the partition is unreasonable. 1g memory is too small. Do not send the mouse. I don't know what to think, can I lose money by sending a mouse. The price is slightly more expensive, integrated graphics, can not play games, no built-in cat 
0	The operating system is too mentally installed! It is actually divided into 2 areas, one is the ASUS tool area, and the remaining capacity is divided into one large area to install winxp! Which of the computers you can use is not a separate data area; not to mention that the system only needs 20G. I had to re-partition and install the system if I got it, it was very popular! 
1	Colleagues all started to read and practiced on their children. The effect is obvious. It's a great book! 
1	For unknown reasons, the current price of this hotel has been lowered, and there are actually promotional prices on weekends. Not bad! This time I stayed in a double room, with a tight layout and comfortable bed. Overall, it was still very good! 
1	Qingdao is an agreement on a Shangri-La. If you don’t have a room, you can live in this hotel. It feels okay. But there is still room for improvement 
0	When I read his rich noodles, I felt that it was a book that gave me hope, but when I looked at it, I thought the opposite. It didn’t help much. It was just a failure 
0	The amount of memory configuration is low. The memory slot is under the palm rest and needs to be disassembled and installed, which is not convenient. The Bluetooth module is controlled by software. 
1	It can be said that this is really a book from a long time ago. I remember that I accidentally downloaded the electronic version. After reading it, it feels very sad. It is the first time I feel this way after reading a novel. Broken, simple characters, simple storyline, but completely unable to accept Xia Piaoxue's departure. Perhaps because this is not just a simple romance novel, Luo Xin learned to grow up in Piaoxue, but I want to say is it really so painful to grow up, then can we choose not to grow up a good book? , Although the printing is not very good, but it will make you look once and touch 
0	It’s the first time to buy a book in Dangdang. I feel regretful. It’s not as good as it is. The delivery speed is too slow. I haven’t arrived yet. I hope I feel better after seeing the book. 
0	For this book, it is really well written! But how do you say Dangdang is an exclusive launch, there are many free online! I don’t know if I’m too stupid or a copyright issue! 
1	A good resort hotel with a first-class environment, especially the outdoor natural environment is very good, and the room facilities are also good. The only downside is that the price of the restaurant in the hotel is a bit higher, which is almost the same as the price in a 4-star hotel in Hong Kong The hot springs are average, worse than those in Tangshan, Nanjing. 
1	The hotel is very close to the sea, and you can see the sea from the room on the 4th floor. But it is too far from the railway station and the coach station, and the traffic is not very convenient. I asked the waiter if I needed to book a taxi for check-out around 6am the day before. The waiter said that there was no need to book a taxi at any time, but the next morning, I waited for a long time at the hotel entrance in the cold wind before I got the taxi. 
1	She looks pretty, my girlfriend likes it very much, and she performs very well. Very cost-effective. Now the notebook is really the price of cabbage. . . 
1	"I read the summary of Huntington's ""Clash of Civilizations"" in ""Reference News"", and I read it for the first time in the officially published book, and I haven't finished it yet. He is really a great contemporary political scientist. First, he systematically and scientifically summarized the relationship between the development history of world civilization and political conflicts. Second, within a few years of the end of the Cold War (1993), he foresaw the change from ideology to world conflicts. Clash of civilizations changes, such a highly sensitive political thinking, how many people are there today? The third is foreseeing that the United States will be attacked from Islamic countries (the ""911"" incident occurred). great! ! "
0	The facilities of this hotel are outdated, it is not a star hotel, it can only be regarded as a guest house. The room is small and the floor is shaking when walking. In short, my impression of staying here is average. Will not consider it again next time! 
1	All aspects are general, as long as the expectations are not too high. 
1	I stayed in a business suite. Although it was not as big as the 72 square meters written on the co-process, the layout and decoration of 52 square meters were very satisfactory. There are also free soft drinks and free laundry (within a certain amount) in the suite, so it is still good value for money. Although the place is not close to the sea, I can see the sea on the 32nd floor, and it is not far from Yunxiao Road, Qingdao's most famous food street, so although it is not as casual as a seaside resort, the location is quite good. 
1	"I have been wondering whether there is a gunman writing for the bandit, and why the book is published so fast, so that my purse has been sacrificed so tragically. The last book I read about the bandit was ""Flowers on the Sea"", ""Thousand Mountains"" and ""Prosperity"" The direction of the story is somewhat similar, but there are more conspiracy and betrayal in the content; Lei Yuzheng and Mo Shaoqian also have the same persistence and stubbornness, but Lei is more straightforward, and Mo is more forbearing and deep ~ Towards the end, all suspense is like an onion The three words in the text message in the finale not only touched Tong Xue, but also touched everyone's hearts. . . "
0	After refitting the XP system, there are some problems with Bluetooth. But I connected an external device to use. Basically does not affect the use 
0	It's really too bad to say, but there is a lot of it. When I checked in, I found that there were no bath towels, but the next day we kept calling and saying that we had taken the two bath towels. As a result, the 6 of us had been waiting for the so-called manager to appear and solve the two bath towels. The environment is still very poor, the room I live in is small and dark. Don't be fooled by its outside world 
1	As soon as I got the book, I couldn't wait to read it. It is indeed a book worth reading. I admire the author’s direct writing. Some of her ideas are bold but are indeed beneficial to children, such as her views on “punishmental” homework. How many dare to challenge the dignity of teachers? But out of love for his daughter, the author bravely insisted on his position. There are many and many guidance on the issue of educating children, but it is really valuable to stick to your own principles. This book is completely refreshing and highly recommended! 
0	I really don't feel much about this book. What the author said is very abstract, I feel quite empty and meaningless. A little regret buying this book. 
1	1. Beautiful appearance, stable performance, good heat dissipation, gold-letter sign with thinkpad 2. Because of low performance requirements, so choose a single-core book, personal use is enough, 3799 starting, high cost performance 3. Thinkpad's Guangzhou city The service at the after-sales point of East Road is good, because the screws of the memory cover are too difficult to unscrew, go to the after-sales place to install them, the maintenance staff are very enthusiastic and feel good 
0	This Home Inn is really bad. I booked two rooms, one without windows, and a so-called business double room. As a result, it couldn't be smaller. I hope you must take a good look at the evaluations of the people we have stayed before. I really think it is very bad. I also moved in because I called to book and didn’t see the evaluations of friends who had stayed before. It was already 10 o’clock when I checked in Too much, but it took 20 minutes to check in. I barely stayed for one day and checked out early the next morning. Suggest that you don't live. 
1	The name of the protagonist in the book is Louis. He is a trumpeter swan who was born unable to speak. He couldn't talk to the same kind, so he learned to write. Later, he learned that writing can only talk to humans. His father was worried, so he went to the store. After a trumpet, Louis began to learn the trumpet, so that in the end he could play the songs of many famous musicians. Louis paid off the trumpet money of the shop owner with the money he earned from playing the trumpet. . . . . . . . As soon as I opened the book, I was deeply attracted by the contents and almost forgot to eat. . . . . . . . . 
1	When I lent it to a friend, I asked her if she wanted to cry when she saw it, and she said yes. I feel the same way. Why can't it be said? It just feels that Cheng Ran's depiction is very delicate and realistic. I learned about Zen only after reading this book, because I was very confused and needed the comfort of this type of book. It seems that after waiting for a long time on Dangdang, it is finally out of stock and finally bought. Holding it in my hand, moved and sad. But this book is really suitable for us to read. In this chaotic world, to have this book as a companion, thank you Cheng Ran! 
0	I placed an order on January 7 and I received the goods yesterday, but I found that there is no one? The Beauty Sutra of a 31-year-old Little Beauty?. I didn't say it was out of stock, somehow? 
1	"""This book will let you quit smoking"" is indeed the case. Although I have not finished reading this book, although I am still smoking, I am still convinced of this. I just read half of this book. The author has conducted an in-depth analysis of smokers’ hearts based on his own smoking experience and diagnostic cases. It truly reflects the inner world of smokers. It is very vivid and true. He told us: smoking is not Gives us what we want, and quitting smoking is not as terrible as we imagined. It is so difficult. It gives me confidence and courage. I hope that the majority of smokers can quit smoking successfully under the inspiration of this book! ! ! ! "
0	1. The battery is only 3 cores. 2. There is no CD-ROM drive, it is troublesome to install the system, and it does not support USB-ZIP. It can only be started in USB-HDD mode, which took me a lot of time. 3. The price is still quite expensive 
0	"The content of the book, nothing to say, is very good, but the quality of the paper packaging and cutting of the book is too poor! ! ! ! The paper and packaging of the book I bought from Dangdang before are pretty good. The two copies of ""Seeking a Doctor is worse than Seeking Yourself"" I received this time have very rough edges, rough paper, and uneven cutting. Because of this problem, the return is not good, but I feel very uncomfortable when I read it in my hand! Hope that the quality will be strictly controlled in the future! ! ! "
1	People in the 80s are people who have grown up with the reform and opening up. It should be said that they are also the best generation to witness these 30 years. But in this generation, for the madness of the 80s and the frivolousness of the early 90s, I don't have much impression, but this book gives people like ours a clear understanding of the vague 80s, and their own understanding of the 90s that they couldn't understand at that time. Thanks to the author for providing us with such an opportunity to understand this period of history, and for letting us see the persistent pursuit of that generation more truly. 
1	The overall feeling of the room is ok except that the decoration is not trendy enough. I live in a double bed room. It would be better if the bathroom in the room could be made of glass. The location of the hotel is excellent. We took a bus from Guangzhou to Chang'an. After we got off the bus, we passed the road to Chang'an Hotel, which was super convenient. There are restaurants and Baijia supermarkets around the hotel. I especially recommend everyone to try Minghongchuan cuisine. When I was living in Chang'an eleven years ago, there was a Minghongchuan restaurant, and it was still there after 11 years! And the taste is still so good, and the dishes are much more refined than before, haha... What Ctrip needs to improve is to negotiate with the hotel. Every room should be given a double breakfast. One breakfast causes a lot of inconvenience to guests. . To be honest, the two of them stayed in the hotel. If they didn’t eat breakfast, they felt wasted. Let’s eat. Another breakfast cost more than 50 yuan. It is not that the price is expensive, but the quality of the breakfast is not worth the money, ha ha... … 
1	Good value for money, same price, good Samsung hotel... 
1	The goods have been received. It is an original machine. It feels pretty good. Toshiba's workmanship is simply first-class. The design is very user-friendly and the heat emitted is very low. The mold is very beautiful. 
1	At first I bought the Enneagram and saw that everyone recommended this book, and I bought it with curiosity! This book is a novel in the form of a spiritual practice, and from the beginning of the story, it shows the fragile side of people's hearts to readers. We are all thinking about some of our own performances and then from the protagonist’s life, work, feelings and other aspects in the novel to let the readers know it. Well, after reading it, I went to mention some books in the book. I bought it and I am reading it now. When I close the book, it is very memorable. It is indeed a gain that is not easy to describe. I recommend everyone to take a look. It is more suitable for female friends! ^_^ 
1	The reception service at the front desk was too poor, and I ignored it when I went to the front desk to check in. I lived in 3 buildings, and it was difficult to find a house without the front desk. There was no waiter to bring it there, but the room and environment were ok ,L! ! 
1	A very cost-effective one~ and I am also the one I am most satisfied with. Convenient at the door, a fruit shop, 5 minutes walk from Jiuguang Department Store, 5 minutes walk from Jing'an Temple on Line 2. The hotel service is in place! Praise~ The room is good Convenience, sufficient taste, sufficient quantity, and affordable prices~ I will always choose here in the future. Ha ha, please remember to book early! 
1	"I have been looking forward to the release of this set of books. When I got the book, I felt a little bit regretful, but I couldn’t tell. But when I read every story, I was deeply touched. The author's pictures and stories are attracted. The animals are so cute in his writing, which is definitely a miniature of society. Now I tell my baby every day, he keeps listening ""Ah! Oh!"" He is also amazed at the bizarre and interesting story. In short, be sure to read it carefully. You will totally fall in love with it. "
0	The author's writing is okay, but the whole article feels too trivial, a bit of a literati moan. Liberals. The author’s character disagrees with, no national standpoint (it can be called a traitor), and romantic 
1	The room is spacious and clean. There is a small LCD TV on the wall. The bathroom does not have a bathtub and can only shower, but it is not a problem. Changning Road is a big road, but because the hotel is located in an alley, the environment is relatively quiet. I prefer Jin Jiang chef, cheap and delicious, and the service attitude is okay. The price of 229 yuan is indeed very competitive. There is a problem with the network speed, and there are often interruptions or connection failures. 
0	It seems to be very hot after using it for a while. There is a problem with the driver of the wireless network card on the built-in driver disk, and the installation always fails! ~ After calling the customer service, they said to reinstall the system. There was no way. I had to download a driver wizard and it was done. In addition, it is better if it is an XP system. 
0	I just turned a few pages and found that it was not authentic English or American. After all, it was written by Koreans. It's ridiculous to think about myself. If I want to learn English, I don't want to buy British and American works. Instead, I go to Korean works. Now only when the garbage is thrown away, money is wasted. 
0	The XP system is really hard to install. It has been a few days since I bought it, but it still has no effect after changing a few people to help install it. 
0	Quite boring book. The content is very close to life, maybe because it is too close to life, but there is nothing to see. 
0	"""Odd Books"" are not considered to be! Just looking at the results, success is good, but not everything has to be said. . . "
1	The style of this notebook is novel and the appearance is really good, but the performance is not known until after using it. 
1	I gave the check to JD.com last Friday. It's Thursday morning and I haven't got anything yet. At present, a mouse and anti-virus software have been added as a gift. It is estimated that there will be no mine. 
1	"Not all the articles in ""Zhuangzi"" must be made by Zhuangzi himself. Everyone should treat it correctly. Read ""Zhuangzi"" to understand with your heart. If you test what others teach, at most it is the opinions that others have digested. We must first have certain Understand and combine various viewpoints to better understand the mystery. Besides, this book needs to be translated again, and the original content of ""Zhuangzi"" is so much. How could it be the whole book? Naturally, you should pay attention when choosing it. Many people like to criticize the limitations of historical figures. It must not be the case. Just imagine that in 2000, who can guarantee that future generations will not criticize us for our limitations? "
1	"The service of the Blue Sky Hotel is absolutely good. Every hotel staff smiles when they see every guest and says: ""Hello!"" The service is very attentive, the restaurant’s dishes are also very good, and the facilities are very complete. Our family is very satisfied with the five-star service and decided to go to Weihai next time and stay at Lantian Hotel. "
0	The voice is too small, the association with my girlfriend is really smaller than the voice! It can only be equipped with an external speaker! There is a bit less memory. 
1	"Because your son will always make you crazy sometimes, will always make you beat him in the ass when you lose patience, but when he says to the phone that he misses you, he is so sweet. I bought this book because I wanted to be more patient when I lost my patience, and to be more tolerant when he was naughty. After reading this book, I think I got more things. Yes, every child is the best gift, and the ""creation"" of parents should accompany the child's growth. It is worth reading, a book that makes people feel warm and full of hope. "
1	1. Exquisite workmanship; 2. Starting up and running time is almost 4 hours, basically enough. But pay attention to the first few times to charge fully to activate the battery; 3. The other is the selling point of the machine introduced by ViewSonic itself, and the computer desk sent is really light, but a little smaller. 
0	Not an xp system, but a linux system. I’m not used to it, but it’s a choice for those who study linux. 
1	This book is very interesting, because I like Ruan Ji personally, so I sold this book, Ruan Ji mentioned in this book is very cute! I like him so much, but on the contrary, I don’t have much interest in Ji Kang, but after all, he is one of the seven sages of the bamboo forest. Sometimes he is still very cute. When the book breaks! They are all cute, but Ruan Ji is my favorite! ! ! This book is very interesting, with a bit of joking, but it is more interesting than looking dull and formal. You can read this book by referring to the official history (this is also a personal opinion.) 
0	The hotel is really bad. There are four towels on the wall and you can't take away the four towels. To be honest, don't give them for nothing. Old ones can only wipe the floor. Not disposable slippers, the shower head water is very runny. The sheets and quilts were not very clean. The room is not soundproof, and I was awakened by the strange cough next door in the middle of the night, and could no longer fall asleep. We booked two rooms and received a harassing call at the same time. It may be that we were both answered by the lady, and the other party hung up without speaking. The worst part is the underground garage, which is dark and humid, with a lot of mosquitoes, cars and bicycles mixed together without partitions, and no one is watching when they enter the warehouse. Someone opens the door when they leave the warehouse. In fact, the garage is not big, and there is only one floor. Just a little renovation can change the current situation, but no one pays attention to these details. I greeted the front desk at noon to check out. After I went up to pick up the luggage, I was called to say that we were overtime and the service was terrible. There is no satisfactory place to live in Penglai. It is better to live in Yantai or Weihai after visiting Penglai. Supplementary review August 1, 2007: How come there are sea view rooms even a few blocks away from the sea? I don't know what they think! 
0	I set a deluxe standard room through Ctrip at a price of 400 yuan. I thought that this price would at least be enough to stay in a clean and tidy hotel. I was shocked; when I entered the room, there was a mixture of musty and stinky smell; when I entered the toilet, I realized that the smell of the room was nothing compared to that, Jane 
1	"This set of books is not bad! The lonely old man is no longer lonely and bored because of messing with the cat. The human touch inside is very heavy, and his son likes it very much. Every day when I sleep, I pull a book from the bookshelf and let me tell him on the bedside. Sometimes he turned to look at it himself, because the pictures were so rich, he could see things other than words in it. For example, in an episode, there was a colorful one in the frame of the egg. He quickly found out, saying ""Easter egg ""! In fact, that article has nothing to do with Easter. There are also some details, I really want to draw things that are unique to children's world that adults can't see, small animals, strange bionic furniture... "
0	I don't feel very good about this hotel. Let me talk about the shortcomings first: 1 The subway is under repair at the door, which is very noisy. 2 The decoration of the hotel is known as the perfect combination of avant-garde and classic, but I personally find it flashy. 3 The hallway of the room is dark, and I can't see my fingers. 4 The Ministry of Commerce collects money for a broken computer and a broken stool. 5 The restaurant of the hotel is outsourced, it is very inconvenient to eat, and the breakfast is very very poor. Advantages: 1 The bedding and pillows in the room are very clean. 2 Good location, in the business district of Hangzhou. 3 Check-out is delayed until 2 pm, probably because of the low occupancy rate. 
0	We did a field comparison with local hotels. The hardware here is fairly good, and the decoration is relatively new, but it can’t be too high. I live in a suite, but there is no TV in the bedroom and the broadband is not available. It is said that it is under maintenance! Deaf ears-furnishings. 
0	The password cannot be set after the update patch, which made me almost redo the system. The sound is a bit poor, a bit expensive, and a bit heavy 
0	A book that teaches women how to make a completely material assembly line product. Koreans are really very material. This book is a good reflection. A normal person has thoughts and emotions, and because of this, society will be very Colorful. 
1	The original intention of buying this book was to show it to my sister who was in college, and the results were better than I expected. I have paid close attention to Mr. Kaifu's experience and works a long time ago, but I read it all on the Internet. This is the first time I really bought a book. After calmly looking at it, I feel that children nowadays should read this book carefully. Whether they are older or younger, I think the sooner the children are in contact with this, the better. They lack too much in this regard. This has something to do with the education of parents and the current education system in China. 
1	I bought this book under the recommendation of seniors and teachers. It is said that it is very similar to the difficulty and situation of the postgraduate entrance examination, which is conducive to improving my level and recognizing my English reading ability. After I bought it, I did it at the speed of a few articles per day, analyzed, understood... I felt like I was about to collapse~ Although my English level was not high, but seeing the accuracy rate hovering around 40%, I suddenly realized that it is indeed very similar to the style of postgraduate entrance examination. , Ha ha... Although it is a blow to confidence, I think the questions are still very suitable for the difficulty of the exam. For students who want to find confidence, it is still... forget it~~~ 
1	The classic shape, the piano paint is very beautiful. It looks very comfortable! The performance of the machine is also very good, and the speed is very fast. Nothing to say about IBM! 
1	The room facilities are good, very complete, very comfortable, and not old-fashioned. It is worthy of being a NOVOTEL hotel. The price of 520 is super bargain. The service is also good, and all my requests have been responded quickly. But The West Ring Road is too far away, the traffic is not convenient, and there is no subway nearby, so I can only wait for the hotel shuttle bus every hour. It is not cost-effective to take TAXI, it costs more than 100 for a round trip. 
0	1. The hotel is in black and white tones, which feels gloomy. . It is recommended that friends who like this type of film live 2. The bed looks like a tatami mat, and it's short and messy, so I suggest Japanese friends live 3. The glass in the bath room is actually transparent. It is recommended to have friends who like to be naked to live. 4. The toilet in the room is broken. Every time you flush it, you must open the ceramic lid to repair it. It is recommended that friends who like DIY live. Additional comments March 12, 2008: Not to mention the TV show, the so-called 5star standard, shame. . . There is no place to eat, and you have to go out for 20 minutes to Jiuzhou Road. The restaurant downstairs is only suitable for arrogant guests. . 
1	"N watched ""Amber"" in Shanghai many years ago, and I didn't know it was Liao Yimei's, because the actor (Liu Ye) and beautiful women covered her light. I watched ""Rhino in Love"" at the drama center last year and was surrounded by a group of scalpers, only to realize that her drama was so popular. This is a good book. I remember many details in the book. For example, it is about men getting old and mature. For example, it is not practical for beauty. For example, the quoted ""Opinions on the Life of Two Dogs"" about the door . "
1	The door of the hotel looks very stylish, the lobby is very individual, and the rooms maintain the same style, with green wood grain and masonry walls, simple without losing personality, much like an express hotel. It's worth it in terms of price. 
1	"""Feifei is Angry"" tells children that getting angry is a normal emotional reaction, and it is often caused by feeling offended. There is a good analogy in the book to illustrate the state of being angry: there seems to be a big volcano about to erupt inside. Once, my daughter who was almost four years old lost her temper. I told her that I felt like there was a big volcano in you, which made me feel very uncomfortable. I wanted to avoid you and stay away... .... After she listened, she pondered for a while, maybe because she thought of the relevant plot in the book, she understood something, and soon calmed down... "
1	The appearance is beautiful, the speed is very fast, the most important thing is that it is super convenient to carry, and the battery life is very strong! 
0	The standard memory is too small, so I added one! There is no built-in recovery CD, there is a problem with the driver after reinstalling the system, and the built-in shortcut keys cannot be used. Fortunately, all drivers can be downloaded and used on the website. 
1	Yes, the surroundings are very lively, convenient to travel, and no worries about finding a place to eat. You can take the 973 bus to Repulse Bay, Stanley, Ocean Park (main entrance), and the station is nearby. The rooms are small, but the price is acceptable. The bellboy service is very good, and they are very helpful in asking directions, even though the Mandarin is not very good. But the lady who stayed in the lobby felt that it was not suitable for the service industry. It's not that the attitude is bad, but there is no smile without saying, and the brow is always frowned. 
1	After reading the book, I feel that Chinese medicine will not die out for the time being. There are still one or twenty old trees alive, and a group of doctors with certain clinical experience, such as Mao Yilin, Huang Huang, and Liu Lihong, can delay his life, but Do not change the current school-running model of the Chinese Medicine Hospital, change the education method, improve the clinical level of students, and discard the medicine and keep medicine, and sooner or later will die. The current clinical level of Chinese medicine, including the level of the professors at the University of Chinese Medicine in my city, is really not flattering. It is conceivable what level such a professor will educate students. 
0	I haven't read this book to the end, I don't particularly like it. I can use the preface evaluation to express my feelings: I can be tolerant, but I don't want to practice. In addition to material, there are many things we want to pursue. 
1	Although it is a viewing room, but the floor I live on is too low (19th floor) to see the river view, but the location is very good, very close to the light rail Linjiangmen station and Jiaochangkou station (starting point), the Jiefangbei is nearby ( It's about more than 100 meters)! 
1	Good value for money and convenient transportation. The executive floor feels very good, but the decoration is upstairs at 8 am, so noisy. The quality of the Chinese restaurant is too low. Although it is cheap, it does not match the quality of the hotel. 
0	There is no essential difference from the soul chicken soup. At least I don’t like to read the classics like this, and interpret the classics as such a taste of de-Chinese.
